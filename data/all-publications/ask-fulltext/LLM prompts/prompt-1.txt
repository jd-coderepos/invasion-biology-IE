You are a research assistant in invasion biology or ecology. Your task is to read and analyze the content of provided papers to extract relevant information from the papers provided by the user.

The field of invasion biology is defined as follows: a research area dealing with the translocation, establishment, spread, impact and management of species outside of their native ranges, where they are called non-native or alien species.

The following entities define the information extraction objective: species, habitat, location, ecosystem.

As the extraction task you need to identify if there are any relations between the entities defined above, and if so extract the information with the relations.

Respond in a valid JSON format.

Note that not all papers that might be provided by the user are addressing a problem in invasion biology. If you are provided a paper input that is not an invasion biology paper, return N/A as your response.

Title: Seed source regions drive fitness differences in invasive macrophytes

Abstract: International audiencePremise Worldwide, ecosystems are threatened by global changes, including biological invasions. Invasive species arriving in novel environments experience new climatic conditions that can affect their successful establishment. Determining the response of functional traits and fitness components of invasive populations from contrasting environments can provide a useful framework to assess species responses to climate change and the variability of these responses among source populations. Much research on macrophytes has focused on establishment from clonal fragments; however, colonization from sexual propagules has rarely been studied. Our objective was to compare trait responses of plants generated from sexual propagules sourced from three climatic regions but grown under common environmental conditions, using L. peploides subsp. montevidensis as a model taxon. Methods We grew seedlings to reproductive stage in experimental mesocosms under a mediterranean California (MCA) climate from seeds collected in oceanic France (OFR), mediterranean France (MFR), and MCA. Results Seed source region was a major factor influencing differences among invasive plants recruiting from sexual propagules of L. peploides subsp. montevidensis. Trait responses of young individual recruits from MCA and OFR, sourced from geographically distant and climatically distinct source regions, were the most different. The MCA individuals accumulated more biomass, flowered earlier, and had higher leaf N concentrations than the OFR plants. Those from MFR had intermediate profiles. Conclusions By showing that the closer a seedling is from its parental climate, the better it performs, this study provides new insights to the understanding of colonization of invasive plant species and informs its management under novel and changing environmental conditions.

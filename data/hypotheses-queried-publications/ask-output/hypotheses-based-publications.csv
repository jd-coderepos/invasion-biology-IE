Where biological invasions have occurred, however, invasive alien species should have negative effects on indigenous faunal assemblages. To assess these predictions, we provide the first systematic ecological survey of the Collembola assemblages of pristine, sub-Antarctic Heard Island (53.1°S, 73.5°E) and compare the results to similarly conducted surveys of three other sub-Antarctic islands (Marion, Prince Edward, and Macquarie), characterised by assemblages including invasive Collembola. In particular, we examine differences in densities of three indigenous species (Cryptopygus antarcticus, Mucrosomia caeca, Tullbergia bisetosa) shared between the invaded islands and Heard Island. On average, density of these species was four or more-fold significantly lower on the invaded islands than on uninvaded Heard Island. Yet mean assemblage densities of springtails, accounting for variation among vegetation communities, did not differ substantially or significantly among the islands, suggesting that compensatory dynamics may be a feature of these systems. The invasion impact prediction of the ACDI is therefore supported. On Heard Island, indigenous assemblage variation is strongly related to vegetation community and less so to elevation, in keeping with investigations of Collembola assemblage variation elsewhere across the Antarctic. These findings, in the context of field experimental and physiological data on Collembola from the region, suggest that the climate-diversity predictions of the ACDI will play out in different ways across the Antarctic, depending on whether precipitation increases or decreases as climates change",,text,"Antarctica, Invasion impacts, Neutral theory, Springtail, Turnover",,'Elsevier BV'
Antarctic climate-diversity-invasion hypothesis,484099662,Invaders in waiting? Non-equilibrium in Southern Hemisphere seaweed distributions may lead to underestimation of Antarctic invasion potential,,"Laeseke, Philipp, Martínez, Brezo, Mansilla, Andrés, Bischof, Kai",2021,"Bioinvasions pose a major threat to global biodiversity. Correlative Ecological Niche Models (ENMs) can be a valuable tool to identify invaders and invasion sites. However, in cases when species are in non-equilibrium with their native environment (i.e. do not fill their niche), correlative approaches have limited power and invasions lead to shifts of the realized niche. In recent years, several new seaweed species have been reported in Antarctica. It is impossible to unequivocally identify which of these species are truly non-natives, however, here, we provide literature-based evidence that seaweed species have been introduced to Antarctica. Under this assumption, we reconstruct pre- and post-introduction niches of these species, calculate relative niche sizes and overlap between pre-Antarctic and Antarctic sites, and evaluate increase in niche size due to inclusion of Antarctic habitats. In seven species, the absolute occupied temperature range is dramatically enlarged, with minimum sea surface temperature (SST) being 2-5°C lower than in the pre-Antarctic ranges. In all species except one, summer SST is 5-20°C lower than in the pre-Antarctic ranges. As a result, several species’ niches increase dramatically. We hypothesize that species from the Southern Hemisphere do not cover their whole abiotically suitable range due to lack of settling substrate in cold-water regions while species from the Northern Hemisphere tend to fill their niches to a greater degree due to higher connectivity between tropic and polar regions along coastlines. Thus, while correlative ENMs for Northern Hemisphere species will probably be successful in predicting Antarctica as a suitable habitat, such models will likely be insufficient to do so for Southern Hemisphere species. From a precautionary standpoint, we argue that not only species from climatically matching regions pose an invasion threat for Antarctica, but that also species from other, climatically non-matching regions, might be potential invaders. In light of higher connectivity of the Antarctic continent with other continents this finding significantly increases invasion risk for Antarctica",,article,"barrier, bioinvasions, ecological niche modelling, intertidal, marine, niche shifts, polar, South Shetland Islands, species distribution modelling",,"eScholarship, University of California"

Key to their strategies is prevention, including assessment of establishment risk for alien species. Despite establishment of some of the worst globally invasive species across the Antarctic region, assessments of establishment potential of these species are non-existent. Here, we address this deficit and determine whether these invasive species constitute a significant conservation threat to the broader Antarctic region both now and in response to future regional climate change. Location: Antarctica and the Southern Ocean islands (45°–90° S). Methods: We used ensemble species distribution models to assess the current and future climate suitability of the Antarctic region for 69 of the worst globally invasive species and 24 insect and plant species that have already established somewhere in the region. Results: The Antarctic continent is unsuitable for all of the worst globally invasive species under current conditions, but areas of the Antarctic Peninsula are predicted to become climatically suitable for up to six globally invasive species within the next century. By contrast, all Southern Ocean islands are presently climatically suitable for additional non-native species, with the threat increasing in the future. Main conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that climate, which is often cited as a key barrier to alien species establishment, may afford some protection to continental Antarctica, but that this protection is not currently extended to the Southern Ocean islands. Furthermore, existing climatic barriers to alien species establishment will weaken as warming continues across the region. This not only illustrates the value of applying distribution modelling methods to this largely ice-covered region, but demonstrates how these methods can be used to inform targeted surveillance of introduction pathways and sites that have the highest risk of establishment of invasive alien species.</p",,article,"Alien species, Biological invasions, Environmental niche, Sub-Antarctic island, Invasive species risk-assessment, species distribution modelling",,

To date, examples include a small number of vascular plants and a greater diversity of invertebrates (including Diptera, Collembola, Acari and Oligochaeta), which share features of pre-adaptation to the environmental stresses experienced in Antarctica. In this synthesis, we examine multiple classic invasion science hypotheses that are widely considered to have relevance in invasion ecology and assess their utility in understanding the different invasion histories so far documented in the continent. All of these existing hypotheses appear relevant to some degree in explaining invasion processes in Antarctica. They are also relevant in understanding failed invasions and identifying barriers to invasion. However, the limited number of cases currently available constrains the possibility of establishing patterns and processes.

The large majority of aliens are European in origin. They have both direct and indirect impacts on the functioning of species-poor Antarctic ecosystems, in particular including substantial loss of local biodiversity and changes to ecosystem processes. With rapid climate change occurring in some parts of Antarctica, elevated numbers of introductions and enhanced success of colonization by aliens are likely, with consequent increases in impacts on ecosystems.

Antarctic climate-diversity-invasion hypothesis,539919654,Latitudinal patterns of biological invasions in marine ecosystems : a polar perspective,,"G Ruiz (9896852), Chad Hewitt (9803666)",2009,"Biological invasions in coastal ecosystems have occurred throughout Earth’s history, but the scale and tempo have increased greatly in recent time due to human-mediated dispersal. Available data suggest that a strong latitudinal pattern exists for such human introductions in coastal systems. The documented number of introduced species (with established, self-sustaining populations) is greatest in temperate regions and declines sharply at higher latitudes. This observed invasion pattern across latitudes may result from differences in (1) historical baseline knowledge, (2) propagule supply, (3) resistance to invasion, and (4) disturbance regime. To date, the relative importance of these mechanisms across geographic regions has not been evaluated, and each may be expected to change over time. Of particular interest and concern are the interactive effects of climate change and human activities on marine invasions at high latitudes. Shifts in invasion dynamics may be especially pronounced in the Northern Hemisphere, where current models predict not only an increase in sea surface temperatures but also a rapid reduction in sea ice in the Arctic. These environmental changes may greatly increase invasion opportunity at high northern latitudes due to shipping, mineral exploration, shoreline development, and other human responses",,"Text, Conference contribution","Environment policy, Expanding Knowledge in the Environmental Sciences, Environment Policy",,

Non-native marine species will interact with other anthropogenic stressors affecting Antarctic ecosystems, such as climate change (warming, ocean acidification) and pollution, with irreversible ramifications for biodiversity and ecosystem services. We review current knowledge of non-native marine species in the Antarctic region, the physical and physiological factors that resist establishment of non-native marine species, changes to resistance under climate change, the role of legislation in limiting marine introductions, and the effect of increasing human activity on vectors and pathways of introduction. Evidence of non-native marine species is limited: just four marine non-native and one cryptogenic species that were likely introduced anthropogenically have been reported freely living in Antarctic or sub-Antarctic waters, but no established populations have been reported; an additional six species have been observed in pathways to Antarctica that are potentially at risk of becoming invasive. We present estimates of the intensity of ship activity across fishing, tourism and research sectors: there may be approximately 180 vessels and 500+ voyages in Antarctic waters annually. However, these estimates are necessarily speculative because relevant data are scarce.

These two species exhibit contrasting introduction histories and reproductive strategies and represent two referential case studies of biological invasion processes. We used a multistep process with a range of species distribution modelling techniques (ecological niche factor analysis, multidimensional envelopes, distance/entropy algorithms) together with a suite of thermoclimatic variables, to characterize the potential ranges of these species. Their native bioclimatic thermal envelopes in Eurasia, together with the different naturalized populations across continents, were compared next. The potential niche of P. pratensis was wider at the cold extremes; however, P. annua life history attributes enable it to be a more successful colonizer. We observe that particularly cold summers are a key aspect of the unique Antarctic environment. In consequence, ruderals such as P. annua can quickly expand under such harsh conditions, whereas the more stress-tolerant P. pratensis endures and persist through steady growth. Compiled data on human pressure at the Antarctic Peninsula allowed us to provide site-specific biosecurity risk indicators. We conclude that several areas across the region are vulnerable to invasions from these and other similar species. This can only be visualized in species distribution models (SDMs) when accounting for founder populations that reveal nonanalogous conditions.

Antarctic climate-diversity-invasion hypothesis,584373527,Alien species and propagules in the Antarctic: movements though space and time,10.5281/zenodo.4751596,"Lee, Jennifer",2009,"Although the impacts of biological invasions are widely appreciated, a bias exists in research effort to post-dispersal processes because of the difficulties of measuring propagule pressure and the detecting of newly established species. Here the Antarctic is used as a model system in which to quantify the initial dispersal of alien species and investigate the factors that contribute to the establishment and range dynamics of alien species once they have arrived in the region.  Human movements are known to transport alien species into the Antarctic, some of which have successfully established and had wide ranging consequences in recipient ecosystems. Considering terrestrial flora, this research found that over 700 seeds from 99 taxa, including some species known to be invasive, are transported into the Antarctic each year in association with South African National Antarctic Programme (SANAP) passenger luggage and cargo. The first ever assessment of propagule drop-off indicated that 30-50% of these propagules will enter the recipient environment. Further results suggested that the construction of the British Antarctic Survey Halley VI station will facilitate the transport of over 5000 seeds from 34 taxa into the region, making this a significant pathway for introductions.   Propagule pressure due to SANAP logistics is also considerable for marine species. Fouling assemblages on the external hull surfaces of the SANAP resupply vessel, the SA Agulhas, form only once the vessel's anti-fouling paint has been damaged by travel through sea ice and are characterised by low diversity. Ice scour prevents fouling assemblages from being transported to the Antarctic continent, but assemblages remain largely intact when travelling to sub-Antarctic Islands. In the sea-chests of the vessel populations of a known invasive, Mytilus galloprovincialis, were found with some individuals having survived transportation to the Antarctic region on multiple occasions.  Once species have overcome initial dispersal barriers, they face further ecological and physiological challenges in order to establish in the recipient region. The parasitoid wasp Aphidius matricariae was first recorded on Marion Island in 2001. Surveys around the island show that adult abundance and the frequency of aphid parasitism are highest adjacent to a common anchor point of the SA Agulhas and decline away from this region. Genetic diversity was low, suggesting that the population was established from a single introduction. This highlights that high propagule pressure is not necessary for successful establishment of introduced invertebrates.        Another species that has overcome the dispersal barrier is the terrestrial slug Deroceras panormitanum, which was introduced to Marion Island in the 1970's and has since spread throughout much of the coastal habitat of the island. For this species range limits are set by intolerance of low temperature and salinity, and abundance structure is characterized by patches and gaps which are associated with this species inability to tolerate dry conditions.   To prevent further alien introductions in the region, targeted management of high risk pathways is required. In addition, increased vigilance is needed to detect and manage newly established aliens before their ranges expand.To assess propagule movements and establishment of alien species in the Antarctic region",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/other, dataset","Botany, PhD",,

So far, Antarctic biodiversity has been little affected by non-native species introductions owing to: (i) the late arrival of humans on the continent (c. 1820); (ii) the overall low intensity of human activity relative to other continents; and (iii) the concentration of most of that activity around a relatively limited number of research stations and tourist sites, particularly on and near to the Antarctic Peninsula and in the McMurdo region of Victoria Land. However, human activity is increasing, and Antarctica is increasingly vulnerable to both the human-mediated importation of non-native species and the redistribution of indigenous Antarctic species between biologically distinct areas within the continent. The Antarctic Peninsula warmed rapidly during the second half of the 20th century, and parts of the Antarctic continent are now starting to warm, with more widespread and substantial change expected over the next century. Consequently, terrestrial communities are increasingly vulnerable as climate change increases the risk of non-native species establishment and dispersal. In this chapter we describe the legislation and practices relating to non-native species in Antarctica, and present examples of non-native species that have already become established and details of the resulting management responses.

Location Antarctica and surrounding regions.    Methods First, mechanisms of and evidence for long-term isolation are reviewed. These include continental drift, the development of a surrounding deep-water channel and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). They also include levels of endemism, richness and distinctiveness of assemblages. Secondly, evidence for past and modern opportunities for species transport are investigated. Comparative levels of alien establishments are also examined around the Southern Ocean.    Discussion On a Cenozoic time-scale, it is clear that Gondwana's fragmentation led to increasing geographical isolation of Antarctica and the initiation of the ACC, which restricted biota exchange to low levels while still permitting some movement of biota. On a shorter Quaternary time-scale, the continental ice-sheet, influenced by solar (Milankovitch) cycles, has expanded and contracted periodically, covering and exposing terrestrial and continental shelf habitats. There were probably refugia for organisms during each glacial maxima. It is also likely that new taxa were introduced into Antarctica during cycles of ice sheet and oceanic front movement. The current situation (a glacial minimum) is not 'normal'; full interglacials represent only 10% of the last 430 ka. On short (ecological) time-scales, many natural dispersal processes (airborne, oceanic eddy, rafting and hitch-hiking on migrants) enable the passage of biota to and from Antarctica. In recent years, humans have become influential both directly by transporting organisms and indirectly by increasing survival and establishment prospects via climate change.    Main conclusions Patterns of endemism and alien establishment are very different across taxa, land and sea, and north vs. south of the Polar Frontal Zone. Establishment conditions, as much as transport, are important in limiting alien establishment. Three time-scales emerge as important in the modification of Antarctica's biota.

The dynamics of functional connectivity, propagule pressure and spatio-temporal patterns of propagule arrival associated with human activity and climate change belonging to the system context contribute to an increase in the threat of invasions. Due to the still low land transport activity migration pathways are limited and will reduce the spread of alien terrestrial organisms by land.

An almost full enemy release (low pres-sure of consumers), the high patchiness of the habitat, and the prevalence of open gaps also associated with habitat invasibility increase the possibility of invasion. The dynamics of functional connectivity, propagule pressure and spatio-temporal patterns of propagule arrival associated with human activity and climate change belonging to the system context contribute to an increase in the threat of invasions. Due to the still low land transport activ-ity migration pathways are limited and will reduce the spread of alien terrestrial organisms by land. An effective way of preventing invasions in Antarctica seems to lie in reducing propagule pressure and eliminating alien populations as early as possible.

The intensification of human activity in this zone generates an array of environmental changes that increase the probability of bio-logical invasions (e.g., Frenot et al. 2005; Chwedorzewska 2009; Convey 2010).In the last few years, numerous papers have focused on understanding the mechanisms and predicting the processes of biological invasions. Among other things, they discuss the traits of the invasive species likely to successfully expand in a new ecosystem (e.g., Kleunen et al. 2010; Moles et al. 2008), predict the effects of climate change (Gilman et al. 2010), or search for links between ecological and evolutional changes (Facon et al. 2006). These theoretic and conceptual works are also intended to be applicable for developing management (research and conservation) programs, and their theoretical frameworks are “tools to organize research and evaluate the state of a subject area” (Foxcroft et al. 2011; McGeoch et  al. 2015; Thomsen et  al. 2011). Many models and frameworks, either of a broad nature (e.g., Blackburn et al. 2011; Gilman et al. 2010; Moles et al. 2008; Thomsen et  al. 2011), or describing specific species and/or regions (e.g., Facon et  al. 2006; Fox-croft et al. 2011; McGeoch et al. 2015) have been proposed by their authors as appropriate for the analysis of other invasions. However, to our knowledge such use has seldom been reported in the literature (Vardien et al. 2012).Out of these numerous works, “Expanding the conceptual frameworks of plant invasion ecology” (Foxcroft et al. 2011) deserves special attention as this work aims at “identify-ing the internal features of the receiving site and the nature of the potential invaders”. The framework had been applied to describe two plant species invasions in South Africa region (Foxcroft et al. 2011; Vardien et al. 2012). In order to evaluate if the application of an exist-ing framework in a new context is possible, we assessed the threat of biological invasions in the Maritime Antarctic using the framework of Foxcroft et al. (2011). We do not address a one region to one species relation, but analyze external factors that contributed to the susceptibility of the Maritime Antarctic region to invasions. The novelty in our work lies in evaluating whether such a framework can be used to analyze different invasion scenarios in a different context and with multiple species.MethodsWe analyzed literature on species alien to continental and Maritime Antarctica noted in the vicinity of the H. Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station situated on the western shore of Admiralty Bay on King George Island (hereinafter KGI), South Shetland archipel-ago, West Antarctica; 62°10′S, 58°28′W. The Arctowski Station lies within the Point Thomas Oasis. This is one of the largest seasonally ice-free areas (approx. 25  km2, Biodivers Conserv 1 3Lityńska-Zając et al. 2012) in the Maritime Antarctic region with relatively high tem-peratures during the austral summer (Galera et al. 2015; Kejna et al. 2013) and a con-stant flow of fresh water (Nędzarek et al. 2014) throughout most of the summer season from December to February, inclusive (Kejna et  al. 2013, Braun et  al. 2017, Sancho et al. 2017). It is also one of the most environmentally favorable areas in the Maritime Antarctic (Lityńska-Zając et al. 2012), therefore the most likely location in the whole region for biological invasions. The spatial isolation of this area and well documented logistics of the Polish Antarctic Station located there enabled a detailed assessment of the key driving factors for the probability of a successful invasion in the whole region. Environmental changes on KGI are an example of complicated processes taking place in the Maritime Antarctic region. We compared the reported incidents of alien species appearance with similar problems from other parts of the world, especially on spatially isolated islands.Our work has been arranged according to the expanded framework by Foxcroft et al. (2011) taking into account three groups of contributing factors: habitat susceptibility (invasibility of the habitat), system context (spatially explicit connectivity between the systems supplying and/or transporting potential invaders and habitat susceptibility to alien organisms), and species invasiveness (traits that predispose a species to be inva-sive). We considered the probability of biological invasions in Maritime Antarctic with detailed analysis of habitat susceptibility and system context. We do not concentrate on species invasiveness, as we analyze the threat of future invasions not knowing prop-agules of which species will arrive in the studied region. The sequence of ‘specific mechanisms’ in the Fig. 1 corresponds to the order of sub-chapters in our work.Habitat invasibility System context Species invasivenessSpecific mechanisms:•Geographical barrier – strong spatial isolation•Potential bioclimatic suitability – harsh climatic conditions•Resource availability – spatial and temporal diversity of trophic conditions•Native biodiversity – low richness of autochthonous species•Enemy release – low pressure of terrestrial consumers•Patchiness of habitat and open gaps– mosaic of microhabitats and low competitionSpecific mechanisms:•Migration pathways – limited transport capability•Functional connectivity – factors enabling the survival of alien propagules during transport•Propagule pressure – diversity of propagules reaching target region•Spatial and temporal patterns of propagule arrival – potential invasion hotspots associated with human occupied sites•Global change – rapid climate change•Residence time – low probability of survival through the lag phaseSpecific mechanisms:High plasticity, high resistance of propagules to harsh transport and habitat conditions, other mechanisms dependenton the invader speciesMain groups of contributing factors:Composite problem: What affects the probability of biological invasions in Antarctica?Fig. 1  A framework for the assessment of probability of biological invasions in Antarctica showing factors affecting the likelihood of an invasion. The diagram structure refers to Foxcroft et al. (2011) and Vardien et al. (2012) (slightly changed) Biodivers Conserv1 3Invasibility of the habitatIt is generally acknowledged that islands are more susceptible to invasion than continen-tal habitats due to prolonged isolation, low competitive capability of the native species, and empty ecological niches (Alpert et al. 2000; Brandes 2008; Trueman et al. 2010). This phe-nomenon has been studied extensively in tropical oceanic islands (Daehler 2006; Kueffer et al. 2010). On the other hand, a small island well isolated by geographic barriers, for example by specific ocean and air currents, may receive very limited propagule pressure, making it resist-ant to invasion due to its remoteness. Therefore, an invasion of an open habitat containing resources for the invader is not possible without the existence of dispersal corridors (Grime 2001).Discrepancies between reports indicate that the relation between the degree of island isola-tion and target habitat invasibility is not a simple one and in every instance can be governed by different factors (e.g., Daehler 2006; Kueffer et al. 2010; Von Holle and Simberloff 2005). Frenot et al. (2005) stated that cold islands are less susceptible to invasions than warm ones. For insects a similar relationship holds, although indigenous vascular plant richness is also an important correlate of the richness of alien insects. Investigations by Chown et al. (1998) sug-gested that larger Southern Ocean islands attract more human occupants, increasing the risk of alien organism transfer, while milder climate increases the chance of propagule establishment.Geographical barrier—strong spatial isolation of Point Thomas OasisThe Antarctic terrestrial and marine ecosystems are strongly isolated, without any gradual connectivity with those at lower latitudes. The isolation process commenced with the breakup of Gondwana and was maintained by the atmospheric Polar Vortex and oceanic Polar Frontal Zone (e.g., Barnes et al. 2006; Clarke et al. 2005; Convey 2010). Oceanic and atmospheric circulation patterns around the Antarctic significantly restrict the transfer of organisms into this region. Terrestrial ecosystems have developed on the ice-free “environmental islands” restricted to the coastal zones of the Antarctic Peninsula and the associated islands (e.g., Con-vey 2010; Houghton et al. 2016; Hughes and Convey 2010).One of such “island-like” enclaves is the Point Thomas Oasis on KGI, located approxi-mately 160 km from the Antarctic Peninsula (Zwolicki et  al. 2015). Although the distance from KGI to the nearest continent is relatively short in comparison with other oceanic islands (Kueffer et al. 2010), the nearest continent is Antarctica which is a marginal source of prop-agules. Therefore, the studied ice-free oasis is one of the most isolated areas on Earth, being separated from other terrestrial communities on the island by permanently glaciated zones (90% of KGI is ice covered year-round; Kejna et al. 2013; Zwolicki et al. 2015). There are over a dozen research stations and refuges located on KGI. Land transport between the sta-tions is highly restricted or non-existent, apart from the U.S.A. Copacabana Field Camp sum-mer station which is situated within walking distance of Arctowski Station (Kejna et al. 2013; Pudełko 2007). Travel between the other stations in the different polar oases is accomplished mainly by sea routes.Potential bioclimatic suitability—harsh climatic conditions of Point Thomas OasisThe isolation of Antarctic islands is a result not only of the physical distance to other con-tinents, but also of ecological isolation (Barnes et al. 2006; Clarke et al. 2005). Similarities Biodivers Conserv 1 3in environmental features between potential propagule source areas and the Maritime Ant-arctic zone are low. Harsh abiotic conditions on KGI are the main selective ecological filter for propagules of terrestrial organisms, diminishing the probability of their establishment. In this way, both spatial and ecological isolation may play the most important role in Ant-arctic islands invasibility (e.g., Alpert et al. 2000).The typical polar maritime climate on KGI can be described as extremely inhospitable for terrestrial organisms, especially for alien homeohydric species. Mean monthly tempera-tures of 2.4  °C in January (warmest month during the austral summer) and − 6.7  °C in July (coldest month, data from Admiralty Bay, see Galera et al. 2015) together with high variation in daylight duration (ca 4.5–19.5 h, Kejna et al. 2013) may highly impact the fit-ness of introduced organisms. The difficult environmental conditions are also shaped by cyclic freezing and melting, humidifying and drying, high intensity of solar radiation in summer, including UVB, lack of light in winter, and the strong winds which act both as a desiccation and an abrasion factor (Giełwanowska et al. 2011). For potential invaders from Europe, the temporal shift between summer seasons in the Northern and Southern Hemi-spheres (Galera et  al. 2015) may also present a problem in adjustment of physiological traits associated with their phenology.For small terrestrial plants and animals capable of physiological dormancy, the thick snow cover increases the likelihood of survival by providing an insulating blanket of snow where they can remain unaffected by the low temperatures and strong desiccating winds (Ochyra et al. 2008). At the same time the snow cover can extend the cold season by preserving cold temperature close to the soil surface and shortening the growing sea-son (Schroeter et al. 2010 and literature cited therein). In comparison with other Antarctic bioregions the mean yearly precipitation on KGI is relatively high (about 700 mm, Kejna et al. 2013); however, due to prevailing subzero temperatures organisms may still be sub-ject to physiological drought. Nevertheless, the Point Thomas Oasis seems to be one of the most favorable areas for living organisms in the whole of the Maritime Antarctic.Resource availability—spatial and temporal diversity of trophic conditions of Point Thomas OasisThe primary production of Maritime Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems is extremely low, making autochthonous resources of biogenic substance minimal (Williams 1994; Hop-kins et al. 2014). Vegetation communities in this region depend largely on marine-derived biogenic substances (main vectors—marine birds and pinnipeds, Green et al. 2015). The animal-mediated nutrient deposition creates spatially restricted over-fertilized sites (ornith-ogenic soils, Tatur et al. 1997). In contrast, deglaciation processes offer sites with a substra-tum nearly entirely devoid of organic matter. The chemical weathering of rocks, the most important source of nutrients in other climatic zones, is strongly inhibited in severe polar climates (Nędzarek 2008). These contrasting processes make habitats of Point Thomas Oasis very diverse in pH and substratum fertility (Tatur et al. 1997; Zwolicki et al. 2015). Typical for polar coastal oases, the most important limiting environmental factors are water and salinity stress (physiological drought and saline aerosols, Giełwanowska et al. 2011). The Antarctic substratum is characterized by instability due to the exfoliation of rock sur-faces and cryoturbation of soil and stones (e.g., Green et  al. 2015; Ochyra et  al. 2008), together with the presence of permafrost, solifluction or ablation, significantly limiting the development of terrestrial communities (Convey et al. 2009). Biodivers Conserv1 3Specific Antarctic flora and fauna makes the food resources for potential hetero-trophic invaders very different from their habitat of origin. Therefore, trophic resources may be accessible only for organisms capable of changing their diet and feeding behav-ior. This may present an impenetrable barrier for heterotrophic monophagic species which reach the Maritime Antarctic. For example wood pests recorded in the Arctowski Station (Chwedorzewska et al. 2013; Osyczka et al. 2012). In Antarctica there are no woody plants (e.g., Convey 2010; Hughes and Convey 2014), therefore in the receiving habitat there are no food resources for these organisms. These species are also unable to complete their life cycle without access to wood and bark. All timber in Antarctic is of allochtonic origin, brought in for construction purposes, wooden crates and pallets used for cargo packaging, or driftwood impregnated by seawater (Chwedorzewska et al. 2013). Another example is the problem of accessibility to proper food resources for vagrant bird species, particularly passerines. Gryz et  al. (2015) observed that the Austral Negrito Lessonia rufahasis was unable to feed on the flightless invertebrates in Antarctica. The species’ characteristic feed-ing behavior, based on catching flying insects, was not successful in this case.Resource availability has a very high temporal variation, which may be a problem for alien terrestrial organisms. This is connected with the low primary production of palatable plants—potential fodder for grazers. The extended duration of snow cover hampers access to lichens and dead plant biomass. Similarly, the food base for predators is available mainly in the austral summer season during the breeding, molting and/or resting seasons of mari-time vertebrates (Ciaputa and Siciński 2006; Jabłoński 1986; Salwicka and Rakusa-Suszc-zewski 2002; Trivelpiece et  al. 1987a). Therefore, according to the fluctuating resource availability theory advanced by Davis et al. (2000), the invasibility of communities at Point Thomas Oasis may be low due to the low levels of unused resources available to an invader and the temporal variation. Nevertheless, this might change with climatic fluctuations, making unused resources available for potential invaders at some future point in time.Native biodiversity—low richness of autochthonous species in the Maritime AntarcticNative Antarctic terrestrial communities typically have low species richness and are thought to have low functional redundancy. At the higher taxonomic levels, many groups are missing altogether, no native pteridophytes occur in the Maritime Antarctic. Vascular plants are represented by only two species of flowering plants (e.g., Convey 2010; Hughes and Convey 2014). The poorly developed Antarctic tundra consists mostly of cryptogams. Major components of the terrestrial biota are lichens (294 species on KGI; Olech 2004) and mosses (63 species on KGI, Ochyra et al. 2008). Fauna of true terrestrial animals of the Antarctic region (sub-Antarctic and Antarctica) is limited to small invertebrates (some 520 species of soil animals, but likely underestimated) from the groups: Diptera (only two species), Acari, Collembola, Tardigrada, Nematoda and Rotifera (Houghton et al. 2016).Apart from the cetaceans, which are fully aquatic, all other Antarctic megafauna spe-cies depend on the terrestrial environment to reproduce (Forcada 2008). Species diversity is low and includes 53 species of marine birds (13 breed on KGI) and six species of pin-nipeds (five species on KGI; Salwicka and Rakusa-Suszczewski 2002). Most of those ani-mals form large breeding colonies and resting concentrations on shore which remain very patchy and strongly depend on accessibility to the shore (e.g., Shirihai 2008; Sierakowski et al. 2017; Trivelpiece et al. 1987a).Biodivers Conserv 1 3It is widely claimed that the more isolated oceanic islands should be less resistant to invasion than the less isolated ones, because endemic species of isolated oceanic islands are weak competitors (Caujape-Castells et  al. 2010, but see comments by Kueffer et  al. 2010). Hughes and Convey (2014) argue that the long history of evolutionary isolation of Antarctic biota is evidenced by high levels of endemism across most groups of organ-isms. In fact, the high percentage of endemics refer to the biota of lichens (151 endemic species—39% of biota of lichens of the Maritime and Continental Antarctic, Ochyra et al. 2008). Approximately 170 animal soil species are endemic (about 33% of terrestrial inver-tebrates fauna of the sub-Antarctic and Antarctic, e.g., Houghton et al. 2016). Almost or entirely all Nematoda fauna is endemic, despite the fact that generally nematode worms are highly capable of long-distance dispersal (Convey 2010). In contrast, the flora of bryo-phytes is characterized by a low level of endemism—no endemic taxa occur in the flora of liverworts, and the relatively rich flora of mosses contains only 6% strict Antarctic endem-ics (Ochyra et al. 2008).The correlation between native species richness and the invasibility of a habitat has been discussed by many authors (e.g., Kueffer et al. 2010; Thuiller et al. 2007). It has been shown that the relationship between species richness and ecosystem invasibility is scale-dependent (Kühn and Klotz 2007; Richardson and Pyšek 2006). However, it seems that the number of the native species, including endemic species, is less important for invasibility than, for example, the presence or absence of a species that may interact with the potential invader (Borges et al. 2006). Therefore, as stated by Crawley et al. (1999), the characteris-tics of the dominant native species may be more important for habitat invasibility than the overall species richness.Enemy release—low pressure of terrestrial consumers in AntarcticaThe trophic complexity of the Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems is thought to be generally simple and mostly relies on marine resources. The different trophic levels are represented by singular species or not represented at all (Convey 2010; Frenot et al. 2005). All verte-brates (marine birds and pinnipeds) rely on marine resources for food (Hughes and Convey 2014); there are no terrestrial herbivores in the Antarctic region (Olech et al. 2011). Preda-tors that could present pressure for alien terrestrial animals are primarily skuas Stercorarius spp. and the southern giant petrel Macronectes giganteus, which are intelligent generalists with a diverse diet and the ability to quickly change their food preferences (e.g., Carneiro et al. 2015; Malzof and Quintana 2008). The similar abundant and highly successful avian predator, the kelp gull Larus dominicanus, is characterized by its dietary breadth, wide-ranging foraging strategies, and acclimation to modified landscapes (Gallagher et al. 2015). Among the pinnipeds, the fur seal species Arctocephalus spp. could potentially present pressure for alien animals. Some incidents of predation on various birds species have been recorded in the Antarctic (e.g., Ciaputa and Siciński 2006; Visser et al. 2008).The absence of terrestrial mammalian herbivores (Olech et al. 2011) and predators may present an advantage for alien species under the enemy release hypothesis. This may pro-mote higher susceptibility of native biota to the introduction of any heterotrophic organ-isms, which may remain without control by predators (Frenot et al. 2005). This characteris-tic of Antarctic habitats leaves open ground for unobstructed development of any potential newcomer according to the enemy release hypothesis (Blossey 2011; Keane and Crawley 2002). Biodivers Conserv1 3Patchiness of habitat and open gaps—mosaic of microhabitats and low competition in the Maritime AntarcticAntarctic ice-free areas are a mosaic of microhabitats (see section Resource availability), clearly differentiated by abiotic features, e.g., water conditions, salinity and/or nutrient con-tent of substratum. This patchiness also shapes the distribution of microorganisms in Mari-time Antarctic, making the interactions involved more limited in space and different from species-rich environments (Bölter et al. 1997). Harsh environmental conditions impact the poor development of vegetation and loose vegetation cover (see Wilson et  al. 2007 and sections The possibilities of bioclimatic suitability and Native biodiversity in this article). This type of open habitat leaves potential for ecological niches to be filled by newcomers and presents the possibility for establishment of novel trophic functions in the ecosystem (Hughes and Convey 2014).Due to the severe environmental conditions native Antarctic biota is characterized by a predominant life history of poor competitive ability and vulnerability to invasion by more effective competitors (Convey 2010; Hughes and Convey 2014). On one hand, this relaxed competitive ability of indigenous organisms is promoted by the harsh environmental condi-tions in Antarctica, and on the other by the spatial isolation of the islands (Kühn and Klotz 2007), enhancing the high invasibility of this region. The underlying assumption is that an invading species will benefit in a community where it does not encounter intense competi-tion for resources (Alpert et al. 2000).System contextIn the case of spatially isolated habitats, the breaking of geographic barriers is of major importance for the system context (spatial and temporal influence arising outside the habi-tat that might be invaded; Foxcroft et al. 2011). The breaking of a geographic barrier has been mostly achieved through deliberate introduction and cultivation of economic (espe-cially ornamental) plants. This general principle is pertinent in the majority of oceanic island plant invasions (e.g., Keller et al. 2011; Kueffer et al. 2010). In contrast, the prop-agule pressure on Antarctic islands is mainly mediated through inadvertent introductions. Strict phytosanitary regulations are aimed at reducing the likelihood of the introduction of alien propagules by this vector (Chown et al. 2012a; Hughes and Convey 2014). Due to the strict spatial and ecological isolation of the Point Thomas Oasis (chapter Geographical barrier), humans are the only vector of alien propagule dispersal. This is true for long dis-tance transportation (transoceanic), as well as for local propagule dispersal within the Ant-arctic between islands and ice-free oases. Transport duration and conditions have to meet propagule survival requirements to enable their establishment in the target environment. The route and mode of transport are key aspects for the probability of invasion success.The natural fine scale vectors are wind and birds, including vagrant species (birds found far outside their expected range). There are several potential mechanisms by which vagrant individuals arrive in the Antarctic. They may have either drifted off course from their nor-mal migration routes by austral gales (e.g., Lazo and Yañez 1989), traveling on errant head-ings (e.g., Lees and Gilroy 2009), or may represent the vanguard of individuals pioneering new migration routes—“pseudo-vagrants” sensu Gilroy and Lees (Gilroy and Lees 2003; Korczak-Abshire et al. 2011a). They may be potential diaspore migration agents.Biodivers Conserv 1 3Migration pathways—limited transport capability in the Maritime AntarcticAntarctica has received a rapid increase in tourism over the last two decades (e.g., Chwedorzewska 2009; Chwedorzewska and Korczak 2010). Tourist airplane flights over the Antarctic continent started in the 1950s and were soon followed by cruises to the South Shetland Islands (Frenot et al. 2005). In comparison with other areas of the World (Hulme 2009), the intensity of these visits remains small. The main means of transport of alien species into Antarctica are tourist and expedition ships, despite the quarantine inspections and fumigation at cargo facilities (Houghton et al. 2016). The number of cruise ship visits at Arctowski Station during each of the last seven austral summers has ranged from 7 to 29, with 350 to even 5700 persons landing per season (Chwedorzewska et al. 2015, Fig. 2). Most tourists are from Europe, North America and Japan (Chwedorzewska 2009). Above all, ships (touristic, research, fishing and military vessels) can be accompanied by vagrant birds (Gryz et  al. 2015; Korczak-Abshire et  al. 2011b), capable of bringing alien prop-agules to the Antarctic. Ship—assisting vagrant birds transported to South Shetland Islands have been reported by Couve and Vidal (2003) and Shirihai (2008).The abundance of propagules of alien species was found to be pathway dependent (Houghton et al. 2016). The majority of tourist ships depart from Ushuaia or Punta Are-nas and participate in multi-site tours. The sequence of sites visited over the short time period is from warmer areas of higher biodiversity (Tierra del Fuego and sub-Antarctic islands) to the cooler highly pristine sites in Maritime Antarctica and the Antarctic con-tinent (Chwedorzewska 2009). For most ships, the Polish Station is the first place visited after departure from South America. Furthermore, the same ships commonly visit high-latitude polar regions in the Northern Hemisphere within 6 months of departing for Ant-arctica (Chwedorzewska and Korczak 2010). Also the supply ship of the Polish Antarctic Station operates as a tourist ship in the Arctic during the boreal summer (Chwedorzewska 2009). This can increase the probability of introduction of non-native species with pre-adaptations to survive in polar conditions.Fig. 2  Tourists visiting Arctowski Station in the austral summer. Photo by M. Wódkiewicz Biodivers Conserv1 3Despite the huge number of landing people, tourism seems to contribute only a minor proportion of alien propagule traffic. The main reasons are strict phytosanitary regulations (www.iaato .org) and the short visit time—tourists are responsible for only 5% of total per-son days spent on land in Antarctica (Jabour 2009). In contrast the equipment and clothes of station personnel do not undergo such strict inspection. Station staff constitute a smaller group of people visiting the Antarctic (Frenot et al. 2005), however their stay is consid-erably longer and therefore creates a greater impact on the environment (e.g., Lee and Chown 2009a, b). It is estimated that about 75 Antarctic research stations are inhabited by around 4000 employees in austral summer while approximately 1000 people stay for the winter (Hughes and Convey 2014). In the last seven seasons the number of expeditioners working at Arctowski Station has ranged from 6 to 8 wintering persons (staying at the sta-tion at least 12 months) and 5–33 persons staying only for the austral summer (from 2 to 6 months, Arctowski Station logbook).For the Polish Antarctic Station the main means of transportation is by ship and heli-copter. Air transportation is not frequent and of marginal importance for Arctowski Station (small number of passengers and volume of cargo). While the transport of alien animals into Antarctica by air has been reported in literature (Frenot et al. 2005), the probability of an invasion mediated by air traffic in Point Thomas Oasis still seems to be low.Functional connectivity—factors enabling the survival of alien propagules during transport to Point Thomas OasisThe main introduction routes are associated with polar station provisioning. Alien organ-isms might be accidentally transported on packaging materials, vehicles, scientific equipment, construction materials. Fresh food products and staff personal items includ-ing clothes, boots and luggage all have the increased probability of propagule carryover (Chwedorzewska et al. 2013; Chown et al. 2012b; Lityńska-Zając et al. 2012). The Polish Station is usually provisioned once a year, with small amounts of fresh products resup-plied from South America several times during the summer season. The majority of cargo destined to Arctowski Station originates in Poland, but some fresh fruit, vegetables and eggs are supplied from Argentina. The produce are transported at 4 °C for approximately 40 days from Poland and 7 days from Argentina. These conditions may prolong the longev-ity of a wide spectrum of living organisms. The rest of the cargo (on average 30 tonnes per year), excluding frozen items, are kept in the ship’s hold, where conditions may also pro-mote survival of many propagules (Chwedorzewska et al. 2013).Transportation conditions may on the other hand limit the successful arrival of prop-agules to the target environment. In the case of animals with a short life cycle, long dura-tion transport presents a major barrier as the life of some invertebrates is too short to sur-vive the passage to King George Island where they could potentially close their life cycle (Chwedorzewska et al. 2013).Propagule pressure—diversity of propagules reaching Point Thomas OasisDue to the distinct spatial isolation of Antarctica, direct observations of alien propagule migration to the Polish Antarctic Station were possible. Due to strict control of potential vectors (compare sections Geographical barrier and Migration pathways) this presents a unique possibility to perform a direct study of propagule pressure.Biodivers Conserv 1 3Altogether 103 alien species were found to arrive to Point Thomas Oasis (Electronic Supplementary Material A1). During three summer seasons, 148 generative diaspores belonging to 45 species of flowering plants alien to the Maritime Antarctic were found on personnel field clothing, gear and equipment (Lityńska-Zając et  al. 2012). Juncus bufo-nius has not been physically observed in Antarctica, but its diaspores capable of germina-tion were found in soil samples collected in the vicinity of Arctowski Station (Cuba-Díaz et  al. 2013). A total of 45 specimens of non-indigenous lichens belonging to 24 species alien to the Antarctic biota were found on the cargo of one of the expeditions (mostly on wooden pallets and cases; Osyczka 2010). Also nine species of macrofungi were discov-ered on timber brought for one of the expeditions (Osyczka et al. 2012). In the cargo of three expeditions, altogether 271 live specimens of 24 species of invertebrates were found, mostly among the fresh fruits and vegetables (Chwedorzewska et al. 2013). Additionally, four specimens of insects belonging to two species were noted on timber materials for one of the expeditions (Osyczka et al. 2012). Only a Barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) individual observed in Point Thomas Oasis (Korczak-Abshire et al. 2011b) could be considered as an alien vertebrate species transported to Antarctica by a human vector as individuals of this species have been observed on vessels visiting Antarctica (e.g., Shirihai 2008; Couve and Vidal 2003; Joseph Charles Abshire, the captain of RV Laurence M. Gould, also observed a juvenile Barn swallow on board off shore of Livingston Island in South Shetlands archi-pelago on 6th Nov 2011).The relatively large propagule pressure in Antarctica, however unexpected it may seem at first, has also been confirmed by other authors (Hughes and Pertierra 2016; Houghton et al. 2016 and literature cited therein). Around 10 alien plant species have survived the Antarctic environmental conditions (sometimes their identification was ambiguous; Hughes and Pertierra 2016). Some alien species function only in artificial manmade habi-tats and are not observed in the outside environment, such as Trichocera maculipennis and Lycoriella ingenua (Hughes et al. 2005; Houghton et al. 2016; Hughes and Pertierra 2016) or populations of Drosophila melanogaster and Ctenosciara hyalipennis found almost every year in the vegetable warehouse at Arctowski Station (Chwedorzewska et al. 2013). All these findings indirectly confirm propagule pressure. Despite the relatively high spe-cies diversity of propagules reaching Arctowski Station (Electronic Supplementary Mate-rial A1) only one species (Poa annua) has penetrated the survival (Olech 1996), reproduc-tion (Wódkiewicz et al. 2013), as well as dispersal and environmental barriers (Olech and Chwedorzewska 2011; Galera et al. 2017).Spatial and temporal patterns of propagule arrival—potential invasion hotspots associated with human occupied sites in Antarctic stationsIn the context of the framework, it has been proposed that the spatial arrangement of hab-itats subject to different kinds and levels of anthropopressure (e.g., areas strongly trans-formed by man vs. relatively undisturbed natural habitats) “provides essential context that will influence the functional connectivity and transfer of propagules between patches” (Foxcroft et al. 2011). Simberloff (2009) also indicates that the spatial and temporal pat-terns of propagule arrival are an important component. It is typical that the areas of highest human-generated disturbance neighbor logistics cargo hubs (e.g., railway areas—Brandes 1983, 2005; Wiłkomirski et al. 2012; inland ports—Brandes 1989; airports and seaports—Tatem et al. 2006). A similar phenomenon can be observed in the Antarctic. Biodivers Conserv1 3Human activities in the Antarctic are concentrated mainly in small, scattered, ice-free coastal zones. Most of the research stations are also located at these coastal areas which are at the same time favorable to development of biological communities (e.g., Hughes and Convey 2014; Hughes et al. 2011). Moreover, the sites most likely visited by tourists coincide with the locations of most scientific bases and high wildlife concentration. Due to the interaction of the comparatively favorable microclimate and expanding human inter-est in the vicinity of research stations, the likelihood of encroachment by alien organisms increases. Areas near polar research stations generally receive frequent visits (station staff and some of the stations also tourists). The consequences may be visible immediately, but are often cumulative and may only become apparent over a longer time (Chwedorzewska and Korczak 2010). The construction and utilization of the Antarctic research station infra-structure results in irreversible environmental impacts (Hughes and Convey 2014; Frenot et al. 2005). Thus, all known introductions of terrestrial alien species have been found in the vicinity of the research stations (Hughes and Worland 2010; Hughes et al. 2012; Olech 1996). The majority of activities associated with the functioning of the stations are per-formed during the austral summer. This presents a high probability of alien propagules reaching potentially invasible sites and become established, in comparison with the winter season when the area is covered by snow and conditions disable life development.Tourists are attracted mainly to sites of high/medium biological diversity (Frenot et al. 2005 and literature cited therein), and their visits concentrate on small coastal areas rather than on inland ice (Bölter and Stonehouse 2002). The standard pattern of visits during the 1980s and 1990s was simply to land on beaches and observe any immediately accessible wildlife, but the options now include extensive walks, kayaking, skiing, and even a mara-thon (see www.marat honto ur.com). Currently, over 30,000 ship-based tourists visit the Antarctic region each year (Chown et al. 2012b), making use of the over 150 landing sites. While some locations receive only a few visits per decade, the most popular may be visited three times weekly throughout the summer season (even 430 landings per site, see iaato.org).Arctowski Station is one of the most attractive Antarctic research stations for tourists. Here, visitors have good access to such attractions as a penguin rookery, gathering places of pinnipeds, relics of the whaling industry (e.g., harpoons, whale bones), valuable plant communities, and a visit to the main station building (Zwolicki et al. 2015).Global change—rapid climate change on King George IslandEarlier studies indicated that the climate of Antarctica is closely linked with other parts of the global climate system (Summerhayes 2009; Turner et al. 2014). However recently Turner et  al. (2016) contradicted these findings stating that the local changes “are not primarily associated with the drivers of global temperature change but, rather, reflect the extreme natural internal variability of the regional atmospheric circulation”. Numerous authors showed that the climatic conditions of the Antarctic Peninsula region show the largest warming trend in the whole Antarctic (e.g., Nielsen and Wall 2013; Turner 2009; Turner et al. 2014). Data from 1948 to 2011 from nine meteorological stations located on KGI and on Deception Island, 120 km away from KGI (Kejna et  al. 2013) indicate that an increase in air temperature has occurred, reaching 0.19  °C/10  years. In summer, the warming was more than twice as high as in wintertime (Kejna et al. 2013). However the latest data of Braun et  al. (2017) indicate that the summer warming trend that persisted on KGI until the end of 20st century has collapsed. Data from the last years indicate that Biodivers Conserv 1 3the climate in the Antarctic Peninsula region is more variable in space and time than pre-viously expected (Turner et al. 2016; Braun et al. 2017; Sancho et al. 2017). Such rapid changes of weather conditions may disturb the ecosystem balance what may increase its susceptibility to invasions.In contrast to changes in mean monthly air temperature, the precipitation level on KGI has only changed minimally (Braun et al. 2017). In the Maritime Antarctic, summer pre-cipitation increasingly occurs as rain rather than snow (Chwedorzewska 2009). This increases liquid water availability during the vegetation season. The water availability is still increased by seasonal snow and glacial melt (Turner 2009; Turner et al. 2014). The melting of ice banks not only increases water resources but also uncovers large areas from under the ice cover (Chwedorzewska 2009). The most spectacular changes in polar regions are colonization and primary succession on glacier forefields recently denuded of ice (e.g., Chwedorzewska 2009; Olech et al. 2011). The process of climate warming in this region (even if local and temporal) will enable the survival and spread of alien species once intro-duced (e.g., Frenot et al. 2005; Olech and Chwedorzewska 2011) should they possess the strategy of soil seed bank formation. This poses the risk that Antarctic taxa, well adapted to cold environments, will come eventually under pressure and may be pushed out of their natural environments by newcomers (Chwedorzewska 2009; Convey 2003; Frenot et  al. 2005; Hughes and Convey 2014). If climate change follows a warming trend, the conse-quences may be expected to include increased diversity, biomass and trophic complexity, all of which contribute to the development of a more complex terrestrial ecosystem struc-ture (Convey 2006). Climate warming may alter the natural distribution limits for species or even whole communities (Convey 2003; Convey and Lewis Smith 1993). Consequences at ecosystem level may be wide-ranging, rather than being restricted to just the directly impacted taxa (Chwedorzewska 2008; Olech 1996).Providing a further climate warming the related factors, such as altered depth and extent of snow cover, permafrost melt, recession of glaciers, freeze–thaw cycles, and potential increase in the frequency and magnitude of extreme events, may influence plant and ani-mal communities (see overview by Nielsen and Wall 2013). For example the white-rumped sandpiper Calidris fuscicollis with only sporadic visits has become more frequent on KGI and can be the first example of a natural species range shift (Korczak-Abshire et al. 2011a; Trivelpiece et al. 1987b). This trend could be the result of short term and longer term vari-ations in weather and climate conditions during the austral spring and summer months, when this species is observed. In addition however, a higher air temperature, which is a result of predominant northerly winds bringing relatively warm and moist air, would prob-ably result in habitats more suitable for settlement and better food resources that would allow the birds to persist or survive. Such precedent has already taken place in Point Thomas Oasis area. Individuals of a non-native bird species Calidris fuscicollis have been seen feeding on accumulations of macroalgae remains after storms and exposed seaweed flora during warmer summer seasons (Korczak-Abshire et al. 2011a).The ozone hole has increased the penetration of UV-B radiation in Antarctica to levels similar as in moderate climate zone (Frenot et al. 2005; Robinson et al. 2003). The UV-B radiation varies throughout the year with elevated levels coinciding with the time of plant emergence from winter dormancy and melting of the protective snow cover (Robinson et al. 2003). While alien species that come from other climatic zones may be preadapted to higher UV-B levels, native Antarctic organisms may have had relatively little time for evo-lutionary adjustment and acclimation to new conditions (Robinson et al. 2003). However some Antarctic mosses have been found to quickly deploy sufficient UV protection (News-ham et al. 2002; Green et al. 2005). Negative effects of UV-B can be reduced by various  Biodivers Conserv1 3defense mechanisms (Robinson et al. 2003; Turnbull et al. 2009). However, their launch is associated with the additional costs, which may prove to be too large, especially for organ-isms living at the physiological limits of survival.The potential changes in species distribution due to climatic changes have been addressed by many authors (Thuiller et  al. 2007; in city environment—e.g., Neil and Wu 2006; Sukopp and Wurzel 2003, and literature cited therein). However, the patterns observed in the Arctic or alpine zones representing a spatial continuum within a continent (Nielsen and Wall 2013), may not apply to the Maritime Antarctic due to a lack in spatial connectivity between regions differing in climatic conditions.Residence time—low probability of survival through the lag phase in the AntarcticIn other regions under favorable conditions a long residence time is one of the most cited factors preceding a successful invasion (Houghton et al. 2016; Richardson and Pyšek 2006; Wilson et al. 2007) and has almost exclusively been studied post factum. In contrast, due to harsh weather conditions in the Maritime Antarctic, the factors promoting plant growth are met for only a short time during the year. Moreover, in some years they may not be reached at all. This would induce the residence time to be extended in comparison with the temperate regions. Also the stochastic occurrence of extreme conditions and any possi-ble human caused disturbance of the newly established population of an alien species may decrease the probability of alien species survival. These factors may break the residence time required for a species to accomplish a successful invasion. A good example is the dis-persal of P. annua on Deception Island interrupted by a volcanic eruption (Chwedorzewska et al. 2015).Species invasivenessThe characteristic of invasive species has already been analyzed by many authors (Keller et al. 2011; Kueffer et al. 2010; Moles et al. 2008; Pyšek and Richardson 2007). Treating functional traits of a potential invaders as a prerequisite for successful invasion is often criticized. During the last few years a debate has focused on genetic diversity and phe-notypic plasticity in alien populations of invasive species (Colautti et al. 2017; Espeland 2013). These phenomena restrict the possibility to fully study species invasiveness only to post factum situations—during an ongoing invasion. The assessment of risk associated with alien organisms while they are still in the lag time and before they enter the phase of expansion is therefore highly limited.In the case of invasions in Antarctica local climatic conditions may favor the invasion of poikilothermic and poikilohydric organisms, with a broad capacity to tolerate extreme conditions, notably low and rapidly fluctuating temperatures and tissue water content. Only a few flowering plants possess such traits. The transplantation experiments showed that Antarctic conditions prevent the survival and spread of intentionally introduced terrestrial plants. It is worth highlighting that these experiments resulted in accidental introduction of P. pratensis at Cierva Point (Danco Coast, Antarctic Peninsula; Pertierra et al. 2017).A successful invasion is more probable when conditions in the target community par-allel those in the native range of the invader. This especially pertains to similar climatic zones. Therefore, Arctic and alpine species originating from the coldest parts of the globe Biodivers Conserv 1 3may be especially fit for the particularly harsh Antarctic conditions. Arctic and alpine organisms may possess the necessary life history features making them resistant to unfa-vorable abiotic conditions, and similarly to Antarctic organisms may be of low competi-tive ability. However the probability of unintended exchange of propagules between these areas is extremely low (except potentially by transport in a tourist vessel operating both in the Arctic and Antarctic). This further diminishes the probability of invasion. The lack of any Arctic or alpine species in a list of 15 worst invasive alien plants in broader Antarctic (McGeoch et al. 2015) seems to confirm this hypothesis.Edaphic conditions prevailing in the Antarctic may favor the spread of species tolerating high soil salinity and unfavorable mechanic properties. This hypothesis has been confirmed under Maritime Antarctic conditions. For example, the only successful alien flowering plant P. annua exhibits a high tolerance to saline, poorly aerated, and compacted soils (e.g., Chwedorzewska et al. 2015; Giełwanowska et al. 2011). A population of this species exist-ing at Point Thomas Oasis for over 30 years displays specific traits that enabled its success-ful invasion (Wódkiewicz et  al. 2014, 2018; Galera et  al. 2015, 2017). High phenotypic plasticity of this species may be a key driving factor.ConclusionsOur work should be seen not as a direct comparison of South African (Foxcroft et al. 2011; Vardien et al. 2012) and Antarctic systems. The expanded conceptual framework opens up wider possibilities in analyzing invasions taking place in different systems. In such a way we may be able to refine our ideas instead of multiplying the number “disposable” tools such as theoretical frameworks. Moreover, the expanded conceptual framework used in this study enables an assessment of the threat of alien organisms belonging to different taxa. We have invoked additional mechanisms specific to the Antarctic region. However, we did not fully address one element of expanded framework—species invasiveness (Fig. 1), due to the goal of predicting invasions of undefined organisms, that is not belonging to a spe-cific taxa.The Arctowski Station system presented a unique opportunity to analyze relationships between system context and specific characteristics of the Antarctic habitat influencing the susceptibility of the region to invasion. The isolation and simple trophic complexity of the Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems, the legal obligation to enforce control over Polar Station functioning, relatively low penetration of Point Thomas Oasis by tourists, have all ena-bled a detailed analysis of factors influencing the probability of biological invasion of this area. The most important factors presenting a barrier to the encroachment of alien species are the harsh environmental conditions and high isolation of Antarctica. The pressure of autochtonous competitors and consumers may be seen as a less obstructive factor for the establishment of alien organisms.Our analysis indicates that Antarctica is threatened by invasions due to the complexity of factors belonging to the system context (Fig. 1). It is almost impossible to stop climate changes from increasing the habitat susceptibility of this region. Therefore, an effective way of preventing biological invasions in Antarctica seems to lie in reducing propagule pressure and eliminating alien populations as early as possible.Acknowledgements This work was supported by The National Science Centre by a Grant No 218361 (2013/09/B/NZ8/03293).

Antarctic climate-diversity-invasion hypothesis,404026247,"Hull fouling marine invasive species pose a very low, but plausible, risk of introduction to East Antarctica in climate change scenarios",10.1111/ddi.13246,"Holland, Oakes, Shaw, Justine, Stark, Jonathan S., Wilson, Kerrie A.",2021,"Aims: To identify potential hull fouling marine invasive species that could survive in East Antarctica presently and in the future. Location: Australia's Antarctic continental stations: Davis, Mawson and Casey, East Antarctica; and subantarctic islands: Macquarie Island and Heard and McDonald Islands. Methods: Our study uses a novel machine-learning algorithm to predict which currently known hull fouling MIS could survive in shallow benthic ecosystems adjacent to Australian Antarctic research stations and subantarctic islands, where ship traffic is present. We used gradient boosted machine learning (XGBoost) with four important environmental variables (sea surface temperature, salinity, nitrate and pH) to develop models of suitable environments for each potentially invasive species. We then used these models to determine if any of Australia's three Antarctic research stations and two subantarctic islands could be environmentally suitable for MIS now and under two future climate scenarios. Results: Most of the species were predicted to be unable to survive at any location between now and the end of this century; however, four species were identified as potential current threats and five as threats under future climate change. Asterias amurensis was identified as a potential threat to all locations. Main conclusions: This study suggests that the risks are very low, but plausible, that known hull fouling species could survive in the shallow benthic habitats near Australia's East Antarctica locations and suggest a precautionary approach is needed by way of surveillance and monitoring in this region, particularly if propagule pressure increases. While some species could survive as adults in the region, their ability to reach these locations and undergo successful reproduction is considered unlikely based on current knowledge.</p",,Contribution to Journal,"climate change, East Antarctica, gradient boosting, hull fouling, invasion biology, machine learning, Northern Pacific sea star, ports, subantarctic, XGBoost",,Wiley-Blackwell Publishing Ltd
Antarctic climate-diversity-invasion hypothesis,186546685,Antarctica’s ecological isolation will be broken by storm-driven dispersal and warming,,"Fraser, Ceridwen I., Morrison, Adele K., Hogg, Andrew Mc C., Macaya, Erasmo C., van Sebille, Erik, Ryan, Peter G., Padovan, Amanda, Jack, Cameron, Valdivia, Nelson, Waters, Jonathan M.",2018,"Antarctica has long been considered biologically isolated1. Global warming will make parts of Antarctica more habitable for invasive taxa, yet presumed barriers to dispersal—especially the Southern Ocean’s strong, circumpolar winds, ocean currents and fronts—have been thought to protect the region from non-anthropogenic colonizations from the north1,2. We combine molecular and oceanographic tools to directly test for biological dispersal across the Southern Ocean. Genomic analyses reveal that rafting keystone kelps recently travelled >20,000 km and crossed several ocean-front ‘barriers’ to reach Antarctica from mid-latitude source populations. High-resolution ocean circulation models, incorporating both mesoscale eddies and wave-driven Stokes drift, indicate that such Antarctic incursions are remarkably frequent and rapid. Our results demonstrate that storm-forced surface waves and ocean eddies can dramatically enhance oceanographic connectivity for drift particles in surface layers, and show that Antarctica is not biologically isolated. We infer that Antarctica’s long-standing ecological differences have been the result of environmental extremes that have precluded the establishment of temperate-adapted taxa, but that such taxa nonetheless frequently disperse to the region. Global warming thus has the potential to allow the establishment of diverse new species—including keystone kelps that would drastically alter ecosystem dynamics—even without anthropogenic introductions",,Letter,"Taverne, Environmental Science (miscellaneous), Social Sciences (miscellaneous)",,
Antarctic climate-diversity-invasion hypothesis,481092456,Antarctica as an evolutionary arena during the Cenozoic global cooling,10.1073/pnas.2108886118,"Condamine, Fabien L., Kergoat, Gael, J.",2021,"International audienceIt is striking to observe that species richness is not evenly distributed across the surface of the planet. Current species diversity indeed decreases toward the poles, with Antarctica for instance being depauperate compared to tropical regions. This ubiquitous pattern has long attracted the attention of naturalists and more recently of evolutionary biologists and paleontologists to understand why species diversity peaks at the equator. However, it remains poorly understood how polar biodiversity originated and diversified. Antarctica is currently defined as three large biogeographic regions: the Maritime Antarctic, the sub-Antarctic, and the Continental Antarctic. The Maritime Antarctic region is largely separated from the rest of the world’s oceans due to the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), differences in temperature along the Antarctic Polar Front (APF), and the presence of a deep sea surrounding the Antarctic shelf (1). The sub-Antarctic region consists of dozens of islands contained within the APF, generally characterized by the presence of tundra (absent from the Continental Antarctic) and fellfield habitats. As for the Continental Antarctic region, it is mostly uninhabitable, with less than 0.5% of its surface being ice-free.

This paradigm, as well as incorporating a new and much longer timescale in which to consider the evolution and adaptation of Antarctic terrestrial biota, opens important new cross-disciplinary linkages with geologists and glaciologists seeking to unravel the history of the continent itself. This unique biota now faces the twin challenges of responding to the complex processes of climate change facing some parts of the continent, and the direct impacts associated with human occupation and activity. In many instances, this biota is likely to benefit, initially at least, from the current environmental changes, and there is an expectation of increased production, biomass, population size, community complexity, and colonisation.

Rapid changes in three major environmental variables have occurred in the Antarctic region during the last decades. In the short term terrestrial biota are likely to benefit from reduced environmental stresses, but in the long run the colonization of the region by lower latitude species with greater competi− tive ability will become increasingly important and can lead to large−scale changes in biologi− cal composition and trophic complexity in some existing Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems. Moreover, the recent dynamic climate changes combined with human activities in the Antarc− tic region might modify the status of several alien species which have hitherto been consid− ered transient or persistent and could, therefore, become naturalized and threaten the native communities on a larger scale than today, or influence the status of naturalized species.

The Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Arc provide a gradient from oceanic cool temperate to frigid continental desert conditions, giving a natural model of climate change predictions. Biota are limited by the twin environmental factors of low temperature and lack of water, while also facing changes in the timing of UV-B maxima, associated with the spring ozone hole. Biological changes consistent with predictions from climate amelioration are visible in the form of expansions in range and local population numbers amongst elements of the flora. Field manipulations demonstrate (i) potential for massive species and community responses to climate amelioration, (ii) the importance of existing soil propagule banks, and (iii) biochemical responses to changing radiation environments. Antarctic species possess considerable resistance/resilience and response flexibility to a range of environmental stresses. Wide environmental variability in Antarctic terrestrial habitats also means that predicted levels of change often fall well within the range already experienced. Thus, climate amelioration may generate positive responses from resident biota, at least while they remain protected through isolation from colonization by more effective competitors.

The ACC is formed where cold seawaters sink beneath the northerly warmer waters. It acts as a biological barrier: organisms are not able to cross it because of the deeply different physicochemical properties of seawaters. Thus, only large animals can cross it (cetaceans, seabirds). The atmosphere over the southern hemisphere shows also a polar front where the Ferrell Cell (mid-latitude air circulation) meets the polar cell: in the former, the air flows toward the poles and eastward near the surface and equatorially and westerly at higher altitudes. At the front, air rises and travels towards the pole, where it sinks forming the polar highs. The Antarctic continent and the Southern Ocean are almost isolated from the other oceans and air masses and thus the turnover is very low. These geographical and air/ocean circulation features make this region of the planet difficult to be reached by persistent organic pollutants (POPs).

Antarctic climate-diversity-invasion hypothesis,584414746,Climate change and invasion impacts in the sub-Antarctic,10.5281/zenodo.4751646,"Treasure, Ann",2012,"Climate change and biological invasions are major threats to biodiversity. In particular, these threats are predicted to influence terrestrial systems in the sub-Antarctic, where significant ecosystem responses to both have already been seen. In this thesis, the  sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Island group is used as a model system in which to investigate key questions relating to climate change and invasive species impacts. The island group comprises two islands, Marion (MI) and Prince Edward (PEI), both of which are experiencing rapid warming, yet have different invasive assemblages and in consequence are experiencing different impacts.  Variation in the patterns of invasive species richness and abundance and their underlying causes are matters of considerable ecological and conservation significance. While an increase in thermal energy availability typically results in an increase in species richness, the mechanisms underlying these patterns are poorly understood. In Chapter 2 of this thesis, these relationships are explored for springtails, an important component of the soil fauna on Marion Island. Energy explains a large amount of the spatial variation in indigenous and invasive springtail species richness. Disturbance thresholds and stressful temperatures are more important than increased population sizes in determining this variation in species richness. As both indigenous and invasive springtail species richness and abundance are strongly related to temperature, a warming climate could have  far-reaching consequences for these organisms. In particular, invasive species are predicted to be at an advantage relative to indigenous species under warming conditions.  One species where this seems especially likely, given its physiological responses to experimental warming and drying, is the large invasive tomocerid, Pogonognathellus flavescens. Determining whether this will be the case depends on understanding the factors underlying its range limits and abundance structure. Moreover, few studies have sought to distinguish the causal basis of abundance structure and range limits, particularly for invasive species. Thus, in Chapter 3, local microclimate variables and physiological tolerances of the invasive springtail, P. flavescens (a habitat generalist), are examined. The results suggest that the species should be widely distributed across a range of habitats on MI. However, the springtail is restricted to indigenous Poa cookii tussock grassland habitats in the southeast. The current range limits are set by dispersal limitation (i.e. contingent absences) whilst abundance structure is a function of variation in soil substrate quality. However, over time, the widening distribution of P. cookii, as a consequence of a major management intervention (the eradication of feral cats), may enable P. flavescens to colonise all suitable areas.  In Chapter 4, the focus changes to what has been considered the third major response to climate change, along with range and phenological responses - changing animal body sizes. Body size is one of the most significant and obvious features of animals and is of considerable ecological and physiological importance. A prediction of the temperature-size rule (TSR) is that with warming, body size of the weevil species on both MI and PEI should decline. However, predation by mice of the weevils on MI should fundamentally affect the pattern of such change, causing it to differ from neighbouring PEI, indicating synergistic impacts between climate change and invasions. Analysis of a 24-year data set indicates a decline in the body size of all weevil species on PEI with increasing temperature. However, on MI, a negative relationship between mean annual temperature and body size is found only for Palirhoeus eatoni, a species not eaten by mice. A possible explanation for the positive relationships found for the other species could be due to higher metabolic demands imposed on mice in colder years than in warmer ones. Any increase in predation coupled with a preference for larger sizes, which the mice clearly show, would lead to a decline in the mean size of the weevil species. Due to the relationship between body size and metabolic rate and the importance of the weevils in the islands' food webs, changes to the body size of these organisms could have significant consequences for the island ecosystems' functioning.  The thermal environment experienced by organisms also has a direct effect on survival, growth and reproduction. The physiological response of organisms to rapidly changing climates is therefore a primary concern. Organisms may respond to variable environmental conditions through phenotypic plasticity as well as behaviour. Chapter 5 of this thesis shows that of the weevil species and populations investigated on MI, most display phenotypic plasticity, the form of which is in keeping with the 'Hotter is Better' hypothesis. This could be due to rare extreme temperature events and the advantage for the performance curves to incorporate high temperatures experienced in the environment. Mismatches between thermal optima and preferred temperatures displayed by all species could mean that these weevils are well equipped to cope with warming conditions on MI unless the prediction of an increase of rare extreme events such as extreme temperatures is realised.  Rapidly changing climates and an increase in the introduction of non-indigenous species are issues of major conservation concern. This has increased the significance of studies on the impacts of these threats. However, this thesis shows that to understand such processes, it is essential that an integration of disciplines be undertaken. This thesis thus adopts a multidisciplinary approach and highlights key issues associated with both climate change and biological invasions. The patterns and predictions of species and community responses to these environmental changes are complex. Moreover, predicting such responses is likely to be problematic, especially as multiple factors will change concurrently and how these factors might change is unclear. This highlights the importance of long-term records for understanding organism responses to such changes. Furthermore, impacts on indigenous species are likely to be exacerbated by the predicted increase in the rate of introductions with climate change. This makes the case for preventing the dispersal of invasive species to new areas all the more important.To assess the impacts of climate change and invasive species in the sub-Antarcti",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/other, dataset","species-energy relationships, thermal biology, body size, abundance structure, Climate change, invasive species, sub-Antarctic, Marion Island, PhD",,

To our eyes, the environment appears harsh but, even though terrestrial biological diversity is restricted, a wide range of life is present and, locally, thrives. In the Antarctic, unusually, environments exist in which physical characteristics are dominant and overcome biological considerations. These are at the extreme ends of the ranges of many characteristics (temperature, snow, ice and solar radiation) found across environments globally. However, the Antarctic is also a large continent, comparable in area to continental Europe, and further surrounded by the cold Southern Ocean, within which lie a ring of subantarctic islands. Together, these islands and the continent give a natural environmental gradient with which to study the biological impacts of climate variables. Antarctica is also a focus for studies of responses to regional and global change (eg Bergstrom and Chown 1999, Convey 2001, 2003, Robinson et al. 2003).

Analyses of molecular genetics data are consistent with the diversity and distribution of marine and terrestrial taxa having been strongly influenced by geological and climatic cooling events over the last 70 Myr. Such events have resulted in vicariance driven by continental drift and thermal isolation of the Antarctic, and in pulses of species range contraction into refugia and subsequent expansion and secondary contact of genetically distinct populations or sister species during cycles of glaciation. Limited habitat availability has played a major role in structuring populations of species both in the past and in the present day. For these reasons, despite the apparent simplicity or homogeneity of Antarctic terrestrial and marine environments, populations of species are often geographically structured into genetically distinct lineages.

This review provides an overview of the most recent findings on how biotic communities in terrestrial ecosystems of the Antarctic Peninsula Region (APR) are responding and will likely respond to further environmental changes and direct anthropogenic impacts. Knowledge gained from studies on relatively simple terrestrial ecosystems could be very useful in predicting what may happen in much more complex ecosystems in regions with less extreme temperature changes. The rapid warming of the APR has led to the retreat of glaciers, the loss of snow and permafrost and the increase of ice-free areas, with a consequent enhancement of soil-forming processes, biotic communities, and food web complexity. However, most human activity is concentrated in APR coastal ice-free areas and poses many threats to terrestrial ecosystems such as environmental pollution or disturbances to soil communities and wildlife.

Here, we aim to: (a) investigate the local effect of environmental and anthropogenic factors on alien plant invasion in sub-Antarctic islands; and (b) explore whether and how functional traits affect alien species dependence on anthropogenic factors in these environments. Location. Possession Island, Crozet archipelago (French sub-Antarctic islands). Methods. Single-species distribution models were used to explore the effect of high-resolution topoclimatic and human-related variables on the occurrence of six alien plants colonizing French sub-Antarctic islands. Furthermore, plant responses to human-related variables and the effect of those variables in interaction with plant traits were analysed by means of a multi-species distribution model. This allowed identifying functional features mediating the influence of human activities on the occurrence probability of alien plant species. Results. We observed two main invasion patterns: (a) species predicted to occur close to the introduction sites, whose occurrence probability appeared to be strongly affected by anthropogenic factors; and (b) species predicted to occur nearly everywhere on Possession Island, except in areas featuring particularly harsh climatic conditions. Differences in the influence of human-related variables on the occurrence of the alien species were mostly related to their life history, plant height and residence time, with perennial and low-statured species introduced earlier appearing less dependent on human-induced dispersal and disturbance. Conclusions. We conclude that both topoclimatic and anthropogenic factors affect plant invasion on sub-Antarctic islands. Specifically, species predicted to occur close to their introduction sites appear much more dependent on human presence and activity, potentially due to the lack of key functional traits allowing them to spread successfully across Possession Island under the harsh sub-Antarctic climate. Yet, particularly severe abiotic conditions are a major constraint which equally limits the occurrence of all alien plants, irrespective of their dependence on anthropogenic factors",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/article, Journal articles","[SDV.BID]Life Sciences [q-bio]/Biodiversity, [SDV.EE]Life Sciences [q-bio]/Ecology, environment, [SDE.MCG]Environmental Sciences/Global Changes, [SDE.BE]Environmental Sciences/Biodiversity and Ecology",,'Wiley'

However, this may be due to an absence of information on impacts, including changing species occupancy and forecast occupancy, rather than lack of impact per se. Here we use the plant invaders on the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands (PEIs) and spatially explicit modeling of presence–absence survey data to demonstrate that the geographic extent of many invasives is increasing and is forecast to lead to occupancy of >60% of the islands’ surface area by 2060, with ongoing climate change. In keeping with theory, proximity to human activity, neighboring populations (i.e. propagule pressure) and residence time, along with more minor contributors such as elevation, explain >50% of the variation in the occupancy of each of the six main invasive species on the islands. Human disturbance and changing climates seem to have led to recent increases in the rate of range expansion. Our results suggest that impacts of island plant invaders may be more significant than previously estimated, largely owing to prior data deficiency.

Traditionally, continental isolation has been considered to restrict the arrival of new species and extreme cold to limit the survival of successful immigrants. However, recent biogeographical evidence suggests that water may play a primary role: clear correlations exist between moisture availability and the distribution and abundance of organisms on the vertical, horizontal, and temporal scales. At the continental scale there is a close relationship between substratum biotic/abiotic status and gradients in meltwater, seepage, and upwelling. At the microhabitat level, the abundance of nematodes, tardigrades, rotifers, and microarthropods is directly proportional to microvariations in relative humidity. Upward migration of soil microalgae in response to water availability, together with seasonal population peaks of bacteria, algae, and protozoa at snowthaw, suggest moisture limitation on vertical and temporal scales. It is concluded that, in Antarctica, many of the limiting effects previously attributed to low temperature may in fact operate through the water balance of organisms.

In this study, we collected air samples from 100 locations around the 21 Southern Ocean to analyze bacterial biodiversity in the circumpolar air around the Antarctic 22 continent as understanding dispersal processes is paramount to assessing the risks of 23 microbiological invasions. We also compared the Southern Ocean air bacterial biodiversity to other 24 non-polar ecosystems to identify the potential origin of these Southern Ocean air microorganisms. 25 The bacterial diversity in the air had both local and global origins and presented low richness overall 26 but high heterogeneity, compatible with a scenario whereby samples are composed of a suite of 27 different species in very low relative abundances. Only 4% of Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) 28 were identified in both polar and non-polar air masses, suggesting that the polar air mass over the 29 Southern Ocean can act as a selective dispersal filter. Furthermore, both microbial diversity and 30 community structure both varied significantly with meteorological data, suggesting that regional 31 bacterial biodiversity could be sensitive to changes in weather conditions, potentially altering the 32 existing pattern of microbial deposition in the Antarctic.3334 Keywords3536 Antarctica, Aerobiology, Dispersal, Bacteria, Biodiversity, Invasion, Climate Change3738 Introduction39 Parts of Antarctica are warming at record rates, affecting both ecosystems and associated 40 biota and processes (Convey & Peck, 2019, Pörtner et al., 2019, Clem et al., 2020). The resulting 41 changes are difficult to predict as the impact of climate change on these local communities and their 42 ecosystem functions are still not well defined. It has been predicted that anthropogenic activities 43 and climate change will weaken both biogeographic boundaries and dispersal barriers of terrestrial 44 and marine ecosystems, increasing the risks of biological invasions (Convey & Peck, 2019). 45 Although humans participate in the dispersal of non-indigenous microorganisms, the impact of 46 anthropogenic activities is still limited in Antarctica (Cowan et al., 2011) and aerial transport 47 remains the primary source of new biological input such as moss and lichen spores, near-48 microscopic fauna and microorganisms (Marshall et al., 1996; Smith et al., 2013, Barberán et al., 49 2014, Barberán et al., 2015, Smets et al., 2016, Maki et al., 2019). However, the contribution of 50 aerial dispersal in shaping the overall pattern of biodiversity and ecosystem function remains poorly 51 understood. 52 For Antarctic invasions (and ultimately colonisation), access might represent a particular 53 challenge as the continent is both geographically remote and air and water currents in the region 54 form a potential dispersal barrier around the continent. Indeed, it has been suggested that the 55 Antarctic Convergence zone within the Southern Ocean, and the resulting Antarctic circumpolar 56 vortex, as well as the ‘cyclone belt’ surrounding Antarctica (with commonly four or five distinct 57 cyclones effectively ‘following’ each other around the continent) can act as a dispersal barrier for 58 airborne organisms (Pearce et al., 2009, Womack et al., 2010, Archer et al., 2019, King-Miaow et 59 al., 2019, Uetake et al., 2020). Whether that is the case and the implication of a changing climate 60 on this potential dispersal barrier are yet to be determined (Womack et al., 2010). It is also worthy 61 of note that the large-scale atmospheric patterns around the continent are from west to east. As a 62 result, airborne organisms may circulate around the continent several times before moving further 63 south. 64 For decades, the focus has been on macro-organisms (Lonsdale, 1999) with only recent 65 interest for microbial invasions (Mallon et al., 2015, Kinnunen et al., 2016, Malard & Pearce, 2022). 66 This is largely because for a long time, ‘everything is everywhere, but the environment selects’ 67 (Bass Becking, 1934) led to the assumption that microorganisms lack the biogeographic patterns 68 necessary for differential distribution. Only the development of high throughput sequencing has 69 been able to provide overwhelming evidence that microorganisms do display specific 70 biogeographic distribution patterns (Tedersoo et al., 2014, Bahram et al., 2018, Delgado-Baquerizo 71 et al., 2018) suggesting the potential for dispersal limitation and that microbial invasions are likely 72 to be ecologically important, impacting the diversity and function of resident communities.73 Whether microbial biogeography in the atmosphere exists at all is still open to question and 74 requires further research. Indeed, little attention has been given to microbial diversity patterns in 75 the atmosphere as the environment has traditionally been regarded as a conduit rather than a habitat 76 (Wommack et al. 2010). Recent studies have begun addressing these issues in the atmosphere, 77 showing for example that marine bioaerosol communities can be distinct from those found in 78 adjacent terrestrial locations (Siefried et al. 2015). Overall, studies in other regions have shown that 79 patterns of microbial dispersal are predominantly local (Herbold et al., 2014) interspersed with 80 sporadic long-range events (Smith et al., 2013, Barberán et al., 2014, Barberán et al., 2015, 81 Crawford et al., 2017, Maki et al., 2019). If the aerial microbiology around the Antarctic follows 82 this pattern, it will have very important implications in terms of conservation and the maintenance 83 of the microbial biodiversity in the region. Indeed, lower environmental filtering due to the 84 weakening of dispersal barriers induced by climate change may support the transport and 85 establishment of cosmopolitan taxa, capable of long-distance dispersal, over more specialized and 86 endemic taxa and may support the invasion of non-indigenous taxa to the Antarctic. Therefore, 87 identifying the origin of incoming airborne microbes is essential to predict the potential impact of 88 their integration into local ecosystems. 89 Although it is now well established that microorganisms spread through the air, the process 90 is limited by survival (Cowan et al., 2011), which is likely to have represented a significant natural 91 barrier against this type of invasions in the past. However, whether microbial survival in air is to 92 change, or can change following rapid climate warming, remains to be determined. Microorganisms 93 are known to be metabolically active in the atmosphere (Tignat-Perrier et al., 2020). They 94 participate in cloud formation, impacting precipitation patterns through ice nucleation (Fröhlich-95 Nowoisky et al., 2016, Šantl-Temkiv et al., 2019); therefore, airborne microorganisms have 96 influence on cloud formation, radiation and precipitation (Sato & Inoue, 2021). The changing 97 climate leads to changes in the frequency, intensity, spatial extent, duration, and timing of extreme 98 weather and climate events in general (Seneviratne et al., 2021) and in particular also over the 99 Southern Ocean (Meucci et al., 2020, Hepworth et al., 2022). Moreover, persistent features that 100 strongly influence the atmospheric dynamics of the Southern Ocean change with a changing 101 climate, such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation (Cai et al., 2022) and intensification and 102 latitudinal shift of the westerly winds (Perren et al., 2020, Liang et al., 2021). Thus, understanding 103 the direct link between climatological conditions and biological dispersal is essential to determine 104 the rate of climate-driven ecological change worldwide and for the Antarctic, over the Southern 105 Ocean. Studies have already suggested that temperature, UV radiation, humidity and weather-106 related factors may impact atmospheric diversity elsewhere (Šantl-Temkiv et al., 2018, Tignat-107 Perrier et al., 2019) while others have found little to no correlation (Uetake et al., 2020), illustrating 108 the need for more global and standardised research in the field. 109 To answer these questions, the first step is to investigate the biodiversity of the atmosphere, 110 the factors that influence this aerial diversity and to identify potential dispersal barriers. To date, 111 the overwhelming picture emerging from the air sampled across the Antarctic is one of relatively 112 low biomass but high diversity across all samples (Busse et al., 2003, Pearce et al., 2009, Van Houdt 113 et al., 2009, Bottos et al., 2014, Herbold et al., 2014, Archer et al., 2019). However, the drivers of 114 this diversity and its origins remain elusive. 115 In this study, we collected air samples from 100 locations around the Southern Ocean and 116 its islands as well as seven concurrent precipitation samples. This included unique samples from 117 marine areas that are normally inaccessible as well as the sub- and peri-Antarctic islands. Focusing 118 on bacterial communities, we used this data to make two core comparisons: a) Southern Ocean 119 samples derived in this study with existing published sequences derived from different habitats 120 around the globe, and b) sequences obtained in this study combined to air sequences from other 121 studies and separated North and South of the Antarctic Convergence zone. The primary aim of this 122 study was to test the hypothesis that the Antarctic Convergence zone acts as a dispersal barrier, 123 limiting the risk of microbiological invasions to continental Antarctica. 124125 Results and Discussion126127 1.

A total 131 of 107 samples (± 19032 reads/sample) with 1013 assigned amplicon sequence variants were 132 identified in Antarctic air and precipitation samples. Overall, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, 133 Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla across all samples [Fig. 1]. These 134 phyla are consistent with other studies of global aerobiological biodiversity (DeLeon-Rodriguez et 135 al., 2013, Smith et al., 2013, Cuthbertson et al., 2017, Mayol et al., 2017, Els et al., 2019, Tignat-136 Perrier et al., 2019, Tignat-Perrier et al., 2020, Lang-Yona et al., 2022), including Antarctica 137 (Archer et al., 2019, Uetake et al., 2020). While these four phyla have been shown to dominate the 138 atmospheric diversity globally, many others have been identified, and across this study twenty-139 seven bacterial phyla were identified [Supplementary Data 2]. These included, for example, 140 Nitrospirota, Verrucomicrobia, Plantomycetes and Acidobacteria, which are important members of 141 most airborne communities (Bowers et al., 2009, Bowers et al., 2011, Šantl-Temkiv et al., 2018, 142 Els et al., 2019), including in Antarctica (Bottos et al., 2014, Uetake et al., 2020). The presence of 143 these phyla may also indicate the importance of the contribution from aquatic or soil bacterial 144 sources (DeLeon-Rodriguez et al., 2013, Uetake et al., 2020). 145 We also identified a total of 378 genera [Supplementary Data 2], notably Enhydrobacter 146 (Gammaproteobacteria, relative abundance: 4.8%), Psychrobacter (Gammaproteobacteria, relative 147 abundance: 3.7%), Staphylococcus (Firmicutes, relative abundance: 1.2%), Mesorhizobium 148 (Alphaproteobacteria, relative abundance: 1.2%) and Acinetobacter (Gammaproteobacteria, 149 relative abundance: 0.9%). These have all been identified in Antarctic air samples (Archer et al., 150 2019) and elsewhere (Els et al., 2019, Archer et al., 2020, Tignat-Perrier et al., 2020). While the 151 relative abundance of each genus is variable, consistent genera are identified in air samples globally. 152 For example, Enhydrobacter has recently been identified in the air over the Atlantic and Pacific 153 Oceans but not in the associated oceanic waters. Enhydrobacter has been proposed for a 154 reclassification to the family Rhodospirillaceae (purple non-sulfur bacteria, in the 155 Alphaproteobacteria), a family of phototrophic organisms. Lang-Yona et al. (2022) also found that 156 Massilia, Acinetobacter and Mesorhizobium were associated with oceanic air communities. Across 157 all aerobiology studies to date, it appears that there are consistent dominant phyla and genera, 158 suggesting that there may be a common aerial microbiome, but that abundance and diversity may 159 vary significantly by region (Archer et al., 2021 Preprint).160161162163164 Figure 1: Map of the air sampling locations, shaped by sample type and coloured by the origin of 165 the air mass (back trajectory) relative to the Antarctic Convergence.

The microbial taxa dominating Southern 167 Ocean (SO) air are highly variable with geographic location, even for consecutive samples and at 168 the Phylum level. 169170 2.  How does the Southern Ocean air biodiversity compare globally with other ecosystems?171 a. Alpha diversity 172 We compared the alpha diversity of the Southern Ocean air (SO air) and precipitation 173 samples to published sequences from air sampled from other locations (referred to as ‘global air’) 174 and both marine and terrestrial (ie. non-air) ecosystems [Fig. 2, Fig. S1]. Overall, the richness and 175 diversity were much lower in all air samples (mean air richness/diversity: 27.5-30.6/1.83-2.57) 176 when compared to soil and marine ecosystems (mean global soil richness/diversity: 560/5.5, mean 177 open ocean richness/diversity: 233/3.58). The Southern Ocean air diversity also showed a higher 178 heterogeneity (mean SO air Simpson index: 0.70) [Table S1] than other ecosystems. Globally, we 179 found that soil microbial richness and diversity tended to a maximum in temperate regions, 180 confirming a previously observed pattern (Bahram et al., 2018). Marine microbial biodiversity 181 tended to increase towards the poles, also a pattern that had previously been observed (Ladau et al., 182 2013). However, while air-borne microbial richness was relatively stable with latitude across the 183 globe, diversity decreased significantly with increasing latitude [Fig. 3]. Regionally, Uetake et al. 184 (2020) demonstrated a decrease in alpha diversity of airborne bacteria communities with increasing 185 latitude, from Australia to the Antarctic continent. We should note that the Arctic is not represented 186 in this comparison due to a lack of data availability from that region, and, as such, high latitude air 187 samples correspond only to the Southern Ocean air samples collected in our study. Whether this 188 pattern holds for the Arctic region is still to be determined. Overall, the decrease in diversity at high 189 latitudes was driven by the high unevenness of the airborne communities [Fig. 3]. Indeed, the 190 Simpson index indicated that some communities were very uneven, especially at the highest 191 latitudes, with one or few species largely dominating the communities [Fig. 3]. This variability of 192 SO air communities was also reflected in the community composition [Fig. 1, Fig. 4A] and is in 193 line with other highly variable airborne communities elsewhere (Lang-Yona et al., 2022)194195196197 Figure 2. Comparison of the alpha diversity of Southern Ocean air (SO Air, n=100) and 198 precipitation (SO Precipitation, n=7) to other global air samples (global air, n=98) and other non-199 air ecosystems including surface open ocean (n=123), surface coastal ocean (n= 7), global soils 200 (n=146), Arctic soils (n=43) and Antarctic soils (n=113)201202203204 Figure 3: Latitudinal distribution of the richness and diversity of air (n = 198), marine (n = 130) 205 and soil (n = 302) bacterial communities. The absolute latitude was used, merging northern and 206 southern latitudes. Second order polynomials fits are shown with R2 and associated p-values.207 b. Beta diversity208 We compared the beta diversity of global bacterial communities using non-metric 209 multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to view differences in community composition between sample 210 types [Fig. 4A]. The Antarctic soil communities were different from other soil communities and 211 presented lower richness and diversity than other soil samples [Fig. 2]. This was further observed 212 at the phylum level, with Antarctic soils harbouring more Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes [Fig. 213 4B]. Surface open ocean marine communities clustered away from coastal ocean marine 214 communities, primarily due to the high relative abundance of Cyanobacteria, which represented 215 over 50 % of the surface ocean communities. Global air communities clustered away from Southern 216 Ocean air communities, with Proteobacteria representing 75 % of the global air communities. Utake 217 et al. (2020) looking at global patterns of bacterial diversity in the air found a latitudinal 218 differentiation of composition at the phylum level. Here, we observed more Proteobacteria in global 219 air community samples while Southern Ocean air communities harboured more Firmicutes and 220 Bacteroidetes, known to form endospores protecting the genetic material of the bacteria (Martiny 221 et al., 2006, Filippidou et al., 2016). However, we observed a decrease in Firmicutes but increase 222 in Bacteroidetes with increasing latitude. While the difference in communities may reflect the 223 selection pressure of local environmental conditions, we cannot exclude the influence of different 224 sampling protocols and sequencing approaches on the community composition, despite the use of 225 the same primers. Overall, global air, marine and terrestrial communities were different from each 226 other (PERMANOVA, R2 = 0.14, p = 0.001), and Southern Ocean air communities were unique, 227 highly heterogeneous, and different from other airborne communities elsewhere PERMANOVA, 228 R2 = 0.08, p < 0.001).   229230231232 Figure 4. A. Visualization of community dissimilarity using non-metric multidimensional scaling 233 (NMDS) of the Bray-Curtis distance between air, marine, and soil bacterial communities. B. 234 Relative abundance of bacteria at the phylum level. 235236 c. Biomass237 In this study, 3,322,968 L of air was collected in total across an 85-day period. It contained 238 a total cell density as estimated by qPCR of the 16S rRNA gene of 7.5 x 102 cells m-3 and above. 239 Despite the comparative hostility of the environment, remoteness from traditionally recognised 240 sources of air-borne bacteria, apparent low levels of nutrients and desiccation, significant numbers 241 of bacteria were consistently found across the region. This is much lower than has been cited for 242 other locations around the globe. Indeed, studies have shown that global concentrations of bacteria 243 in the atmosphere generally range from 104 to 106 cells m-3 although these studies have showed that 244 the range of airborne microbial concentrations is far wider than this and is highly variable (Gandolfi 245 et al., 2013, Šantl-Temkiv et al., 2018, Maki et al., 2019, Tignat-Perrier et al., 2019). For example, 246 across nine global sampling sites, bacterial concentrations varied from 9.2 x 101 to 1.3 x 108 cells 247 m-3 with the lowest concentration recoded in Station Nord at the Villum research station 248 (Greenland) and the highest bacterial concentration recorded on the semi-arid plateau of Namco 249 (China) at over 4700m elevation (Tignat-Perrier et al., 2019). In Nuuk (Greenland), bacterial 250 concentrations of 1.3 × 103 ± 1.0 × 103 cells m-3 have been recorded (Šantl-Temkiv et al., 2018) 251 while bacterial concentration in free tropospheric air above the Alps ranges from 3.4 x 104 cells to 252 2.67 x 105 m-3 (Xia et al., 2014). Of particular relevance to this study, the average microbial 253 abundances in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) are quoted as ~ 1.9 × 104 bacteria m−3 (Mayol 254 et al. 2017).  Hence, in common with broad scale observed patterns in the higher animals and plants, 255 we observed a significant decrease in biomass with latitude. We can therefore conclude that the 256 total biomass in the atmosphere over the Southern Ocean is low, and between one to two orders of 257 magnitude lower than the biomass found elsewhere. This observation was consistent with the 258 abundance of fluorescent particles 0.00017-0.1201 m3, a previously used best estimate of biomass 259 in the air above the Southern Ocean (Moallemi et al. 2021).260261 3. How unique are Southern Ocean airborne communities?262 The Southern Ocean air and global air communities shared 4% of the total number of ASVs 263 combined totaling 139 shared ASVs [Fig. 5A], primarily Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and 264 Actinobacteria [Fig. 5B]. This result alone suggested that the air over the Southern Ocean does not 265 act as a strict dispersal barrier but a rather selective barrier to microorganisms entering the Antarctic 266 (since these common ASVs were identified in non-polar ecosystems). However, the relatively low 267 number in common strongly suggests that it could be acting as a selective dispersal filter. 268 Furthermore, although this is a relatively low number of ASVs, their mean relative abundance 269 across all samples was equivalent to 36 % of the communities. In comparison, the 788 ASVs unique 270 to the Southern Ocean air represented 34 % of the communities while the 2270 ASVs unique to the 271 global air also represented 30 % [Supplementary data 3]. In other words, about 1/3 appear 272 potentially restricted to the Southern Ocean, 1/3 appear potentially common to the rest of the globe 273 (except the Southern Ocean) and 1/3 appear cosmopolitan in terms of relative abundance. This 274 result highlights the presence of a low number of highly abundant taxa, and a high number of very 275 low abundance taxa in each community and confirms the very high variability in diversity discussed 276 previously in this study and observed by other studies and is important in terms of why microbial 277 biodiversity is important ie though environmental function and community resilience (via factors 278 such as functional gene redundancy).  279280281282283 Figure 5. A: number of ASVs (# ASVs) shared between global air and Southern Ocean air samples. 284 The percentage indicates the relative abundance (Rel. Ab.) represented by the number of ASVs 285 across all samples. B. Relative abundance of shared bacteria at the phylum level. 286287 This result is perhaps unsurprising, as core microbiomes are starting to emerge as a common 288 feature of microbiological biodiversity and biogeography studies worldwide. Els et al. (2019) 289 identified a core microbiome in free tropospheric air microbial community over Mount Sonnblick 290 in the Austrian Alps (3106 m above sea level) which consisted of 61 OTUs (11% of all the OTUs 291 they detected). Archer et al. (2019) found in a direct comparison that Antarctic non-native 292 assemblages shared only 5.7% of bacterial ASVs with markedly more diverse bioaerosols found in 293 New Zealand. In contrast, in this study, while 139 ASVs were shared between Southern Ocean air 294 and global air, we did not identify any ASV present in over 50 % of all air samples. The most 295 prevalent ASV shared by 25 % of all samples was classified as a Psychrobacter 296 (Gammaproteobacteria). They are aerobic, Gram-negative coccobacilli and most Psychrobacter 297 strains are psychrotrophic and can grow at 5 °C. Many strains are also radiation resistant, making 298 them well adapted to live in the air (Juni, 2015).    299 The 4% ASV similarity in polar and non-polar air were diverse in taxonomy including both 300 cosmopolitan species and extremophiles, most represented by only one sequence variant (where 301 more than one ASV, the number is indicated in parentheses). Of the 139 ASVs identified as present 302 in both Antarctic and non-Antarctic air, about 50% were attributable to specific environmental 303 species [Table 1]. 304305Notable characteristics  GenusUbiquitous to all ecosystems Pseudomonas (4), Brevundimonas (2)Cosmopolitan/ubiquitous in soils and/or waterAcinetobacter (6), Actinomyces, Flavobacterium (3) and related Sphingobacterium, Sphingobacteriaceae, Empedobacter, Massilia (3), Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum (3), Rhodococcus, Variovorax and Bacteroides (4)Identified in Freshwater Aeromonas, Brevundimonas (a Gram negative bacterium widely distributed in nature), Candidatus Limnoluna affiliated with the Phylum Actinobacteria, Candidatus Planktophila an actinobacterium representing one of the most important taxa in freshwater bacterioplankton, Caulobacter an aquatic bacterium that thrives in nutrient poor environments, Chryseobacterium (2), Enhydrobacter, Aquabacterium (2) and Rhodoferax (purple non-sulphur bacteria)Identified in air Enhydrobacter and AerococcusExtremophiles Shewanella, Psychrobacter, TepidomonasGram positive Blastococcus, Blastomonas, Brachybacterium, Carnobacterium, Corynebacterium (7) and ActinomycesFunctional (involved in the Nitrogen cycle)Ellin6067, Lentimicrobium, Noviherbaspirillum, Paracoccus, Burkholderia-Caballeronia-Paraburkholderia, BradyrhizobiumFunctional (Methylotrophic) MethyloteneraOther notable taxa (as not marine) Betaproteobacterium Malikia and Cornamonadaceae (3)306307 Table 1: A non-exhaustive list of the genera shared across all air samples and their ecosystem or 308 notable characteristics  309310 4. What is the role of the sub- and peri-Antarctic islands? 311 In this study, while most samples were collected aboard the ship (n=90) in the Southern 312 Ocean (SO air over ocean), samples (n=10) were also collected on land, on the Antarctic and sub-313 and peri-Antarctic islands (SO air over land). Despite the species richness of air over terrestrial and 314 marine environments being similar (ANOVA, p = 0.58), a significant difference was found in both 315 the Shannon and Simpson diversity indices between Southern Ocean air samples taken over marine 316 sites when compared to those taken over terrestrial sites [Fig. S2A]. Air communities were equally 317 rich but communities over oceans were very uneven compared to those taken over islands. The 318 difference in community composition between air samples was driven by the high variability of 319 communities over the Ocean [Fig. S2B]. In total, 689 ASVs were uniquely identified in SO air over 320 ocean while only 87 ASVs were unique to the air over land [Fig. S2C]. Furthermore, we observed 321 that each of the Islands had a distinct pattern of biodiversity in the air above them, suggesting that 322 each of the Islands in the Southern Ocean is unique [Fig. S3]. The pattern of aerial biodiversity 323 above the Islands of the Southern Ocean suggests that for the Southern Ocean at least, we can 324 probably discount the ‘air-bridge’ or ‘stepping-stone’ hypothesis, by which microbial biodiversity 325 does not reach the Antarctic continent by using islands as stepping-stones to reduce the effective 326 distance it is necessary to travel. It does, however, argue for the importance of conservation and 327 biosecurity measures tailored to each island location, since each island has its own unique 328 biodiversity (and hence influence on the environment around it). 329330 5. Which environmental factors affect Southern Ocean air bacterial communities?331 a. Pressure and cyclones332 We tested the influence of several key environmental and meteorological variables on the 333 diversity and community composition. Of the environmental parameters recorded at the time of 334 sampling (latitude, longitude, pressure, air temperature, relative humidity, average wind direction, 335 average wind speed, maximum wind speed, minimum wind speed, dew point, cloud level and solar 336 irradiance) and the atmospheric state over the five previous days of each sample (cold or warm 337 advected air, maximum potential temperature (theta), median latitude of air mass trajectory and the 338 presence or absence of a cyclone), none correlated with the aerial richness, diversity and evenness 339 of communities over the Southern Ocean [Table S2]. The random forest models did not explain any 340 of the variance observed in alpha diversity of these communities.  We can therefore tentatively 341 conclude that, at least in the immediate to short-term, the atmospheric environment itself is not the 342 primary determinant of the bacterial diversity of the air above the Southern Ocean.343 However, when investigating the effect of environmental parameters on community 344 composition, we found that the average maximum potential temperature (max theta indicates the 345 altitude of the originating air mass) and the air pressure resulted in a significant relationship with 346 community composition based on the permanova test [Table S2] and that the presence of cyclones 347 might increase the dissimilarity of communities [Figure 6A].  348349350351 Figure 6. A. Differences in community dissimilarity (Bray-Curtis) with the presence and absence 352 of cyclones. B. Linear model of community dissimilarity (Bray-Curtis) along the maximum 353 potential temperature of five-day back trajectories. C. Linear model of community dissimilarity 354 (Bray-Curtis) along the pressure gradient.355 High maximum potential temperature displayed somewhat higher community dissimilarity 356 [Fig. 6B]. As the potential temperature is a surrogate for the air mass origin, a high value suggests 357 that air masses have descended diabatically from the atmosphere further aloft, likely indicating their 358 origin from further north, perhaps the rest of the globe, hence the high variability in community 359 composition (although the data itself does not validate this interpretation). During low pressure 360 system situations, the community composition is more dissimilar and less stable [Fig. 6C]. Low 361 pressure systems are associated with cyclones, a frequent and highly characteristic feature of the 362 Southern Ocean (Papritz et al., 2014), and indeed we do see, albeit weak, a relationship between 363 higher community composition dissimilarity and cyclone presence [Fig. 6A].364 Clearly, an in-depth interpretation of this relationship is not possible with the observations 365 available. Indeed, we are still a very long way from an understanding of exactly how physical 366 parameters would mechanistically influence communities in the air. However, it is conceivable that 367 the cyclogenesis mixes air masses from different sources, leading to more diverse and variable 368 communities. 369 b. Precipitation370 In this study, we collected some precipitation samples during the rare events (n=7 371 precipitation events but only four days of precipitation in total) as well as air samples before or after 372 the event. Precipitation samples presented higher richness and communities were significantly 373 different from Southern Ocean air sampled on the same day [Fig. S4]. Precipitation samples were 374 largely dominated by Proteobacteria (Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria) while 375 concurrent air samples were more diverse with Firmicutes, Alpha- and Gamma- Proteobacteria and 376 Actinobacteria [Fig. S4]. Interestingly, 15 of the ASVs shared with the precipitation samples were 377 also identified in the 4% of shared ASVs between the polar and global air. These included 378 Enhydrobacter, Bradyrhizobium, Aquabacterium and Rhodoferax (Table 1). 379 Recent studies have shown that precipitation communities differ significantly from the air 380 communities at the time of precipitation events. For example, a study showed an increase in 381 bacterial concentrations in the air preceding a storm (Xia et al., 2013) and others have suggested 382 that microorganisms precipitated with fog, cloud water, snow, hail or rain differ in their species 383 composition from free tropospheric air masses and thus, do not mirror the air community structure 384 (Amato et al., 2017, Els et al., 2019, Evans et al., 2019). These studies suggest that snow or cloud 385 samples are not suitable proxies for free troposphere air microbiome composition.386 The implication of this observation is that precipitation provides increased biodiversity 387 input. As a result, precipitation patterns could influence microbial biodiversity in Southern Ocean 388 air through the addition of new diversity or through a change in the pattern of dominant groups. 389 This lends support to the idea that high altitude transfer is more important for biodiversity and 390 colonisation than low altitude transfer. Precipitation is formed mostly via the ice phase in clouds 391 (Korolev & Field, 2008), which may be the reason behind those biodiversity differences. The ice 392 phase in clouds relies on ice nucleating particles, and bioaerosols are prime ice nucleating particles 393 (INP) (Petters & Wright, 2015) Hence, precipitation samples might sub-select airborne 394 microorganisms that are good INP, for example, Gammaproteobacteria which are well known for 395 their ice nucleation activity (Failor et al., 2017). Given the formation level of clouds, they can both 396 originate from a source in the marine boundary layer and from aloft, the latter indicating long-range 397 transport. Although precipitation events are still relatively infrequent in this region, models suggest 398 that precipitations will increase, especially in the higher latitudes of the Southern Ocean (Liu & 399 Curry, 2010, Bracegirdle et al., 2020). 400 c. Other factors influencing communities401 Of particular significance, given the availability and use of back-track trajectory data, and 402 the idea that wind moves biodiversity from one location to another, was the apparent lack of 403 influence of either wind speed or, more importantly, wind direction. The impact of the wind on 404 aerial communities is still unclear as some studies have found some impacts of wind speed and 405 direction on communities (Tignat-Perrier et al., 2019, Tignat-Perrier et al., 2020), while others have 406 not (Uetake et al., 2020).  Furthermore, when considering the impact of wind speed and direction, 407 we must also consider temporal variables and spatial variables (as the vessel was moving) and 408 therefore, the situation is likely complex. Other environmental factors such as air temperature, UV 409 radiation or humidity have been suggested to have some influence on airborne communities (Šantl-410 Temkiv et al., 2018, Tignat-Perrier et al., 2019, Tignat-Perrier et al., 2020, Archer et al., 2021 411 Preprint) but this was not observed in the Southern Ocean. Overall, observations tend to vary by 412 study, likely reflecting the importance of local conditions at the time of sampling.413414 6. Where do Southern Ocean airborne bacteria likely originate? 415 Here, we used source-tracking to determine the potential ecosystem of origin of the ASVs 416 identified in the Southern Ocean air and precipitation samples. Of the 1013 Southern Ocean ASVs 417 identified, 584 were identified in the global database produced and therefore, had a potential origin 418 [Fig. 7A]. These contributed to 41 % of the total relative abundance across the whole database, 419 suggesting these were rather dominant taxa. Interestingly, we could not explain more than 30% of 420 the origin of the different Southern Ocean sample types [Fig. 7B], further highlighting the unique 421 ASVs identified in each group of samples. More taxa from other airborne sources were identified 422 in the precipitation samples while more taxa of terrestrial origin, especially Antarctic soils, were 423 identified in the sub- and peri-Antarctic islands’ air [Fig. 7C]. This result is an indication of the 424 stronger influence of local inputs in these samples, suggesting that islands have a strong influence 425 on the biodiversity of the air above them. Across the study, we found low numbers of ASVs of 426 marine origin [Fig. 7C-F], despite most of the sampling being conducted above the ocean. The 427 overall low input of ocean-associated microorganisms into the air globally (Archer et al., 2021 428 Preprint) may explain the limited influence of local ecosystems as sources of airborne 429 microorganisms over the oceans, as shown in this study and over the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans 430 (Mayol et al., 2017, Lang-Yona et al., 2022). 431 In the literature, the consensus about the origins of aerobiological diversity is a combination 432 of both, aerosolization of local material and long-distance transport, and differential source regions 433 and transport have been shown to influence microbial composition of the atmosphere (DeLeon-434 Rodriguez et al., 2013, Šantl-Temkiv et al., 2018). In oceanic air masses, microorganisms appear 435 to originate primarily from long-distance transport of terrestrial microorganisms, although large 436 uncertainties remain on the origins of ASVs. Only a standardised global investigation of microbial 437 communities in all ecosystems, as was started with the Earth Microbiome Project (Thompson et al., 438 2017), and the creation of an open-source database could shed light on the origin and dispersal 439 patterns of microorganisms in the air.  440441442443444 Figure 7: A. Euler diagram showing the number of ASVs (# ASVs) with an origin identified from 445 the global database and the relative abundance (Rel. Ab.). B. Mean potential origin of ASVs across 446 each Southern Ocean sample type. C-F. Mean origin of ASVs per sample type.  447448 7. Is the Antarctic Convergence Zone limiting bacterial dispersal to the Antarctic continent?449 Finally, we tested the hypothesis that the Antarctic Convergence might act as a dispersal 450 barrier (Pearce et al., 2009, Archer et al., 2019, King-Miaow et al., 2019, Uetake et al., 2020). To 451 this end, and to consider the dynamic movements of air masses rather than consider the convergence 452 as a static barrier, we identified the origin of the air mass using 5-day back track trajectories and 453 compared the median latitude of the air mass to the latitude of the Antarctic Convergence at the 454 relevant longitude. We compared global air samples (always considered north) and Southern Ocean 455 air samples north of the Antarctic Convergence to the Southern Ocean air samples collected south 456 of the convergence [Fig. 8]. We found differences in evenness and community composition, mainly 457 driven by the global air communities [Fig. 8B] as these differences were not apparent when 458 comparing only Southern Ocean air sample north and south of the convergence. The majority of 459 ASVs were unique to samples either north or south of the convergence, with 308 ASVs (9 % of the 460 total ASVs) shared between both [Fig. 8C]. Hence, the Antarctic Convergence does not appear to 461 be acting as a strict dispersal barrier but rather, the Southern Ocean may itself act as a selective 462 dispersal filter. The size of the Southern Ocean and remoteness of the continent might, in 463 themselves, be major filters of microorganisms unable to survive in the air longer than the minimum 464 time required to attain suitable ecosystems. Therefore, the Southern Ocean itself may be limiting 465 the dispersal of global airborne microorganisms to the Antarctic continent. 466467468469470471 Figure 8: Influence of the Antarctic Convergence Zone on microbial diversity above the Southern 472 Ocean, using global air samples as well as the samples collected during the ACE expedition around 473 the Southern Ocean.

We found that air communities over the Southern Ocean and its islands 485 were significantly different from other ecosystems. However, these differences were not due to the 486 Antarctic Convergence Zone acting as a dispersal barrier, but rather the Southern Ocean acting as 487 a selective dispersal filter. We identified 139 ASVs that were previously identified in air samples 488 elsewhere, suggesting that these taxa may be pre-adapted to life in the atmosphere, efficient 489 dispersers and therefore, may form part of a potential aerobiome. 490 Significant differences in microbial air diversity following meteorological patterns (air 491 pressure, maximum potential temperature and the presence or absence of cyclones) and differences 492 in communities from precipitation events suggests that bacterial biodiversity may be sensitive to 493 changes in weather patterns that may result from climate change. These observations have 494 important implications as climate change is known to increase precipitation in the Arctic (Pörtner 495 et al., 2019). If they also increase in the Antarctic, it will lead to increased rates of microbial input 496 and potentially higher diversity and increased risks of biological invasions. In addition, as the region 497 warms, there will be more ice-free areas and free niches to colonise, potentially disrupting 498 ecosystem function. Therefore, changing weather patterns through climate change may increase the 499 frequency or the ability of microorganisms to reach Antarctica, illustrating the key role of the 500 atmosphere the biogeography of microorganisms in Antarctica. 501502 Materials and Methods503 ACE expedition and environmental data504 Antarctic air samples were collected aboard the R/V Akademik Tryoshnikov over an 85-505 day period between December 22nd, 2016, and March 16th, 2017, whilst the ship circumnavigated 506 the Antarctic continent. The circumnavigation began and ended at Cape Town with stops at Hobart, 507 Australia and Punta Arenas, Chile during the voyage [Figure 1A] (Landwehr et al., 2021). Location 508 via GPS co-ordinates and weather data were collected continuously throughout the voyage via a 509 Vaisala weather station aboard the ship, and included Latitude, Longitude, Average wind direction, 510 Average wind speed, Minimum wind speed, Maximum wind speed, Cloud level, Sky coverage, 511 Relative humidity, Temperature, Dew point, Pressure, Solar radiance and UV. 512 We used back trajectories (Thurnherr et al., 2020) calculated with the Lagrangian analysis 513 tool LAGRANTO (Sprenger & Wernli, 2015) based on wind fields from the operational analysis 514 data of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) to derive the 515 maximum potential temperature and median latitude within the five days prior of the air mass’ 516 arrival to the sampling location (see details in Schmale et al. (2019). We released 20 trajectories 517 from within the boundary layer around the ship position each hour and averaged those for the 518 duration of the sample collection. To classify whether a sample experienced air masses coming 519 primarily from north or south of the polar front, we compared the median latitude per sample to the 520 latitude of the Antarctic Convergence at the relevant longitude. The presence or absence of cyclones 521 and the location of the sampling in the warm or cold sector of a cyclone were derived from published 522 data sets (Thurnherr et al., 2020, Thurnherr & Wernli, 2020) and as described in Thurnherr et al. 523 (2021).524 Air and precipitation sample collection 525 Southern Ocean air samples were collected with sampling units set around the vessel to 526 reduce the influence of sea spray and potential human bacterial sources [Figure 1B]. Air samples 527 from terrestrial locations were collected at the sub-Antarctic islands of Kerguelen, Balleny, Crozet, 528 Bouvet and South Georgia and occasionally over the Antarctic continent. For terrestrial sites, 529 sampling units were positioned at a height of 1.5m to reduce the impact of local turbulence. 530 Dry samples were collected via a membrane filtration apparatus set up, whereby a Welch 531 WOB-L vacuum pump at a flow rate of 20L min-1 (Welch, Mt. Prospect, IL, USA) was connected 532 by tubing to a Sartorius filtration unit (Göttingen, Germany) containing a 47 mm × 0.2 μm pore 533 size cellulose nitrate membrane filter (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Chicago, IL, USA). Samples 534 were collected opportunistically for between one and 36 hours. Dry samples were supplemented 535 with a surface air system (SAS) sampler as backup. Wet samples were collected via a Bertin 536 Coriolis μ (Bertin Technologies, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France), where the collection cones 537 were filled with sterile DNase and RNase free H2O (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the sampler run 538 at a flow rate of 300 L m-1 for a duration of 50 minutes. Wet samples were supplemented with an 539 SKC sampler as backup. Precipitation samples were collected using a sterile funnel and filtered 540 onto nitrocellulose 0.22 µm filters (Merck  Millipore,  Germany) using a sterile filtration unit 541 (Sartorius, Groningen, Germany).  All samples were stored at -80 °C for the duration of the 542 expedition. 543 DNA extraction and 16S amplicon sequencing544 In total, 100 air samples and 7 precipitation samples were used in this study. Samples 545 collected on filter substrates were first dissected into quarters using an ethanol and flame sterilised 546 scalpel and a sterile petri dish in a Class II Microbiological safety cabinet. The dissected quarter 547 filter was then placed directly into a labelled bead tube for extraction. Water-based (Coriolis) 548 samples stored either in collection cones or falcon tubes were transferred to sterile 15 mL falcon 549 tubes and centrifuged for a duration of 20 minutes at 5000 g. Following centrifugation, the 550 supernatant was removed leaving 1 mL, within which the formed pellet was re-suspended. This 1 551 mL was then loaded directly into a labelled bead tube for extraction. Where samples contained more 552 than 15 mL liquid, they were combined after centrifugation, and the previous steps were repeated.553 DNA was extracted from each sample using the Qiagen PowerSoil kit (Qiagen, Hilden, 554 Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions and DNA extracts were stored at -20 °C. 16S 555 rRNA gene libraries were constructed using the universal primers 515F and 806R (Kozich et al., 556 2013) to amplify the V4 region. Amplicons were generated using a high-fidelity Accuprime DNA 557 polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), purified using the AMPure magnetic bead capture 558 kit (Agencourt, Beckman Coulter, MA, USA), and quantified using a QuantIT PicoGreen 559 fluorometric kit (Invitrogen). The purified amplicons were then pooled in equimolar concentrations 560 using a SequalPrep plate normalization kit (Invitrogen), and the final concentration of the library 561 was determined using a SYBR green quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay. Libraries were mixed with 562 Illumina-generated PhiX control libraries and our own genomic libraries and denatured using fresh 563 NaOH. The resulting amplicons were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq V2 (500 cycles).564 Quantitative-PCR565 DNA extraction of membrane filters was performed in a class II microbiological cabinet. 566 Filters were first cut in half (using a heat and UV sterilised scalpel) and sliced into thin ribbons to 567 avoid clustering. DNA extraction was performed using the DNAeasy Powersoil Pro kit (Qiagen, 568 Hilden, Germany) Amplification of the 16S rRNA gene was carried out using the primer pair 569 27fmod (AGRGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG) and 519Rmodbio (GWATTACCGCGGCKGCTG), 570 (Kozich et al. 2013) using a Step One Plus Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, 571 Massachusetts, United States). Each 20 µl qPCR reaction contained: 10 µl of 2X SYBR green 572 master mix, 2 µl ROX reference dye, 0.2 µM forward primer, 0.2 µM reverse primer, 5.6 µl DNA 573 and PCR grade water to 20 µl. The amplification method was as follows: initial 95°C for 5 mins, 574 then 40 cycles of (94°C for 15 seconds and 53°C for 30 seconds), followed by a melt curve. To 575 facilitate absolute quantification of the 16S rRNA gene, DNA extracts from E. coli k12 cells were 576 PCR amplified and ran on an agarose gel, with product bands cut out and weighed for DNA 577 extraction, using the Monarch Gel Extraction kit (New England Biolabs, Massachusetts, United 578 States). DNA concentration (ng µl-1) and purity (A260/280nm) were determined via the use of a 579 nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, United States). Gene copy 580 number was determined using the following equation: (Amount of DNA (ng) x 6.022 x1023)/(Gene 581 Length (bp)x 1 x 109 x 660), where 6.022 x1023 represents Avogadro’s Constant, 1 x109 a 582 conversion factor, and 660 is the average mass of 1 base pair (bp). A 1 in 10 serial dilution was 583 then performed to generate 16S rRNA standards containing known gene copy numbers ranging 584 from 1x107 to 1x101, which were run alongside air sample DNA and plotted to generate a standard 585 curve, facilitating the quantification of 16S rRNA gene copies in each sample.586 Bioinformatic processing587 The resulting amplicons were processed using the DADA2 pipeline (Callahan et al., 2016). 588 Forward and reverse read pairs were trimmed and filtered, with forward reads truncated at 230 bp 589 and reverse reads at 200 bp, no ambiguous bases allowed, and each read required to have <2 590 expected errors based on their quality scores. Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were 591 independently inferred from the forward and reverse reads of each sample using the run-specific 592 error rates. Reads were dereplicated, pairs were merged, and chimeras were removed from each 593 sample. Taxonomic assignment was performed against the SILVA v138 database (Quast et al., 594 2012, Yilmaz et al., 2014) using the implementation of the RDP (ribosomal database project) naive 595 Bayesian classifier (Wang et al., 2007). The decontam package (Davis et al., 2018) was used to 596 identify potential contaminants using the prevalence function. The ASV table was also manually 597 curated to discard ASVs present in the kit and MiSeq controls in higher abundance than in other 598 samples, leaving 107 samples (± 19032 reads/sample) with 1013 assigned ASVs. 599 Global database600 We produced a global 16S rRNA database of marine, soil and air samples using data 601 extracted from NCBI and based on studies using the primer set 515F-806R sequenced on Miseq 602 (Fig. S1, Table S3, ASV and taxonomy tables are available on FigShare). Each dataset from 603 individual studies was analysed separately using the DADA2 pipeline to independently calculate 604 the error rate and infer ASVs. Three types of datasets were encountered but all were processed with 605 the same criteria as the ACE samples, unless specified. Datasets with paired end reads (forward and 606 reverse) or datasets with forward reads only but with the same amplicon length as paired-end reads 607 were treated with the same criteria as the ACE samples. A few of the older datasets had forward 608 reads only with smaller amplicons and were truncated to 100 bp before proceeding with the DADA2 609 pipeline.610 The unique ASV tables and the final ACE table were merged using the 611 mergeSequenceTables function in DADA2 and identical ASVs were merged using the 612 collapseNoMismatch function in DADA2 with a minimum overlap of 90 bp, to ensure merging of 613 ASVs with different amplicon lengths. Only ASVs present in at least two samples were conserved. 614 Taxonomic assignment was performed against the SILVA v138 database (Quast et al., 2012, 615 Yilmaz et al., 2014) using the implementation of the RDP naive Bayesian classifier (Wang et al., 616 2007). 617 Statistical analyses 618 All statistical analyses were performed in the R environment using primarily a combination 619 of the phyloseq (McMurdie & Holmes, 2013) and vegan (Dixon, 2003), and visualised using 620 ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016). 621 For the global comparison, alpha diversity of all samples was computed in phyloseq with 622 the plot_richness function and ANOVA with Tukey’s honest significant difference (HSD) tests 623 were used to compare differences between sample types. Linear models with second order 624 polynomials were used to evaluate latitudinal associations with alpha diversity. For beta diversity, 625 sample counts were transformed to proportions, the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix was computed 626 and visualised using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). A PERMANOVA with the 627 adonis function was used compare beta diversity between sample types.628 Focusing on the Southern Ocean air (ACE expedition) samples, we compared marine air, 629 terrestrial air and precipitation samples. Alpha diversity was computed with the plot_richness 630 function and was compared between sample types using ANOVA with Tukey’s honest significant 631 difference (HSD) tests. Linear regressions were computed to evaluate relationships between 632 environmental variables and alpha diversity. We also used random forest models to identify the 633 most important variables associated with the alpha diversity of air communities. The random forest 634 (RF) models were computed using the rfPermute function with 5000 permutations and 5000 trees 635 in the rfPermute package (Archer & Archer, 2020). For beta diversity, sample counts were 636 transformed to proportions, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix was computed and visualised using 637 non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). A PERMANOVA with the adonis function was 638 used compare beta diversity between sample types and to identify associations with environmental 639 variables. The ps_euler function from the MicEco (Russel, 2020) package was used to identify 640 shared ASVs between groups of interests and produce venn diagrams. 641 Finally, we used the FEAST package (Shenhav et al., 2019) for the source tracking analysis. 642 To identify the potential origin of Antarctic air ASVs, we used the global database as sources of 643 ASVs and the ACE samples as sink. Differences between source origin and Southern Ocean sample 644 types were tested with ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD tests. Finally, the ps_euler function was used to 645 identify the potential aerobiome shared between the Southern Ocean and global air samples. 646647648 References649650 Amato P, Joly M, Besaury L, Oudart A, Taïb N, Moné AI, Deguillaume L, Delort A-M & Debroas 651 D (2017) Active microorganisms thrive among extremely diverse communities in cloud water.

We propose that recent adaptation within the native range, in particular adaptations to human-altered habitat, could also contribute to the evolution of invasive populations. Populations adapted to human-altered habitats in the native range are likely to increase in abundance within areas frequented by humans and associated with human transport mechanisms, thus enhancing the likelihood of transport to a novel range. Given that habitats are altered by humans in similar ways worldwide, as evidenced by global environmental homogenization, propagules from populations adapted to human-altered habitats in the native range should perform well within similarly human-altered habitats in the novel range.

Anthropogenically induced adaptation to invade hypothesis,12955015,Adaptations of phytophagous insects on invasive host plant species,,Norda L.J.,2011,"Since humans have started travelling and colonizing new areas they have brought animals and plants along with them, introducing them into new environments. Sometimes these introductions happened intentional; livestock, garden plants and crops for example, but sometimes they happened unintentional for example, rats and plant seeds. This human-influenced geographic shuffling of organisms is probably the most biologically dynamic of anthropogenic ‘global change’ phenomena (Carroll, 2007b). A lot of these introduced species do not survive or reproduce in their new habitats due to unsuitable conditions, or are outcompeted by native species and do not become established. Some species however, have managed to become established. This is especially the case in disturbed habitats (Davis et al., 2000; Rejmanek et al., 2004). Disturbed habitats lose constituent species and nonnative species can become established by accessing the resources left unused by these constituent species (Fargione & Tilman, 2005; Levine et al., 2004), or because the nonnative species are better adapted to disturbed habitats than the native species (Burke & Grime, 1996; Strauss et al., 2006b). Another factor determining whether a nonnative species becomes established is whether they can escape natural enemies in ways that give them a competitive advantage over native species (Colautti et al., 2004; Joshi & Vrieling, 2005; Stastny et al., 2005). Therefore whether a nonnative species becomes established depends on both the ecological circumstances of the habitat and the genetic variability of the introduced species (Carroll, 2007b). If established populations of a nonnative species grow and spread due to successful reproduction and recruitment of subsequent generations into the breeding population, that species may become prominent in the native biota or ‘invasive’ (Parker et al., 1999; Richardson et al., 2000). Invasive species may even become dominant to native populations (Crooks, 2002; Davis & Thompson, 2000).",,,,,

Despite this growing body of empirical evidence, there is still a need to develop the theoretical background of invasions with adaptation.Speciﬁcally,thei mpact of mating system on the dynamics of adaptation during invasion of a new environment remains only partially understood. Here, we analyze a simulation demo-genetic model of bioinvasion accounting for partial asexuality rates. We simulate two levels of recurrent immigration from a source population at mutation–drift–selection equilibrium to a new empty environment with a different adaptive landscape (black-holesink). Adaptation relies on a quantitative trait coded explicitly by10 lociunder mutation, selection and genetic drift. Using this model, we conﬁrm previous results on the positive effects on invasiveness of migration, mutation and similarity of local phenotypic optima. We further show how the invasion dynamics of the introduced population is affected by the rate of asexuality. Purely asexual species have lower invasion success in terms of probability and time to invasion than species with other matingsystems. Among species with mixed mating systems, the greatest invasiveness is observed for species with high asexual rates. We suggest that this pattern is due to inﬂated genetic variance in the source population through the Hill-Robertson effect (i.e., clonal interference). An interesting consequence is that species with the highest genetic load in their source environment have greatest invasiveness in the new environment",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/article, Journal articles","adaptation, genetic load, niche evolution, invasiveness, mating system, Hill-Robertson effect, source-sink dynamics, clonal interference, [SDV.SA]Life Sciences [q-bio]/Agricultural sciences, [SDV.BA]Life Sciences [q-bio]/Animal biology, [SDV.BDD]Life Sciences [q-bio]/Development Biology, [SDE.BE]Environmental Sciences/Biodiversity and Ecology",,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC'

Increasingly, efforts are being made to interrelate or even synthesize the growing number of hypotheses in order to gain a more comprehensive and integrative understanding of invasions. We argue that adopting an eco-evolutionary perspective on invasions is a promising approach to achieve such integration. It emphasizes the evolutionary antecedents of invasions, i.e. the species’ evolutionary legacy and its role in shaping novel biotic interactions that arise due to invasions. We present a conceptual framework consisting of five hypothetical scenarios about the influence of so-called ‘eco-evolutionary experience’ in resident native and invading non-native species on invasion success, depending on the type of ecological interaction (predation, competition, mutualism, and commensalism). We show that several major ecological invasion hypotheses, including ‘enemy release’, ‘EICA’, ‘novel weapons’, ‘naïve prey’, ‘new associations’, ‘missed mutualisms’ and ‘Darwin’s naturalization hypothesis’ can be integrated into this framework by uncovering their shared implicit reference to the concept of eco-evolutionary experience. We draft a routine for the assessment of eco-evolutionary experience in native and non-native species using a food web-based example and propose two indices (xpFocal index and xpResidents index) for the actual quantification of eco-evolutionary experience.

Empirical studies show divergent impacts of alien populations on ecosystems and contrasting effects of biotic and abiotic factors on the dynamics of alien populations, which hinders the creation of a unified theory of biological invasions. Compounding these issues is the plethora of hypotheses that aim to explain invasion success, which can be unclear and contradictory. We propose a synthesis that categorizes hypotheses along a timeline of invasion. We sorted invasion hypotheses along the invasion timeline, and considered population, community and ecosystem levels. This temporal sorting of invasion concepts shows that each is relevant at a specific stage of the invasion. Although concepts and empirical findings on alien species may appear contradictory, when mapped onto an invasion timeline, they may be combined in a complementary way.

Understanding the factors underlying establishment and spread of exotic species in order to predict invasion risks is a major goal in invasion biology. Many theoretical studies investigated the ecological and evolutionary components of these factors and their impact on the invasive process. Yet, hypothesis tests through experimental approaches are still scarce because of the practical and ethical difficulties associated with the introduction of exotic species in nature. Thus, most empirical results come from a posteriori analyses of fortuitous invasions, which allow correlative approaches at best and give no information about invasion failures. In this paper, we propose microcosms, i.e. reproducible controlled simplified environments, as an alternative to experimental introductions in natura. From a review of the literature, we discuss the distinctive features of microcosms to test theoretical predictions about invasion. Our analysis focuses on studies involving populations in transitory dynamics after a demographic bottleneck and/or subject to an adaptive challenge, two key characteristics of invasive processes. Despite their small number, these studies have been used successfully to explore the influences of various factors, mainly related to the introduction site characteristics (its abiotic conditions and their spatial and temporal heterogeneity), and to a lesser extent to the introduced individuals themselves (propagule pressure, genetic diversity and adaptations in the introduced population) or the invaded community. We argue that microcosms, as model systems, can be powerful tools to test theoretical hypotheses. They must however be used with care, as they do not account for the same complexity as natural systems. They are thus complementary to theoretical studies and field surveys, and contribute to reinforce the predictive value of invasion biology by linking theory and experimentation",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/article, Journal articles","[SDV]Life Sciences [q-bio], [SDE]Environmental Sciences",,HAL CCSD

However, conditions during transport – an early stage of the invasion – can be particularly harsh, thereby greatly reducing the size of a population available to establish in a new region. Some successful non‐indigenous species are more tolerant of environmental and anthropogenic stressors than related native species, possibly stemming from selection (ie survival of only pre‐adapted individuals for particular environmental conditions) during the invasion process. By reviewing current literature concerning population genetics and consequences of selection on population fitness, we propose that selection acting on transported populations can facilitate local adaptation, which may result in a greater likelihood of invasion than predicted by propagule pressure alone.

However, invasion frameworks generally do not consider reciprocal interactions between non-native species and people. Non-native species can shape human actions via beneficial or detrimental ecological and socioeconomic effects and people, in turn, shape invasions through their movements, behaviour and how they respond to the collection, transport, introduction and spread of non-natives. The feedbacks that stem from this 'coupled human and natural system' (CHANS) could therefore play a key role in mitigating (i.e. negative feedback loops) or exacerbating (i.e. positive feedback loops) ongoing and future invasions. We posit that the invasion process could be subdivided into three CHANS that span from the source region from which non-natives originate to the recipient region in which they establish and spread. We also provide specific examples of feedback loops that occur within each CHANS that have either reduced or facilitated new introductions and spread of established non-native species. In so doing, we add to exisiting invasion frameworks to generate new hypotheses about human-based drivers of biological invasions and further efforts to determine how ecological outcomes feed back into human actions",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/article, publication-article",coupled human and natural systems coupled social-ecological systems feedback loop invasive negative feedback non-native positive feedback,,Pensoft Publishers

Anthropogenically induced adaptation to invade hypothesis,45557469,How do native species respond to invaders? Mechanistic and trait-based perspectives,10.1007/s10530-015-0874-7,"Berthon, Katherine",2015,"Adaptive responses of native species are important in enabling their persistence in the face of unprecedented biotic exchange. In the present paper I discuss how native species respond to invasive species both from a mechanistic and trait-based perspective. An earlier review by Strauss et al. (Ecol Lett 9:357–374, 2006) discussed a conceptual model of native species evolution in which the likelihood of an evolutionary response to an invader is dependent upon the strength of the selective pressure imposed (degree of variation in fitness between genotypes) and the adaptive capacity of the native (extent of pre-adaptation or genetic diversity). I aim to update and build upon this framework in light of new information on the interaction of phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary processes in adaptive responses of native species. Phenotypic plasticity can be a precursor to or an inhibitor of evolutionary responses and, under conditions of strong selection, phenotypic plasticity may enable adaptation where natives have a low evolutionary capacity. Based on current evidence, it is likely that phenotypic plasticity is the first front in native species adaptation, after which genetic changes occur via a genetic accommodation mechanism. Lastly, I review the literature on behavioural, morphological, physiological and life history trait changes of responding native species in light of this framework. Knowledge of the genetic and physiological underpinnings of adaptive responses in native species is limited and would aid in distinguishing the contributions of phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary change in future studies.13 page(s",,journal article,"Evolution, Invasion, Native species, Phenotypic plasticity, Response",Biological Invasions,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC'
Anthropogenically induced adaptation to invade hypothesis,587086157,"Climate change and biological invasions: evidence, expectations, and response options",10.1111/brv.12282,"Hulme, Philip",2016,"A changing climate may directly or indirectly influence biological invasions by altering the likelihood of introduction or establishment, as well as modifying the geographic range, environmental impacts, economic costs or management of alien species. A comprehensive assessment of empirical and theoretical evidence identified how each of these processes is likely to be shaped by climate change for alien plants, animals and pathogens in terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments of Great Britain. The strongest contemporary evidence for the potential role of climate change in the establishment of new alien species is for terrestrial arthropods, as a result of their ectothermic physiology, often high dispersal rate and their strong association with trade as well as commensal relationships with human environments. By contrast, there is little empirical support for higher temperatures increasing the rate of alien plant establishment due to the stronger effects of residence time and propagule pressure. The magnitude of any direct climate effect on the number of new alien species will be small relative to human-assisted introductions driven by socioeconomic factors. Casual alien species (sleepers) whose population persistence is limited by climate are expected to exhibit greater rates of establishment under climate change assuming that propagule pressure remains at least at current levels. Surveillance and management targeting sleeper pests and diseases may be the most cost-effective option to reduce future impacts under climate change. Most established alien species will increase their distribution range in Great Britain over the next century. However, such range increases are very likely be the result of natural expansion of populations that have yet to reach equilibrium with their environment, rather than a direct consequence of climate change. To assess the potential realised range of alien species will require a spatially explicit approach that not only integrates bioclimatic suitability and population-level demographic rates but also simulation of landscape-level processes (e.g. dispersal, land-use change, host/habitat distribution, non-climatic edaphic constraints). In terms of invasive alien species that have known economic or biodiversity impacts, the taxa that are likely to be the most responsive are plant pathogens and insect pests of agricultural crops. However, the extent to which climate adaptation strategies lead to new crops, altered rotations, and different farming practices (e.g. irrigation, fertilization) will all shape the potential agricultural impacts of alien species. The greatest uncertainty in the effects of climate change on biological invasions exists with identifying the future character of new species introductions and predicting ecosystem impacts. Two complementary strategies may work under these conditions of high uncertainty: (i) prioritise ecosystems in terms of their perceived vulnerability to climate change and prevent ingress or expansion of alien species therein that may exacerbate problems; (ii) target those ecosystem already threatened by alien species and implement management to prevent the situation deteriorating under climate change",,Journal Article,"biosecurity, exotic, globalisation, non-native, pathways, species distribution models, weed, Animals, Ecosystem, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Introduced Species, United Kingdom, Animals, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Ecosystem, Introduced Species, United Kingdom",Biological Reviews,Wiley on behalf of the Cambridge Philosophical Society

They are commonly discussed in the context of the ecological perturbations or the human activities that permitted the invasion. There is also evidence, that there is an intrinsic component to biological invasions in that evolutionary changes of the invaders themselves can facilitate or limit invasions (Lee 2002; Urban et al. 2007; Van Bocxlaer et al. 2010). Hence, teasing apart whether environmental change or changes of the organism foster invasions is an interesting field of research. Ample evidence for plants and animals documents that ecological change and human activities trigger range expansions and invasions, but questions regarding evolutionary change of invaders remain less explored although there are several reasons to believe it matters. Firstly, rapid evolutionary change is possible in timeframes relevant for contemporary biological invasions (Hendry et al. 2007). Furthermore, population genetic modelling suggests that there are circumstances where the range expansion and colonization of empty spaces in the course of an invasion can induce evolutionary change in a way that is specific to invaders: the process of repeated founding out of marginal populations in the course of a range expansion can shift allele frequencies and has been referred to as allele surfing, which not only affects neutral genetic variance, but also fitness relevant traits (Klopfstein et al. 2006; Travis et al. 2007; Burton & Travis 2008). Importantly, this process poses a null model for evolutionary inference in invasive populations. It predicts conspicuous allele frequency changes in an expanding metapopulation unless migration homogenizes the gene pool. Despite this relevance, ideas about allele surfing rely heavily on modelling although some experimental evidence comes from studies that document the segregation of genetic variants in growing plaques of bacteria (Hallatschek et al. 2007). To date, little empirical data is available that would reveal the migration processes that affect the establishment of gene pools at invasion fronts in natural systems. This aspect sets the study of Bronnenhuber et al. (2011) apart. They quantify migration behind the expansion front of an invading fish and thus provide important baseline data for the interpretation of the emerging patterns of genetic differentiation",,info:eu-repo/semantics/article,,,'Wiley'

An important process is that during each step of the introduction,  a subset of individuals may be selected. My question in this essay is whether the introduction process would cause behavioral and/or genetic change through a series of selective processes. The initial introduction stages act as a bottleneck, reducing genetic diversity relative to the original population. Invasive Argentine ants show reduced intraspecific aggression, but it is unclear if this change is an adaptation. Invasive cane toads evolve to disperse at a faster rate.   However, there is not enough research available of this subject to proof any patterns. Biological invasions are highly complex and unique, and make it hard to discover any patterns.",,,,,

Theory in ecology and evolution often relies on the analysis of invasion processes, and general approaches exist to understand the early stages of an invasion. However, predicting the long-term transformations of communities following an invasion remains a challenging endeavour. 2. We propose a general analytical method that uses both resident community and invader dynamical features to predict whether an invasion causes large long-term impacts on the invaded community. 3. This approach reveals a direction in which classic invasion analysis, based on initial invasion growth rate, can be extended. Indeed, we explain how the density dependence of invasion growth, if properly defined, synthetically encodes the long-term biotic transformations caused by an invasion, and therefore predicts its ultimate outcome. This approach further clarifies how the density dependence of the invasion growth rate is as much a property of the invading population as it is one of the invaded community. 4. Our theory applies to any stable community model, and directs us towards new questions that may enrich the toolset of invasion analysis, and suggests that indirect interactions and dynamical stability are key determinants of invasion outcomes.Funding Agencies|H2020 European Research Council [666971]; Agence Nationale de la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR)European Commission [ANR-10-LABX-41]; VetenskapsradetSwedish Research Council [VR-2017-05245]; Irish Research CouncilIrish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology [IRCLA/2017/186]</p",,"Article in journal, info:eu-repo/semantics/article, text","adaptive dynamics; alternative stable states; coexistence; ecological stability; extinctions; feedback loops; invasion fitness; press perturbation, Ecology, Ekologi",,'Wiley'

Here, we review the potential for rapid adaptation from standing genetic variation and from new mutations, and examine four types of evolutionary change that might promote or constrain rapid adaptation during the invasion process.

Evolutionary changes may occur followingintroduction into a remote new location, as an evolutionaryresponse to new biotic and/or abiotic pressures (Sakai et al. 2001;Cox 2004), hereafter called ‘post-introduction adaptation scenario’.Hence, evolutionary changes should occur independently at eacharea of introduction. For example, the invasive marine copepodEurytemora affinis has adapted to freshwater habitats independentlyseveral times, with the advent of ballast water shipping and dis-charge into freshwater lakes on several continents (Lee 1999). Twoalternative eco-evolutionary invasion scenarios have also recentlybeen proposed to account for the invasiveness of some populations.First, adaptation may occur at a primary site of invasion, with otherterritories subsequently invaded from this site, a scenario recentlycalled the ‘bridgehead scenario’ (Lombaert et al. 2010). Adaptivechanges may thus occur only once, at the bridgehead locality. Theadaptive changes occurring at this site may overcome biotic and/orabiotic barriers to invasion, thereby facilitating subsequent establish-ment following dispersal to other biogeographical areas with selec-tive pressures similar to those at the bridgehead. Alternatively, keyevolutionary changes for the invasion may occur within the nativerange, before dispersal into the introduced range (Bossdorf et al.2008; Hufbauer et al. 2012). This scenario has recently beendescribed as ‘two-step’ (Foucaud et al. 2009) or anthropogenicallyinduced adaptation to invade (AIAI) when this prior adaptationrelates to the alteration of habitats by humans (Hufbauer et al.2012). Hereafter, we used the term ‘prior-adaptation’, sometimesalso called ‘pre-adaptation’, to refer to this scenario (see Hufbaueret al. 2012 for arguments supporting the term prior-adaptation).Unravelling the eco-evolutionary scenarios leading to the emer-gence of invasive populations has important implications both forinvasion theory, to improve our understanding of the circumstancesfavouring adaptive changes during invasion, and for managementpolicies, as it may guide actions for preventing or controlling inva-sions. However, substantial amounts of information are required todistinguish between eco-evolutionary invasion scenarios and thisinformation has proved difficult to obtain (Hufbauer et al. 2012).The information required includes (1) phenotypic data for bothnative and introduced populations, to determine whether adaptationoccurred during invasion, (2) genetic data for documenting thegenetic relationship between native and invasive populations andretracing the invasion route and (3) environmental data (abioticand/or biotic) to assess the selection pressures acting in both nativeand introduced populations.

Genetic tools have also been used to decipher complex inva-sion histories (e.g. Lombaert et al. 2010; Ascunce et al. 2011).Species distribution models (SDM) have been used to identify eco-logical niche shifts associated with invasion (e.g. Broennimann et al.2007). Recently, Lachmuth et al. (2010) highlighted the benefit ofcombining climatic data with neutral genetic analyses to shed lighton the genetic and ecological mechanisms contributing to the inva-siveness of populations. However, to our knowledge, experimental,genetic and SDM approaches have never been applied simulta-neously to the same species for unambiguous determination of theeco-evolutionary scenario of an invasion.We conducted an integrative study combining experimental,genetic and SDM approaches, to determine which of the three eco-evolutionary invasion scenarios cited above was responsible for therecent invasion of a Mediterranean region (i.e. Israel; Vonshak et al.2010) by the tropical ant Wasmannia auropunctata. We first used SDManalyses to identify geographical regions in which native and/orinvasive populations of W. auropunctata were subject to cold-temper-ature selection pressures similar to those in Israel. We then con-ducted a worldwide genetic analysis based on mitochondrial andmicrosatellite markers, to determine the genetic origin of the Israelilineage, focusing on populations established in the candidate geo-graphical areas identified in our SDM analysis. Finally, we con-ducted laboratory experiments to compare the response to coldstress of workers from Israeli populations and workers from a largeset of populations from the native and introduced ranges, takinginto account the results obtained with the other two approaches(i.e. SDM and genetic analyses). This integrative approach allowedto test (1) whether the establishment of W. auropunctata populationsin Israel was accompanied by an adaptation of workers to local coldtemperature and (2) whether this adaptation occurred within theintroduced range in Israel (i.e. post-introduction adaptation sce-nario), or before transportation to Israel, either at a primary site ofinvasion (i.e. bridgehead scenario) or in particular habitats withinthe native range (i.e. prior-adaptation scenario).MATERIALS AND METHODSStudy speciesWasmannia auropunctata originates from the neotropic ecozone, fromnorthern Argentina to Mexico (Wetterer & Porter 2003), and dis-plays two types of populations within its native range. Ancestralnative populations are confined to tropical primary forests, occupy-ing naturally disturbed areas (e.g. floodplains), and are characterisedby low nest and worker densities (Wetterer & Porter 2003; Orivelet al. 2009). Some populations have repeatedly invaded human-modified habitats within the native range (e.g. road sides, planta-tions; Orivel et al. 2009). This change of habitat within the nativerange is associated with a major ecological shift, with high workerand nest densities (Orivel et al. 2009) and a genetic shift in thereproductive system, from a haplo–diploid sexual model to clonallyreproducing queens and males (Foucaud et al. 2007, 2009).Since the beginning of the 20th century, W. auropunctata hasinvaded many countries in tropical and subtropical zones (Wetterer& Porter 2003; Foucaud et al. 2010). In its introduced range, theinvasive populations settle in human-altered habitats and displayseveral traits similar to those of the clonal populations from thenative area (i.e. ecological dominance and clonality; Foucaud et al.2010). In 2005, established populations of W. auropunctata were iden-tified in Israel, in the Mediterranean zone, which is characterised byclimatic features, including colder winter temperatures, very differ-ent from those in the tropical core habitat (Vonshak et al. 2010).Despite these contrasted abiotic conditions, the Israeli populationsdisplay nesting and foraging behaviour similar to that observed intropical and subtropical areas (Vonshak et al. 2010). The ability offoraging workers to cope with cold winter temperatures suggeststhat the Israeli population may have undergone adaptation to coldtemperatures, allowing it to invade this new biogeographical area.Species distribution modelling analysesWe used the ‘domain’ algorithm (Carpenter et al. 1993) to modelthe distribution of W. auropunctata on the basis of 88 georeferencedoccurrences in Israel. The occurrences are widely distributed inIsrael (Fig. 1b) and hence are likely to represent most of the cli-matic range that W. auropunctata may potentially encounter in thisregion. Half these occurrences were used for model fitting, theother half being used for model evaluation. The climate data studiedincluded four variables describing the cold-temperature conditionstypical of the habitats occupied in Israel: the minimum temperatureof the coldest month, the mean temperature of the coldest quarter,the annual mean temperature and the annual temperature range(available from the WORLDCLIM database; Hijmans et al. 2005).Data were managed using GIS GRASS software (GRASS Develop-ment Team 2008), interfaced with R via the R packages spgrass6(Bivand 2011) and raster (Hijmans & van Etten 2010). Models werefitted and evaluated using the R package dismo (Hijmans et al.2010).We evaluated the performance of the models for the Israeliregion, by comparing model predictions with observations, by calcu-lating the area under the curve (AUC) of a receiver operating char-acteristics plot (Fielding & Bell 1997). As only data for occurrenceswere available, pseudoabsences were generated at random for thegeographical region over which the model was defined (Fig. 1b).The domain algorithm yielded a model that was ultimately used toidentify geographical regions worldwide with similar climatic condi-tions and in which W. auropunctata populations had previously beenreported.This above simple method was used because it shows a low riskof overfitting the data and hence a robust transferability to otherremote geographical regions (Carpenter et al. 1993). We neverthelessconducted a complementary analysis based on the multivariate envi-ronmental similarity surface (MESS) approach (Elith et al. 2010; seeAppendix S1 in supporting information). Because species distribu-tion models assume that records represent a species at equilibriumwith its environment, which is rarely verified in invasive species, wealso conducted further MESS analyses simulating pseudo-equilib-rium of W. auropunctata distribution with climate, in the geographicalregion of Israel (Appendix S2).Genetic analysesUsing mitochondrial and microsatellite data, we conducted phylo-geographical genetic analyses to investigate the branching positionof Israeli individuals within a large set of samples from tropical/© 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRSLetter Cold adaptation of an invasive ant 1267subtropical native and invasive populations (Figure SS1). DNA wasextracted and purified from all individuals analysed, by a standardCTAB (hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide)-based protocol.Mitochondrial dataWe amplified a 700–710 bp fragment of the mitochondrial COI(cytochrome oxidase I) gene from 136 individuals (83 workers and 53queens), with two sets of primers (Appendix S3). In total, 123 ofthese individuals originated from 31 native and 20 introduced popu-lations in the tropical/subtropical zone; the other 13 individuals(five queens and eight workers) originated from seven nests in Israel(Figure SS1). Two sequences from the closely related speciesWasmannia rochai were used as an outgroup.Our phylogeographical analyses were performed on unique haplo-types (35 in total). Sequences were partitioned into codon positions(cp) and models of evolution were independently selected for fivesets of partitions (first cp; second cp; third cp; first/second cp;first/second/third cp). This was achieved by comparing Akaike’sinformation criteria corrected for samples of small size (i.e. AICc,Posada & Buckley 2004 and references therein) in JMODELTEST(Posada 2008). Relationships between W. auropunctata haplotypeswere then constructed by Bayesian inference, with MRBAYESv3.1.2 (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003). Three distinct partitioningstrategies (PS) were used (unpartitioned analysis, one partition percp, one partition for first/second cp + one partition for third cp).For each PS, two independent runs were carried out, for 20 milliongenerations each, with eight Markov chains. The best PS was thenidentified by comparing Bayes’ factors (Kass & Raftery 1995) andthe corresponding tree was constructed with a conservative burn-inof 25%. Node support was estimated from posterior probabilities(i.e. the proportion of post burn-in trees recovering a particularclade; Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003).More specifically, we evaluated the robustness of the affiliation ofthe Israeli haplotype to clade B (see results). We constrained theposition of the Israeli haplotype by forcing it into the other clade(i.e. clade A), using the settings for the best PS. We then used Ba-yes’ factors to determine whether there was significantly less statisti-cal support for the constrained analysis than for the unconstrainedanalysis.Microsatellite dataIn W. auropunctata clonal populations, the nuclear genomes ofqueens and males behave as two independent lineages (Fournieret al. 2005a; Foucaud et al. 2007). We therefore carried out microsat-(a)(b) (c)(d) (e)Figure 1 (a) Geographical regions where the DOMAIN model was fitted; (b) in the region of Israel (black circles are W. auropunctata distribution records); (c) within thenative range and surrounding invaded areas and (d–e) in regions outside the native range in which invasive W. auropunctata populations have been reported (red zones).The colour legend indicated in (c) corresponds to a measure of climatic similarity relative to the niche envelop of W. auropunctata defined in Israel based on the Gowermetric. The native range of W. auropunctata, is surrounded by a green strip in (c). Results of model fitting for the tropical islands of Hawaii and Tahiti, where W.auropunctata is established, are not shown because these islands displayed no climatic similarities to Israel.© 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS1268 Olivier Rey et al. Letterellite analyses on the two sexes separately. We added to the data setpublished by Foucaud et al. (2010) additional data including thegenotypes of 12 males and 33 queens from seven populations sam-pled from Argentina. A global data set of 453 male and 1093 queengenotypes was analysed in this study. For sites from which no maleswere sampled, we analysed the spermatheca content of the queens,when possible (see Fournier et al. 2005a). All individuals were geno-typed at 12 microsatellite loci (Fournier et al. 2005b). Dendrogramswere constructed from individual genotypes with the neighbour-joining algorithm (Saitou & Nei 1987) and a variant of Chakrabortyand Jin’s allele shared distance (Chakraborty & Jin 1993; seeFournier et al. 2005a).Laboratory experimentsSampled populationsWe sampled a total of 15 W. auropunctata populations (Table 1). Afirst set of twelve populations was used to check whether coldadaptation occurred in Israeli populations during invasion: (1) sixpopulations from the native tropical area corresponding to the corehabitat, with three populations from natural habitats (i.e. primaryforest) and three populations from human-modified habitats (i.e.plantation or roadside) and (2) six populations from the invasiverange, two populations from the tropical zone and four populationsfrom the Mediterranean zone (Israel). A second set of three popula-tions was used to determine more specifically the site of adaptation,based on the results of SDM and genetic analyses (see Results): (1)two populations from Zarate (Buenos Aires province, Argentina), azone located at the southern margin of the native range and (2) onepopulation from Florida, corresponding to a subtropical zone of theintroduced range. All but the two Argentinean populations werereared and studied at the CBGP laboratory (Montpellier, France).The two populations from Argentina were reared and studied at theSABCL laboratory (Buenos Aires, Argentina) due to strong legalrestrictions on the importation of live W. auropunctata from Argen-tina to Europe. In both laboratories, ants were reared in a walk-inclimatic chamber maintained at constant temperature and humidity(25 °C; 70% RH; L:D 12 : 12) for at least 2 months, to ensure thatall the workers tested in the experiments had been produced in thelaboratory. This time lag minimised both maternal environmentaleffects and the impact of the acclimation factor in the interpretationof our results. During this period, ants were fed ad libitum with ahoney–yeast–water solution and Ephestia eggs.Cold toleranceWe measured survival and time taken by workers to recover fromcold stress (a reversible state of narcosis induced by cold). Survivalis a direct measure of fitness and time taken to recover from chillcoma is an appropriate phenotypic surrogate for the assessment ofcold adaptation in insects (Gibert et al. 2001; Hoffmann et al. 2003).All populations were tested according to the same protocol. Weplaced 50 workers from each population in five sealed and meshedboxes (10 workers per box) and fed them with 0.5 mL of honey–water for 1 h. Workers were then placed in a climatic chamber at2 °C for 16 h. This temperature is close to the lowest absolute min-imum air temperature recorded in the winter months between 1981and 2000 in Tel Aviv (Israel, January: 2.5 °C and February: 2.6 °C,Israeli Meteorological Service). At the end of the cold-stress period,the boxes were placed in a walk-in climatic chamber with standardclimatic conditions (i.e. 25 °C, 70% RH). The proportion of work-ers recovering from cold stress in each box was determined at 11time points: just after the cold shock, after 27, 40 and 60 min, andthen every 30 min until 5 h. This experiment was then repeated forall but the two Argentinean populations tested, giving a total of1400 tested workers (50 workers 9 13 populations 9 2 runs at theCBGP and 50 workers 9 2 populations at the SABCL).We investigated the response of workers to cold stress as a func-tion of six biogeographical origins defined on the basis of the fol-lowing three criteria: native vs. introduced, climatic range (tropical,subtropical or Mediterranean), and natural vs. human-modified habi-tats. As not all population combinations exist in the field (e.g. intro-duced populations in natural habitats) we ended up with sixbiogeographical origins: tropical native area in natural habitat, tropi-cal native area in human-modified habitat, tropical-introduced zone,subtropical introduced zone (i.e. Florida), subtropical native mar-ginal zone (i.e. Argentina) and Mediterranean-introduced area (i.e.Israel). For each of these six origins, we investigated the relation-ship between the proportion of workers that had recovered and thetime since cold stress, by fitting a non-linear mixed model (nlme)according to a reparameterised Gompertz relationship implementedusing R statistical software (R Development Core Team 2010), witha mean function defined as follows:fðxÞ ¼ plateau  expðexpðc  ðd  xÞÞÞThis model was found to better fit the pattern of worker recoveryfollowing cold stress over the period of observation than a linearmodel for the six biogeographical origins (Appendix S4). Twoparameters, the ‘plateau’ and the parameter ‘d’, corresponding to themaximum proportion of surviving workers and the abscissa at theinflexion point (i.e. a good proxy for the speed with which workersrecovered), respectively, were estimated for each of the six biogeo-graphical origins and compared. Parameter estimates with non-over-lapping confidence intervals were considered to be significantlydifferent. Note that the estimate of ‘time for workers to recover’obtained for the Argentinean populations should be interpretedTable 1 Wasmannia auropunctata populations sampled for laboratory experimentsassessing cold tolerance.

Our predictive analyses across the globaldistribution range of W. auropunctata highlighted a small number ofregions with climatic conditions similar, in terms of coldness, tothose occupied by W. auropunctata in Israel. We identified thenorth-eastern region of Argentina as the largest geographicalregion with similarities to the climatic envelope defined in Israelwithin the native range and the surrounding regions of this species(Fig. 1c). Outside its native range, some regions of North Amer-ica, Australia and Africa also displayed locally similar cold temper-atures (Fig. 1c–e). However, Florida was the only such region inwhich populations of W. auropunctata were reported. This speciesindeed occurs in Africa and Australia, but not under local climateconditions, in term of coldness, similar to those found in Israel(Fig. 1d–e). Similar results were obtained using the MESSapproach (Appendix S1) as well as when considering pseudo-equi-librium of W. auropunctata distribution records with climate(Appendix S2).Genetic analysesOur tree based on the mitochondrial COI contains two main clades:clades A and B (Fig. 2; see also Mikheyev & Mueller 2007). All thepopulations established in Israel were characterised by a unique hap-lotype branching off within clade B. The alternative topology (i.e.Israeli haplotype constrained into clade A) was less supported thanthe best topology obtained (Bayes’ factor = 5.1). Clade B containsother populations located in the southern region of the native range(i.e. haplotypes from North Argentina, Paraguay and southern Bra-zil).The Israeli haplotype was rigorously identical to that found inclonal populations established in Zárate, Buenos Aires province(Argentina C5, Fig. 2 and see map in Appendix SF1) and differedfrom the haplotype of the clonal lineage established in the city ofBuenos Aires by only one nucleotide (Argentina C4, AppendixSF1). The Florida haplotype was assigned to clade A, indicating thatthe Florida and Israeli populations are genetically well differentiated.The microsatellite data obtained for queens and males confirmedthat Israeli populations were established from a single pair of queenand male genotypes reproducing clonally. These clonal genotypeswere strictly identical to those found by Vonshak et al. (2009) insamples collected in 2005. Both the queen and male genotypes fromIsrael were assigned to genetic clusters including only genotypes ofindividuals from Argentina (Fig. 3). For queens, the closest Argen-tinean genotypes were those of individuals from populations estab-lished near Buenos Aires and in the Ocloyas mountain region (C4,C5 and C3; Fig. 3; Figure SS1). The Israeli clonal male lineage hada multilocus haploid genotype remarkably similar to that of clonalmales from Argentinean populations established near Buenos Aires(C5 and C6; Fig. 3). Consistent with phylogeographical results basedon mtDNA analyses, the Israeli queen and male microsatellite geno-types were distantly related to those of populations from Florida(Fig. 3).Cold toleranceWorkers from populations established in Israel survived significantlybetter (plateau = 0.95) and recovered faster (d = 35.67) than workersfrom the tropical native area of both natural habitats (plateau = 0.15;d = 59.01) and human-modified habitats (plateau = 0.35; d = 52.86)and populations established in the tropical-introduced zone(plateau = 0.46; d = 74.95) (Fig. 4b). Workers from the subtropical-introduced zone, (Florida; plateau = 0.79; d = 62.83) and from thesubtropical native marginal zone (Argentina; plateau = 0.91;d = 7.24) also recovered better and faster than all tropical popula-tions. Workers from Israeli populations survived better and recov-ered faster than populations originating from Florida, but did notdo better than Argentinean populations.Additional analyses based on GLMMs revealed similar trends andled to the same main conclusions (Appendix S5).DISCUSSIONEvidence for evolutionary changes during invasionPhysiological adaptations to particular climatic conditions duringinvasion have been demonstrated in various plant species (e.g. Blair& Wolfe 2004; Dlugosch & Parker 2008). However, there is littleempirical evidence of such adaptation in animals (but see Huey et al.2000; Lee et al. 2011). Our study thus provides one of the fewempirical demonstrations that adaptive changes to a physiologicaltrait, cold tolerance in this case, may also lead to the establishmentand facilitate invasion by animal populations. Adaptation to coldallows W. auropunctata workers to continue foraging throughout theyear, even in the winter conditions of the Mediterranean climate ofIsrael, which is harsher than that of the tropical zone. Associatedwith invasive traits characterising all clonal populations (e.g. ecologi-cal dominance), tolerance to cold temperatures thus constitutes akey evolutionary shift crucial for the invasion of W. auropunctatapopulations established in this region.Phenotypic differentiation between the invasive and native popu-lations may also result from stochastic evolutionary change ratherthan adaptive changes in response to particular selection pressures(Keller & Taylor 2008). However, this seems unlikely in the case ofthe invasive Mediterranean populations of W. auropunctata. Indeed,our results indicate that cold tolerance, albeit of lower intensity, hasemerged independently in a genetically different invasive populationestablished in another remote geographical region (i.e. Florida), inresponse to similar cold selection pressure.When and where do evolutionary changes occur during invasionprocesses?This multidisciplinary approach showed that Israeli populationsfollowed a prior-adaptation invasion scenario, with adaptation tocold occurring before long-distance dispersal to Israel in popula-© 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS1270 Olivier Rey et al. Lettertions located at the southern margin of the native distribution ofthe species (i.e. northern Argentina). Israeli populations are geneti-cally similar to populations in northern Argentina, the latter facingwith similar cold selection pressure and displaying similar coldadaptation. On the contrary, the post-introduction adaptation sce-nario is unlikely in the case of W.auropunctata Israeli populations.Indeed, Israeli populations are characterised by only a single cou-ple of queen and male clonal genotypes most probably originatingfrom the same Argentinean population. Moreover, we found noevidence of admixture and/or mutation/recombination events inthe microsatellite multilocus genotypes of reproductives fromIsraeli populations compared to those sampled 5 years before byVonshak et al. (2009). In the same way, the bridgehead scenario isalso unlikely to explain the invasion of W. auropunctata in Israel.The unique cold-tolerant population identified that could haveserve as a bridgehead population for subsequent establishment inIsrael, i.e. Florida, was found to be genetically distinct from theIsraeli population.Figure 2 Consensus tree for the phylogeographical analyses based on mtDNA haplotypes.

See figure SS1 insupplementary information for site names and locations. The closely related species Wasmannia rochai (GenBank accession numbers EF459732 – EF759824) was used asan outgroup.© 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRSLetter Cold adaptation of an invasive ant 1271The nature of the evolutionary change (i.e. adaptive vs. stochastic)that has led to cold-tolerance in Argentinean populations, hence,promoting the establishment and the invasion of at least one inva-sive propagule in Israel, could not be unravelled precisely. Furtherstatistical analyses similar to those implemented by Keller et al.(2009), conducted on a sufficiently large number of populationsestablished in Argentina might be useful to clarify this point. How-ever, because cold tolerance emerged two times independently ingenetically distinct lineages established in a Mediterranean-like cli-mate (i.e. Argentina/Israel and Florida), the most parsimonioushypothesis is that cold tolerance resulted from adaptive changes.Interestingly, Florida most probably followed a scenario of invasiondifferent from the prior-adaption scenario. Although this scenariocannot be determined with the present data, this study supports theview that the invasion of a new environment may be achievedthrough different eco-evolutionary scenarios even at the intraspecificlevel.A role for prior adaptation within or at the margin of a species’native range in the invasion of remote locations by some popula-tions has been suggested in previous studies (e.g. Elton 1958), butlittle convincing evidence for this scenario has been obtained. Ourstudy is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate it unambigu-ously. Consistent with this scenario, the limits of the native rangesof organisms are often viewed as zones of habitat differentiationand heterogeneity, in which diverse evolutionary processes mayoccur (Kirkpatrick & Barton 1997; Thomas et al. 2001). Further-more, the potential to evolve in response to new conditions is likelyto be greater within or at the edge of the native range than in theintroduced range, due to larger effective population sizes, geneticvariation and propagule pressure over evolutionary time scales(Hufbauer et al. 2012).This study challenges the noteworthy small proportion of prior-adaptation suggested in the literature relative to the post-introduc-tion invasion scenario (but see Bossdorf et al. 2008). The scarcity of(a) (b)Figure 3 NJ dendrograms of the microsatellite allele shared distances between individual queens (a) and males (b).

Letterempirical studies unambiguously illustrating the prior adaptationinvasion scenario may reflect a lack of informative data (Hufbaueret al. 2012). More integrative studies, such as that described here,are required to improve our knowledge of the eco-evolutionary sce-narios underlying invasions. A frequent association of prior adapta-tion with invasion in remote locations would provide furtherevidence against the apparent paradox of invasion that some popu-lations characterised by low levels of adaptive genetic diversity areable to adapt to local abiotic conditions in a new habitat (Allendorf& Lundquist 2003).Benefits of a multidisciplinary approach for determiningeco-evolutionary scenarios of invasionMany studies have reported phenotypic divergence between nativeand invasive populations (e.g. Blair & Wolfe 2004; Bossdorf et al.2008), but only a few have carried out genetic analyses to determinethe exact source of invasive populations (but see Xu et al. 2010).This limitation is generally overcome by the comparison of numer-ous samples of native and invasive populations, assuming that thesampled populations broadly reflect the entire niche of the species(Dlugosch & Parker 2008). However, in the absence of preciseknowledge about the genotypes introduced, patterns of adaptivechange within invasive populations must be interpreted with cau-tion, because the use of this approach alone may result in erroneousconclusions. In the case of W. auropunctata, a comparison of theMediterranean invasive populations with arbitrarily sampled tropicalnative populations might have led to the conclusion that adaptationto cold occurred locally after introduction (i.e. following a post-introduction adaptation scenario).Genetic approaches are useful for (1) tracing the route of invasionand, hence, for identifying source populations and (2) highlightingdemographic events associated with invasion processes (see Estoup& Guillemaud 2010 for review). However, genetic tools provide noinformation about whether invasive populations face new selectionpressures and whether evolutionary changes occur during the inva-sion process. For example, Ascunce et al. (2011) used geneticapproaches to demonstrate that invasive populations of the fire ant,Solenopsis invicta, established in Florida behaved as source populationsfrom which propagules dispersed and established new populations inremote locations, such as New Zealand and China. However, itremains unknown whether invasion in these remote locations is asso-ciated with key evolutionary changes within Florida following abridgehead scenario. In W. auropunctata, the use of genetic approachesalone would have led to the identification of the Argentinean popula-tions as the source of invasive populations established in the Mediter-ranean region, but would not have provided any information aboutthe adaptive changes underlying the invasion of these populations.Finally, the species distribution models initially used to predictthe biogeographical invasion potential of some species (Peterson(a) (b)Figure 4 (a) Fits of non-linear mixed models using Gompertz functions for the proportion of workers recovering at each observation time for each of the sixbiogeographical areas. (b) Comparison of Gompertz function parameters estimated for each biogeographical area, for the parameter plateau at the top, and parameter d atthe bottom (see text for details). Closed symbols correspond to populations used to test whether adaptation occurred in the Mediterranean populations compared topopulations established in the core habitat of the native range. Open symbols correspond to the populations used for more specifically studying the location at whichcold adaptation occurred, based on the results obtained in SDM and genetic analyses (see Figs 1, 2 and 3).© 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRSLetter Cold adaptation of an invasive ant 12732003) have recently been used to determine whether and where cli-mate niche shifts occur during invasion (e.g. Broennimann et al.2007; Angetter et al. 2011). These approaches may provide informa-tion about whether invasive populations face new selection pres-sures likely to promote adaptive changes. For instance, Fitzpatricket al. (2007) suggested that some populations of S. invicta originatingfrom the southern margin of the native range of the species invadedcertain sites in the United States at which climatic conditions weresimilar to those of the native range, subsequently colonising colderenvironments within the introduced range. However, these authorsneither identified the source populations giving rise to the invasivepopulations, nor investigated whether and where potential adaptivechanges occurred during the invasion processes. In W. auropunctata,the use of SDM approaches would have suggested that populationsestablished in the Mediterranean zone (i.e. Israel) probably origi-nated from already adapted populations established in Argentina(i.e. margin prior-adaptation scenario) or Florida (i.e. bridgeheadscenario), but would not have made it possible to distinguishbetween these two origins.CONCLUSIONDetermining whether and where adaptive changes occur duringinvasion is challenging. As first suggested by Hufbauer et al.(2012) and demonstrated here, several complementary approachesare required. We propose an efficient and general methodologicalprocedure for focusing more directly on the key populations tobe studied, to decipher unambiguously the eco-evolutionary inva-sion scenario. First, it is important to identify particular selectionpressures within the invasive range that may have induced adap-tive changes to a given phenotypic trait in the introduced popula-tions. Species distribution models can then be used to identifypossible sites at which native and introduced populations facesimilar selection pressures. With the increasing use of SDMapproaches in biology, the available data sets will undoubtedlybecome increasingly appropriate for addressing questions relatingto biological invasions, including adaptation to biotic features (i.e.biotic interactions). Second, genetic approaches are crucial fortracing the route of invasions and identifying the source popula-tions giving rise to invasive populations. Population sampling forgenetic analyses should focus specifically on populations estab-lished within the geographical regions identified by SDM,although other population samples are also required for the analy-sis. Ultimately, phenotypic analyses are required to determinewhether adaptive changes occur during the invasion process.These analyses should be designed so as to include populationsestablished in the native core habitat of the species and popula-tions identified as the potential source population of the targetedinvasive population in genetic and SDM analyses. We believe thatserial processing via these three steps is crucial to determineunequivocally the eco-evolutionary invasion scenario. We hopethat this study will inspire future research on invasive speciesfrom other taxa, thus improving general knowledge concerningbiological invasion processes.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSWe would like to thank R.

(2010).  The MESS analysis was performed using MAXENT (Phillips et al. 2006). The color legend corresponds to the MESS index showing similarity (positive values with higher degree of similarity ranging from green to blue colours) and dissimilarity (negative values with lower degree of similarity from green to yellow colours). Regions in white correspond to regions with MESS values lower than -250, i.e. showing a high degree of dissimilarity with the climatic envelop modeled from 88 distribution records of W. auropunctata in Israel.      Results: According to the MESS analysis, the North-Eastern region of Argentina and Florida display climatic characteristics, in terms of coldness, similar to those of the locations at which W. auropunctata occurs in Israel. To a lower extent, other regions of Mexico and South USA also display locally similar cold temperatures according to the MESS analysis. Yet, no W. auropunctata occurrences are known in these regions.  References: Phillips, S. J., Anderson, R. P., Schapire, R. E. 2006. Maximum entropy modeling of species geographic distributions.

Appendix S2: Projection of the climatic envelop modeled from A) urban areas and populated places in the geographic region of Israel and B) the entire geographic region of Israel (the geographic region defined in the main text, see Figure 1B), in South and Central America according to the multivariate environmental similarity surface approach (MESS) developed  by Elith et al. (2010). The MESS analysis was performed using MAXENT (Phillips et al. 2006). These analyses allowed simulating a situation of pseudo-equilibrium of W. auropunctata distribution with regards to climate in Israel. The first criterion (i.e. urban areas and populated places) was first adopted because W. auropunctata is known to be intimately associated with human-modified habitats in its area of introduction, particularly in Israel (Vonshak et al. 2009). The land-use information allowing defining urban areas and populated places was obtained from the Natural Earth website: http://www.naturalearthdata.com/). The second criterion (overall the geographic region of Israel) was adopted to simulate an extreme (most likely largely overestimated) situation of equilibrium where W. auropunctata is able to settle in the entire geographic region of Israel.  The color legend corresponds to the MESS index showing similarity (positive values with higher degree of similarity ranging from blue to red colours) and dissimilarity (negative values with lower degree of similarity ranging from blue to yellow colours), with the climatic envelop modelled from A) all urban areas and populated places in Israel and B) the entire geographic region of Israel.  Both climatic envelops were projected worldwide and lead to conclusions similar to those found in the manuscript (data not shown).     Results: According to both MESS analyses, the North-Eastern region of Argentina and Florida display climatic characteristics, in terms of coldness, similar to those of A) the urban areas and populated places in Israel and B) the entire geographic region of Israel. To a lower extent, other regions of Mexico and South USA also display locally similar cold temperatures according to the MESS analyses. Yet, no W. auropunctata occurrences are known in these regions.  Appendix S3: Details on the amplification and sequencing protocols of the mitochondrial DNA of cytochrome oxydase (COI) sequences.   LCO and HCO universal primers (Folmer et al. 1994) were used for 97 individual DNA to PCR amplify a 710 bp fragment. However, we did not obtain any PCR product with this set of primer for 39 individuals from several localities (i.e. French Guiana, Guiana, Peru, Brazil, Panama, Surinam, Ecuador, Paraguay, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica and Coco Island). For these individuals, we combined the LCO primer with a new designed internal Reverse primer called newCOI-R (TGY-TGG-TAT-AAA-ATA-GGG-TCT-C) to amplify a 700 pb DNA fragment. For both sets of primers we used the same PCR mixtures as in Foucaud et al. (2007). Thermal cycling conditions were as follows: denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, then 37 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C (48°C for LCO/newCOI-R primer set) for 1 min, and extension at 74 °C for 1 min, followed by a final extension at 74 °C for 10 min. PCR products were purified and sequenced on an ABI 3730 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Individual electropherograms were checked for eventual errors using Seqscape software (Applied Biosystems).

Appendix S5: Details and results of statistical analyses based on general linear mixed models using both the proportion of surviving workers and time to reach half the maximal proportion of recovered workers after cold stress as response variables.   Analytical methods: We assessed the effect of the biogeographic origin of each population on the maximal proportion of surviving workers observed throughout the experiment and the time to reach half the maximal proportion of surviving workers. The maximal proportion of surviving workers in populations was determined regardless of the time at which this maximum was reached. The biogeographic origin of each population was included as a categorical fixed factor (six levels: native area in natural habitats, native area in human-modified habitats, area of introduction in tropical zone, Florida in subtropical zone, Argentina in subtropical zone and area of introduction in the Mediterranean zone), whereas run number and population locality (nested in the “biogeographic origin” factor) were considered as random factors. For the maximal proportion of surviving workers, we used a general linear mixed model to consider binomial error terms and Laplace approximation to estimate parameters. The significance of the fixed factor was assessed in a likelihood ratio test. We used generalized linear mixed models (using GLMER in R) to assess the effect of the origin of each population on the time to reach half the maximal proportion of surviving workers. Gaussian error terms were considered and we used restricted maximum likelihood approximation (REML) to estimate parameters. The significance of the fixed factor was assessed in a likelihood ratio test. We then compared the time taken to reach half the maximal proportion of surviving workers for each origin of populations in Student's t tests.    Results Maximal proportion of surviving workers after cold shock The table below indicates the mean proportions of surviving workers from populations of different biogeographic origins after cold shock at 2°C for 16 hours and the results of the general linear mixed model for populations from the introduced area in the Mediterranean region (Israel) as the baseline level.

Time to reach half the maximal proportion of surviving workers was significantly shorter for Israeli populations (mean = 42.60) than for tropical introduced populations (mean = 111.73, p-value = 1.57x10-6) or populations originating from the native area, whatever the type of habitat (human-modified habitat: mean = 86.87, p-value = 1.82x10-4 or natural habitat: mean = 117.5, p-value = 3.80x10-5). Workers from populations established in Florida (mean = 81.0, p-value = 7.54x10-5) recovered also slower than workers from Israeli populations. It seems that workers from Argentina recovered faster (mean = 14.49) than all populations tested in this study. However,  this result must be interpreted carefully as these Argentinean populations were tested independently at the SABCL laboratory (Buenos Aires, Argentina) and this measure (i.e. time to reach half the maximal proportion of surviving workers after cold stress) is sensible to how workers were considered by observers as recovered.

Wright et al.INTRODUCTIONBehavioral flexibility is employed by many species as an adaptive response tochanging environments. Flexibility in behavior lies at one end of a continuum of plas-tic responses that includes developmental plasticity in individual physiology andanatomy, and genetic responses to selection over generations (DUKAS 1998b; PIGLIUCCI2001; WEST-EBERHARD 2003). Of these forms of response, behavioral changes can gen-erally occur most quickly and thus are best suited for rapid responses to changes inthe external environment. An organism may face such changes due to naturallyoccurring events or to human activities that alter its native habitat. It may also facerapid changes when introduced into a novel habitat by human activities. A variety of fac-tors determine whether an introduced species will be successful in establishing a breedingpopulation in its new habitat, and whether it will become invasive (RICHARDSON et al. 2000;KOLAR & LODGE 2001; COLAUTTI & MACISAAC 2004, REJMÁEK et al. 2005). In this paper wediscuss the role of behavioral flexibility in mediating the establishment success of anorganism introduced into a novel environment, and propose a new model that describeshow the expression of behavioral flexibility may be expected to change through the succes-sive stages of establishment, population growth, and invasion.SOURCES AND CONSEQUENCES OF BEHAVIORAL FLEXIBILITYThe ability of an organism to selectively modify behaviors in response to changingcircumstances may arise from a number of sources. Innate behaviors, or those inde-pendent of experience, may allow individuals to respond to a variety of different stimuli,but these reactions, although perhaps highly tuned, are non-modifiable. Such flexibilityis predicted to be beneficial to the degree that either the cues for, or the timing of,changes are predictable across generations, such as diurnal or seasonal changes in theenvironment, or developmental changes of the animal itself (STEPHENS 1991; DUKAS1998b; SHETTLEWORTH 1998). Most discussions of behavioral flexibility, however, focuson situations where the behavior of individuals is modified by experience (DUKAS1998a; SHETTLEWORTH 1998; READER & LALAND 2003a). In this conception of behavioralplasticity, changes in the behavioral repertoire can result from individual learning inwhich an individual either modifies an existing behavior or invents a new one, termed“innovation” (READER & LALAND 2003b). Changes in behavior can also result from “copy-ing” or other forms of social learning, in which new behavioral variants are learned fromothers (BOYD & RICHERSON 1985; LALAND et al. 1996; READER & LALAND 2003b). Behavio-ral flexibility through either type of learning is predicted to be beneficial when environ-ments change, although social learning may be less advantageous when environmentsvary so rapidly or unpredictably that the information acquired from others is unreliableor outdated (DAWKINS 1980; HARLEY 1981; STEPHENS 1991; DUKAS 1998b; SOL 2003).Individual and social learning differ in their propensity to introduce new behavioralvariants into the repertoire of individuals and populations. Individual learning can pro-duce innovative behaviors that are novel for an individual or a population, and increasethe behavioral flexibility of the former and the behavioral diversity of the latter (READER& LALAND 2003b). In contrast, social learning involves, by definition, the adoption of abehavior already performed by others (GALEF & LALAND 2005). Thus social learning canlead to increased behavioral flexibility in the individual that adopts new behavioralvariants, but generally does not increase behavioral diversity, where behavioral diver-sity is analogous to species diversity within ecological communities. This is becauseBehavioral flexibility and species invasions 395social learning does not introduce new variants into a population, unless the model forthe behavior is new to the population, and may reduce the frequency of many existingvariants (READER & LALAND 2003b). Furthermore, when social learning is focused ononly a few models or behavioral variants, it can lead to the establishment of learnedcultural traditions that supplant behaviors acquired through innovation, and thus leadto an overall reduction in the number of behavioral variants expressed by individualsand the population (BOYD & RICHERSON 1985; LALAND et al. 1996). Thus social learningmay have contrasting effects on behavioral flexibility and diversity at the individual andpopulation levels depending on which individuals learn and adopt new behaviors, whichindividuals model behaviors that are incorporated by others, and the relative frequency ofthe behavioral variant being learned. These contrasting effects are reflected in historicalviews of social learning and culture, which have been considered by some workers as con-servative forces, and by others as sources of novel behaviors (GALEF 2003).In recent years there has been an increase in the number of empirical studies ofthe causes and consequences of behavioral flexibility. Many studies take a comparativeapproach to examine environmental, neuroanatomical and social correlates of behav-ioral flexibility across species. Comparative studies of primates have found associa-tions between brain size and innovation, social learning and tool use (READER &LALAND 2002); between innovation and sex, age and social rank (READER & LALAND2001); between innovation and neophilia (DAY et al. 2003); and between innovationand neocortex size, diet breadth, and laboratory measures of learning but not withgeographic range or climatic variability (READER & MACDONALD 2003). Comparativestudies of birds have found similar trends, with associations between the size of thehyperstriatum ventrale and feeding innovation (TIMMERMANS et al. 2000); neophiliaand learning (GREENBERG 2003); brain size and mortality rates (SOL et al. 2007); brainsize and climatic variability (SCHUCK-PAIM et al. 2008); brain size and social complexity(BURISH et al. 2004); and between brain size and both propensity to innovate and suc-cess in novel habitats (SOL et al. 2005).A complementary line of investigation conducted largely with captive populationshas focused on inter-individual variation in flexibility and its costs, benefits and conse-quences. In guppies, Poecilia reticulata, innovation ability, as measured by completinga novel foraging task, was found to vary with sex, body size and degree of food depriva-tion (LALAND & READER 1999a), and innovation rate was correlated with competitiveability in males but not females (LALAND & READER 1999b). These results suggest thatinnovation may be state dependent and triggered by metabolic needs. Further studiesdemonstrated that specific behavioral innovations could increase in frequency in popu-lations via social learning (LACHLAN et al. 1998; READER & LALAND 2000). In some casesthis process led to a potentially maladaptive conformity to a specific behavior (LALAND &WILLIAMS 1998; DAY et al. 2003) that was subsequently released in the absence of demo-nstrators (BROWN & LALAND 2002). In starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, individual learningrates were correlated with neophilia, dominance and speed of solving a novel foragingtask (BOOGERT et al. 2006). Surprisingly, social associations in starlings did not predictthe path by which foraging innovations spread through groups, perhaps because ofartificially small and confined groups (BOOGERT et al. 2008). Likewise, in both rooks,Corvus frugilegus, and ravens, Corvus corax, neophobia to novel foods is reduced in thepresence of conspecifics (STOWE et al. 2006a; DALLY et al. 2008); in ravens the degree ofneophobia, and of social learning, is further modified by the social relationships amongindividuals (STOWE et al. 2006b; SCHWAB et al. 2008). Wild Carib grackles, Quiscaluslugubris, were found to vary their expression of a novel foraging behavior with foodtype and risk of kleptoparasitism, suggesting that individuals may vary their behavioral396 T.F. Wright et al.repertoire with social context (MORAND-FERRON et al. 2004). Additional avian examples ofvariation in neophobia and exploratory behavior with age and social context arereviewed in GREENBERG & METTKE-HOFMANN (2001). Overall these studies suggest that (i)behavioral flexibility sometimes confers fitness advantages, (ii) these benefits vary withsocial context, individual state and the external environment, and thus (iii) the expres-sion of flexibility can vary over time in potentially adaptive ways.FLEXIBILITY AND SPECIES INVASIONSWhile an interest in the adaptive nature of behavioral responses to environmentalchange has long been an integral part of the study of animal behavior, there is anincreasing interest in the role played by behavioral flexibility in species invasions (SOL2003; PRICE & SOL 2008). Invasion by exotic species is one of the largest threats to nativespecies worldwide (WILCOVE et al. 1998; SALA et al. 2000; CLAVERO & GARCÍA-BERTHOU2005; but see GUREVITCH & PADILLA 2004). Invasive species can modify habitats, reducespecies diversity through competition and predation, facilitate disease emergence andadversely affect ecosystem functions (MOONEY et al. 2005; PIMENTEL et al. 2005; SALO et al.2007). Successful invasion of a new habitat involves several successive stages (RICHARDSONet al. 2000; KOLAR & LODGE 2001; COLAUTTI & MACISAAC 2004): transport from nativehabitat (generally human-mediated), introduction to new habitat, establishment andgrowth of a self-sustaining population at the original introduction site (also termed “natu-ralization”; RICHARDSON et al. 2000), and invasion to new sites (see Fig. 1 in KOLAR &LODGE 2001). At present there are gaps in our understanding of the invasion process andthe factors that facilitate or inhibit transition between one stage and another (RICHARDSONet al. 2000; KOLAR & LODGE 2001; PUTH & POST 2005). An improved knowledge of thebehavioral characteristics that facilitate species invasions should aid in the control andmitigation of their detrimental effects (KOLAR & LODGE 2001; SOL 2003; CASSEY et al. 2004).Behavioral flexibility is thought to aid introduced species during invasion by pro-viding them with the ability to expand or even change their ecological niche by exploitingnew foods, shelters, or habitats (DUNCAN et al. 2003; PRICE et al. 2008). It may also pro-vide a mechanism for avoiding ecological and evolutionary traps, which may resultfrom rapid environmental changes that alter the reliability of cues used in behavioral orlife-history decisions (SCHLAEPFER et al. 2002). Such plasticity is distinct from consider-ations of species as “generalists” or “specialists”; these classifications are static conceptsbased on physiological constraints and overlook the potentially rapid responses to envi-ronmental changes that can occur through innovation or social learning of novel behav-iors (GREENBERG 1990). The idea that more flexible species are more likely to besuccessful invaders is a longstanding one (MAYR 1965; ROUGHGARDEN 1972; MORSE 1980).Recent comparative studies have supported this hypothesis, with more innovative birdspecies (as measured by feeding innovations) being more successful invaders of New Zea-land (SOL & LEFEBVRE 2000) and worldwide (SOL et al. 2002, 2005); similar patterns areseen in mammals (SOL et al. 2008). The combination of innovation with social learning,as documented in a number of primate species (READER & LALAND 2002), is likely to beespecially advantageous for species in novel habitats, as it could allow copying explora-tory behavior per se as well as permitting the rapid transmission of successful strategies.On the other hand, there may be benefits in limiting the degree of flexibility andexploratory behavior expressed by an individual. For example, neophobia, or the avoid-ance of novel objects, could reduce an organism’s exposure to the deleterious effects ofunfamiliar resources such as novel foods, nesting sites or shelter, and by doing so couldBehavioral flexibility and species invasions 397minimize an organism’s exposure to dangerous predators, diseases or toxic foods,and reduce expenditures on energetically costly activities like antiparasite behaviors(GREENBERG 1990, 2003; GREENBERG & METTKE-HOFMANN 2001; HUGHES & CREMER2007). Greenberg’s “neophobia threshold hypothesis” suggests that neophobia regu-lates an animal’s degree of ecological plasticity, since the response to novelty plays arole in ecologically important behaviors such as food and habitat choice (GREENBERG1990). Neophobia may be modulated by neophilia, or a tendency toward exploratorybehavior; these two behavioral drives were hypothesized by GREENBERG & METTKE-HOFMANN (2001) to vary independently with the degree of environmental complexityand the degree of danger or competition in a given environment to produce differinglevels of exploratory behavior under different ecological conditions. Limited behavio-ral flexibility may also be advantageous when behaviors that are beneficial in a newhabitat are linked with dispersal strategies, at least during natural range expansions(DUCKWORTH & BADYAEV 2007).While much of the work to date regarding invasion success has examined inter-specific patterns of invasion and correlates of success, recent studies of several taxa pro-vide evidence that behavioral flexibility may be an important mechanism involved inthe invasion of new habitats. MARTIN & FITZGERALD (2005) found that under controlledcaptive conditions, individual house sparrows, Passer domesticus, from an activelyinvading population (Colón, Panama) were more likely to approach and consumenovel foods than were sparrows from a long-established population (Princeton, NewJersey). A comparison of introduced versus native populations of the rusty crayfish,Oronectes rusticus, found that foraging behavior varied depending on the competitorspecies present in native vs introduced habitats, and this behavioral flexibility mayexplain the higher growth rates, and invasiveness, of O. rusticus in its introduced range(PINTOR & SIH 2009). Field and laboratory studies of the invasive Argentine ant, Linepi-thema humile, show that colonies are able to modify their aggressive behavior depend-ing on their size and the presence of competitors, and this behavioral flexibility couldallow even small colonies to persist and thrive in a new environment (SAGATA & LESTER2009). Based on these findings, SAGATA & LESTER (2009) point out that propagule size,which is thought to be a fundamental driver of invasions (LOCKWOOD et al. 2005;SIMBERLOFF 2009), may have limited power to predict invasion success in species withbehavioral flexibility. Furthermore, a spatially explicit individual-based model hasshown that learning can facilitate the expansion into a novel habitat by allowing thepersistence of locally (genetically) maladapted populations (SUTTER & KAWECKI 2009).These model-based findings are supported by field and experimental studies of cray-fish (HAZLETT et al. 2002) and crabs (ROUDEZ et al. 2008), which have found signifi-cantly greater learning abilities for invasive species when compared with nativerelatives. Finally, a well-documented example of a behavioral innovation facilitating theinvasion of a new habitat is provided by black rats, Rattus rattus, that have successfullyinvaded the Jerusalem pine forest as a result of a feeding innovation (stripping pinecones to obtain seeds) that is transmitted via social learning (TERKEL 1994, 1995).These studies are evidence of a growing recognition that learning and behavioralflexibility are key factors in the success of invasive species. To our knowledge, however,there have been no longitudinal studies of behavioral flexibility during invasion; itremains to be determined exactly how behavioral flexibility enhances invasion success,whether the benefits of flexibility are constant over all stages of invasion, and to whatdegree the expression of behavioral flexibility might vary adaptively during differentinvasion stages (SOL 2003).398 T.F. Wright et al.THE ADAPTIVE FLEXIBILITY HYPOTHESISWe propose that individuals in invasive populations will change the degree to whichthey express behavioral flexibility during different stages of invasion in an adaptive manner(Fig. 1). Specifically, we hypothesize that during the initial introduction stage, when found-ing individuals are exploring a new environment, innovation will be favored and the expres-sion of flexibility, as measured by the number of behavioral variants present in apopulation, will be high. Populations in which these individuals survive and reproduce suf-ficiently to create a self-sustaining population would enter the establishment stage of spe-cies invasions. Copying more successful behavioral variants will be favored over explorationand innovation in established populations due to the time costs associated with explorationand the opportunity costs of foregoing behavioral alternatives that others have demon-strated to be successful. These processes would lead to a gradual decrease in the number ofbehavioral variants observed. If the founding population continues to grow to a sufficientdegree, it will enter the invasion stage in which overcrowding favors dispersal and thefounding of daughter populations. Where these new populations occupy novel environ-ments that offer new resources to be exploited and new dangers to be avoided, behavioralflexibility will again be favored in dispersers, leading to a transitory rise in the number ofbehavioral variants. Successful daughter populations would in turn enter an establishedstage in which behavioral diversity would be reduced by copying of the most successfulbehavioral variants; this suite of variants may well differ from those persisting in the found-ing population. We term this hypothesis the “adaptive flexibility hypothesis” (Fig. 1a).There are several alternatives to the adaptive flexibility hypothesis (Fig. 1b–d). Onealternative is that the expression of behavioral flexibility is constant regardless of invasionstage. Levels of behavioral flexibility may remain constant through time and uniformacross individuals because a species’ inherent propensity for flexibility is relatively fixed.Alternatively, behavioral flexibility may be fixed at different levels in different individualsor classes of individuals due to consistent personality differences or behavioral syndromes(SIH et al. 2004). Consistent individual differences have been documented for exploratorybehavior in great tits, Parus major, in which individuals can be sorted into fast or slowexplorers by the latency to which they approached a novel object or explored a novel habi-tat (VERBEEK et al. 1994). Such differences have been shown to be both repeatable withinan adult individual and heritable in wild birds (DINGEMANSE et al. 2002), but are less repeat-able within an individual in lines artificially selected for either fast or slow exploratorybehavior (CARERE et al. 2005). A second alternative is, that after an initial rise, the numberof behavioral variants in a population remains relatively constant over time due to a “skillpool effect” (GIRALDEAU 1994) in which individuals remain specialized on a few behavioralvariants rather than copying the successful variants of others. A third alternative is thatcopying of successful variants does occur during the establishment phase, resulting in areduced suite of behavioral variants in a population, but that the cultural traditionsformed through copying are sufficiently strong that dispersing individuals do not exhibitan increased diversity of behaviors upon founding daughter populations. Low diversity ofbehavioral variants may also be expected if dispersers selectively settle in environmentsthat best match their learned behavioral repertoire. All of these alternatives, and the adap-tive flexibility hypothesis itself, are amenable to testing as discussed below.The adaptive flexibility hypothesis is primarily applicable to behaviors with a sig-nificant learned component, and incorporates several behavioral processes related tolearning. These include neophobia, innovation, individual learning and social learning.Evaluating the relative importance of these various processes is critical to testing andrefining the hypothesis. We predict that where novel behaviors are rewarded, individualBehavioral flexibility and species invasions 399Fig. 1. — Conceptual models of different alternatives for changes in the expression of behavioral flexi-bility through successive stages of a species invasion. Behavioral flexibility is measured by the numberof behavioral variants in a population (solid line). Vertical dashed lines denote the various stages of spe-cies invasion listed across the bottom of the figure. The introduction stage represents the initial periodthat follows the movement of a species into a novel habitat via human actions, the establishment stagerepresents the period when this initial introduced population becomes self-sustaining, and the invasionstage represents the period when this population spreads beyond the initial point of introduction andbecomes abundant (RICHARDSON et al. 2000; KOLAR & LODGE 2001).

Wright et al.learning and innovation could quickly lead to the expression of a large variety ofalternative behaviors expressed by different individuals in a recently introduced popu-lation. Subsequently, biased social learning of successful variants is key to the declinein behavioral variants predicted by the hypothesis. Although we have emphasized cop-ying behavior as the most obvious form of social learning that would produce thiseffect, it is likely that other forms of social learning, such as local enhancement, stimu-lus enhancement, or social facilitation, would also reduce the diversity of behaviors. Inthese types of social learning, individuals would be acquiring behavior patterns in thesame context as the model, which would often result in the same behavioral outcome.It will be important to test this prediction that all forms of social learning would havesimilar effects, since copying is generally thought to be less taxonomically widespreadthan other forms of social learning (DUKAS 1998a; SHETTLEWORTH 1998).The adaptive flexibility hypothesis focuses on how individuals and populations mightchange in their expression of behavioral plasticity on relatively short timescales throughlearning. The predicted decline in behavioral flexibility could occur over successive genera-tions or even within a single generation, depending on how frequently individuals learnednew variants and whether transmission of learned variants was vertical (between genera-tions) or horizontal (within generations). It is also possible that selection might lead toadaptive changes over many generations in the genetic mechanisms underlying behavior;such changes might lead to an increased capacity (rather than the propensity) to expressbehavioral flexibility, or they might lead to a reduction of the capacity for social learningthrough genetic accommodation of successful variants (WEST-EBERHARD 2003).Learned behaviors that might be expected to show adaptive flexibility include for-aging strategies, diet choice, nesting or burrowing site choice, roosting or sleeping sitechoice, anti-predator responses, preferred group sizes, mate choice and anti-parasitestrategies. Not all learned behaviors are expected to follow this model; for example,learned vocal signals may be under a different selection regime than many other learnedbehaviors (SLATER & LACHLAN 2003). Where shared vocal patterns are used to denotegroup membership (NOWICKI 1983; BOUGHMAN 1998), convergence to a single vocal vari-ant may occur quickly in newly established populations without any intermediate rise inthe number of variants expressed by individuals. In species where learned vocal signalsare used as honest indicators of individual quality in social competition for resources or ingaining access to mates (WEST-EBERHARD 1983; SEARCY & NOWICKI 2005), selection mayeither favor diversification or homogeneity of vocal signals independent of invasion stage.The adaptive flexibility hypothesis and its alternatives are testable given multiplepopulations of a behaviorally flexible introduced species. The most direct test would beprovided by longitudinal studies that track the changes in the number of variants of a par-ticular class of behavior (e.g. foraging methods) used by known individuals within a singlefounding population and its daughter populations as they pass through different stagesof invasion. An alternative approach would be to catalog behavioral variants of differentcopying of successful variants leads to cultural traditions. The dotted line represents the rise in behavioralvariants predicted in newly established daughter populations due to innovation in a new environment.(b) Alternative hypothesis 1 suggests that the degree of behavioral flexibility expressed by a species (orclasses of individuals within species) is stable, leading to a constant number of variants across stages.(c) Alternative hypothesis 2 is based on the “skill pool effect” (GIRALDEAU 1994), which suggests that indi-viduals would maintain specialized subsets of the behavioral variants present in a population ratherthan copying successful variants, leading to a constant number of behavioral variants in a population afteran initial rise due to innovation. (d) Alternative hypothesis 3 suggests that the cultural traditions formedthrough social copying could be sufficiently strong to suppress innovation in daughter populationsfounded during the invasion stage.Behavioral flexibility and species invasions 401populations to quantify the expression of behavioral flexibility in a particular class ofbehavior. If these populations vary in their invasion stage then the numbers of variants canbe compared across populations as a measure of the degree of behavioral flexibilityexpressed by individuals during different stages of invasion; here behavioral variation atthe population level would serve as a proxy measure of behavioral flexibility at the individ-ual level based on the testable assumption that population diversity was not produced byindividual specialization. A third approach would be to compare introduced populationswith ones from the native range. The latter are likely to represent established populationsto which behavioral variants within invading populations at different stages may be com-pared. A fourth approach would be experiments with captive individuals to assess a spe-cies’ general propensity for innovation, copying, neophobia and flexibility, and to test thecritical assumption that individuals will preferentially copy variants that are more success-ful in a particular environment. Finally, quantitative modeling approaches would be usefulto determine the range of conditions under which the temporal changes in behavioral flex-ibility predicted by the adaptive flexibility hypothesis might occur, and to disentangle therelative importance of the various underlying behavioral processes.CONCLUSIONSThere is considerable evidence from a range of species suggesting that behavioralflexibility can benefit those individuals that employ it. These advantages may vary withsocial context, individual state and external environment, suggesting that the expressionof flexibility might be expected to vary over time even within an individual. There isincreasing evidence that behavioral flexibility plays an important role in facilitatinginvasions by species, particularly in species capable of both individual and social learn-ing. Our proposed adaptive flexibility hypothesis predicts that the expression of behav-ioral flexibility might change with stage of invasion, with high flexibility observed earlyin invasions followed by decreases as some individuals identify locally adaptive behav-ioral strategies and these innovations spread through social learning. Studies focusingon the number of variants expressed in a population and the degree of flexibilityexpressed by individuals should provide more insight into the causes and consequencesof species invasions and the evolution of behavioral flexibility in general.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSWe thank C.

Anthropogenically induced adaptation to invade hypothesis,100027538,Blackwell Publishing LtdThe evolutionary consequences of biological invasions,,"Andrew V. Suarez, Neil D. Tsutsui",2014,"A major challenge of invasion biology is the development of a predictive framework that prevents new invasions. This is inherently difficult because different biological character-istics are important at the different stages of invasion: opportunity/transport, establish-ment and spread. Here, we draw from recent research on a variety of taxa to examine the evolutionary causes and consequences of biological invasions. The process of introduction may favour species with characteristics that promote success in highly disturbed, human-dominated landscapes, thus exerting novel forms of selection on introduced populations. Moreover, evidence is accumulating that multiple introductions can often be critical to the successful establishment and spread of introduced species, as they may be important sources of genetic variation necessary for adaptation in new environments or may permit the introduction of novel traits. Thus, not only should the introduction of new species be prevented, but substantial effort should also be directed to preventing the secondary introduction of previously established species (and even movement of individuals among introduced populations). Modern molecular techniques can take advantage of genetic changes postintroduction to determine the source of introduced populations and their vectors of spread, and to elucidate the mechanisms of success of some invasive species. Moreover, the growing availability of genomic tools will permit the identification of underlying genetic causes of invasive success",,text,"adaptation, behaviour, genetic drift, hybridization, invasive species",,
Anthropogenically induced adaptation to invade hypothesis,484292564,Elucidating the Joint Effects of Biotic and Abiotic Factors on Species Invasion: A Trait-based Approach,,"Simon, Margaret",2017,"Species invasions present a major environmental challenge due to their negative impacts on biodiversity, natural and agricultural ecosystems, and human health. Climate warming increases rates of invasion, but the field lacks a full understanding of the processes generating this pattern.  To mitigate the negative effects of warming-facilitated invasions, we must understand the role that temperature plays in invasion success. A critical component of this agenda is to understand the effects of temperature on the invasion of ectothermic species in particular, as a large proportion of high-impacting pest and pathogen invaders are ectotherms. A successful invasion requires that an invader colonize the thermal environment, as well as establish into the biotic environment, the latter of which exposes the invader to competitive and antagonistic interactions with native residents. Because temperature affects both invader colonization and establishment, ectotherm invasions represent a complex interplay between temperature, invader persistence, and biotic interactions.	Here we develop a conceptual framework for predicting the outcome of such complexity. The framework links the thermal environment to ectotherm population dynamics and interactions through impacts of temperature on life history and interaction traits. We integrate the temperature response of these traits into delay differential equations to make mechanistic predictions regarding the effects of warming on stage-structured populations and community-level dynamics. We use the framework to examine the effect of temperature on exotic invasion success by characterizing the fundamental thermal niche of an invader and the ways in which a resident competitor might constrain the thermal niche. We then ask how climate warming impacts these invasions.	Within the fundamental thermal niche of ectotherms, we find that high temperatures maximize the probability of colonization, but low temperatures maximize invader abundance. We find that ectotherms adapted to low latitudes (tropical climates) are more successful invaders of high latitudes (temperate climates) as compared to the other way around. Further, we find that warming can allow tropical invaders to establish when they could not under ambient temperate climates. Taken together, the dissertation clarifies our understanding of the mechanisms by which exotic species insert themselves into native communities under ambient and warming climates",,etd,Ecology,,"eScholarship, University of California"

Carroll,2007,"Ongoing adaptation in native populations to anthropogenic change both facilitates and challenges ecologically appropriate and sustainable management. Human disturbance promotes adaptive responses at the genomic, individual and population levels. Traits vary widely in whether adaptation occurs through plasticity or evolution, and these modes inter-act within and among traits. For example, plasticity in one trait may be adaptive because it permits homeostasis and lessens the intensity of selection in another. Both opportunity and catastrophe generate adaptive responses. Recently evolved adaptations characterize the responses of many native species to biotic invasions. Several well-known examples involve native phytophagous insects colonizing introduced plants. For example, our studies of North American and Australian soapberry bugs on nonindigenous plants demonstrate both diversifying and homogenizing contemporary evolution. Modes of adaptation differ among traits and populations and as a function of the host on which they develop. The genetic architecture of the evolving adaptations involves a substantial degree of nonadditive genetic variation. One important consequence of contemporary adaptation may be an enhanced capacity of native communities to provide adaptive biological control of invasive species. Conservation scientists may manipulate adaptation to achieve conservation goals, but must also decide how deeply they wish to attempt to control the phenotypes and geno-types of other species",,text,"adaptation, biological control, conservation, contemporary evolution, invasion, soap- berry bug",,

We evaluate evidence for population differentiation, natural selection and adaptive evolution of invading plants and animals at two nested spatial scales: (i) among introduced populations (ii) between native and introduced genotypes. Evolution during invasion is frequently inferred, but rarely confirmed as adaptive. In common garden studies, quantitative trait differentiation is only marginally lower (~3.5%) among introduced relative to native populations, despite genetic bottlenecks and shorter timescales (i.e. millennia vs. decades). However, differentiation between genotypes from the native vs. introduced range is less clear and confounded by nonrandom geographic sampling; simulations suggest this causes a high false-positive discovery rate (>50%) in geographically structured populations. Selection differentials (¦s¦) are stronger in introduced than in native species, although selection gradients (¦β¦) are not, consistent with introduced species experiencing weaker genetic constraints. This could facilitate rapid adaptation, but evidence is limited. For example, rapid phenotypic evolution often manifests as geographical clines, but simulations demonstrate that nonadaptive trait clines can evolve frequently during colonization (~two-thirds of simulations). Additionally, QST-FST studies may often misrepresent the strength and form of natural selection acting during invasion. Instead, classic approaches in evolutionary ecology (e.g. selection analysis, reciprocal transplant, artificial selection) are necessary to determine the frequency of adaptive evolution during invasion and its influence on establishment, spread and impact of invasive species. These studies are rare but crucial for managing biological invasions in the context of global change",,Article,"Adaptation, Contemporary Evolution, Invasive Species, Quantitative Genetics, Ecological Genetics, Natural Selection and Contemporary Evolution",,

The context dependency of impact has fueled the perception that meaningful generalizations are nonexistent. Here, we identified and reviewed 19 testable hypotheses that explain temporal and spatial variation in impact. Despite poor validation of most hypotheses to date, evidence suggests that each can explain at least some impacts in some situations. Several hypotheses are broad in scope (applying to plants and animals in virtually all contexts) and some of them, intriguingly, link processes of colonization and impact. Collectively, these hypotheses highlight the importance of the functional ecology of the nonnative species and the structure, diversity, and evolutionary experience of the recipient community as general determinants of impact; thus, they could provide the foundation for a theoretical framework for understanding and predicting impact.

Many introduced species have a strong negative influence on the new local environment and lead to high economic costs. There is a strong interest to understand why some species are successful in invading new environments and others not. Most of our understanding and generalizations thereof, however, are based on studies of plants and animals, and little is known on invasion processes of microorganisms. We conducted a microcosm experiment to understand factors promoting the success of biological invasions of aquatic microorganisms. In a controlled lab experiment, protist and rotifer species originally isolated in North America invaded into a natural, field-collected community of microorganisms of European origin. To identify the importance of environmental disturbances on invasion success, we either repeatedly disturbed the local patches, or kept them as undisturbed controls. We measured both short-term establishment and long-term invasion success, and correlated it with species-specific life-history traits. We found that environmental disturbances significantly affected invasion success. Depending on the invading species ’ identity, disturbances were either promoting or decreasing invasion success. The interaction between habitat disturbance and species identity was especially pronounced for long-term invasion success. Growth rate was the most important trait promoting invasion success, especially when the species invaded into a disturbed local community. W",,text,,,

Factors enhancing transmission, such as increased aggregation, could be offset by better host immunity due to improved nutrition. Here, we conduct a review and meta-analysis to show that food provisioning results in highly heterogeneous infection outcomes that depend on pathogen type and anthropo-genic food source. We also find empirical support for behavioural and immune mechanisms through which human-provided resources alter host exposure and tolerance to pathogens. A review of recent theoretical models of resource provisioning and infection dynamics shows that changes in host contact rates and immunity produce strong non-linear responses in pathogen inva-sion and prevalence. By integrating results of our meta-analysis back into a theoretical frame-work, we find provisioning amplifies pathogen invasion under increased host aggregation and tolerance, but reduces transmission if provisioned food decreases dietary exposure to parasites.

Habitat alteration, over-exploitation, biological invasions and co-extinctions were identified as an ‘evil quartet’nearly two decades ago (Diamond 1989). Together with climate change, their present andlikely future effects on biodiversity and human well-being remain among the most sig-nificant problems presently facing humanity (Sala et al. 2000; Chown and Gaston 2008).Although much is known about the mechanistic basis of each of these drivers, how they arelikely to interact has not been comprehensively investigated across the full range ofinteractions (Brook et al. 2008). For example, understanding of the nature and outcome ofinteractions among habitat alteration and invasion is growing rapidly, and it is clear that the‘driver-passenger’ relationship is often context dependent (Daehler 2003; Didham et al.2007). Similarly, appreciation of how habitat alteration, patchiness, climate change andshort-term evolutionary responses act in isolation and in concert to affect species distri-butions across the landscape is also growing rapidly (Warren et al. 2001; Carroll and Fox2007; de Mazancourt et al. 2008). By contrast, interactions between climate change andinvasion are poorly understood.It is widely thought that climate change will exacerbate the extent and impact ofbiological invasions, affecting each of the stages in the invasion process (Cannon 1998;Hobbs and Mooney 2005; Theoharides and Dukes 2007), and, where non-indigenousspecies have established, often favouring them over indigenous species (Dukes andMooney 1999). Whilst evidence is accumulating to support some of these conjectures (e.g.,Holzapfel and Vinebrooke 2005; Chown et al. 2007), the number of empirical studies ofinteractions between climate change and invasion remains relatively limited (Walther et al.2009). Indeed, several recent reviews have concluded that the information available isinsufficient for empirical generalization (Ward and Masters 2007; Chown and Gaston2008; Brook 2008). This is especially true for how such interactions might play out at themechanistic level (Agrawal 2001; Stachowicz et al. 2002). Nonetheless, two majorhypotheses have been proposed.First, invasive species have a suite of traits that enhance their performance relative toindigenous ones over a reasonably wide set of circumstances. In consequence, climatechange will continue to mean that these species perform better than their indigenouscounterparts. The foundation of this idea stretches back at least to Elton (1958) and hasformed the basis of a large literature attempting to identify the species-level characteristicsthat might promote invasion. For example, in plants, invasive species are often charac-terized by large stature, high seed mass, rapid and profuse seedling emergence, and self-fertilization (Richardson and Pyšek 2006; van Kleunen and Johnson 2007; van Kleunenet al. 2008, but see also Davis and Shaw 2001; Daehler 2003). In consequence, thesespecies are able to take advantage of a reasonably broad range of conditions, especiallythose that are considered favourable for plant performance generally, such as warm, moist,nutrient rich circumstances (Stohlgren et al. 2008). This idea has also been extended tomany other groups. For example, invasive invertebrate species are apparently often small-bodied and have high-growth rates, so promoting their success in novel environments(Lawton and Brown 1986; Gaston et al. 2001). In birds, behavioural flexibility, broad1366 Evol Ecol (2010) 24:1365–1380123environmental tolerances and wide resource use are all thought to favour invasion (Duncanet al. 2003). Thus, if invasive species have a suite of characteristics that enable them tosucceed under a reasonably wide range of conditions they should perform better underwarmer conditions too. In ectotherms, the generally positive relationship between growthrate and temperature (Chown and Nicolson 2004; Ward and Masters 2007) means that thiswill be especially likely as long as the temperature increase does not exceed organismalthermal safety margins (see also Deutsch et al. 2008; Frazier et al. 2008), and mismatchesin phenology do not limit resource availability (Parmesan 2007). However, this hypothesisprovides no grounds for expecting that climate change will increasingly favour invasivespecies.Second, invasive species have greater phenotypic plasticity than their indigenouscounterparts. In consequence, they will be better able to retain performance under thealtered circumstances precipitated by climate change. This hypothesis is a component ofthe idea first proposed by Baker (1965) of a ‘‘general purpose genotype’’, and has garneredsome support both for plants (Daehler 2003; Richardson and Pyšek 2006) and animals(Trussell and Smith 2000; Rosecchi et al. 2001; Duncan et al. 2003; Dzialowski et al. 2003,but see also Lee et al. 2007). In the context of climate change, Stachowicz et al. (2002)demonstrated that invasive ascidians had steeper growth rate–temperature relationshipsthan an indigenous species, and argued that this has favoured the introduced species underwarming, an idea supported by several years of demographic data. By contrast, Chownet al. (2007) found no difference in the extent of phenotypic plasticity for desiccationtolerance in indigenous and invasive springtails. However, they showed that the form ofplasticity differed between these two groups. Invasive species are favoured followingexposure to warm conditions, whilst indigenous species perform better following a lowtemperature treatment.Clearly, plasticity may evolve independently of or in concert with the trait mean, andindeed how this interaction should be viewed and modelled has been the subject of muchdiscussion (see Scheiner 1993; de Jong 1995, 2005; Via et al. 1995; Ghalambor et al.2007). Nonetheless, as a matter of convenience the mean and plasticity can be consideredrelatively independent (see Ghalambor et al. 2007: 396). Thus, the mechanistic, organis-mal-level exploration of interactions between climate change and invasion can beapproached from complementary perspectives: the way that differences in mean traitvalues among indigenous and invasive species are likely to affect performance or survivalunder a new set of conditions, and the way that variation in reaction norms among thesetwo groups of species may affect fitness under altered conditions (Lee 2002; Lee et al.2003; Dybdahl and Kane 2005). This does not mean that mean trait values and plasticityare necessarily independent (see de Jong 1995, 2005; van Kleunen and Fischer 2005;Ghalambor et al. 2007), but does provide a framework within which the historical per-spectives of differences in trait values and in plasticity among indigenous and invasivespecies can be interpreted.Here, we adopt this approach to investigate the likely impacts of interactions betweenclimate change and invasion, mediated through egg development rate and its response totemperature, in a springtail assemblage from a cool, temperate ecosystem that is under-going significant climate change (Chown et al. 2007; see Dybdahl and Kane 2005 for asimilar approach). Springtails were chosen as the study organisms because they are aglobally significant group of soil invertebrates that play major roles in ecosystem func-tioning (Rusek 1998), including in the system we investigate (Gabriel et al. 2001; Hugoet al. 2004). Egg development rate (or time, given that rate = 1/development time) wasselected because it is an important component of fitness in springtails (as is developmentEvol Ecol (2010) 24:1365–1380 1367123rate more generally—Sibly and Calow 1986; Roff 2002), and the egg development periodencompasses a substantial portion of the life cycle of an individual springtail (van Straalen1994; Birkemoe and Leinaas 2000).Specifically, we first test the hypothesis that over the linear portion of the rate–temperature curve (this portion of the rate–temperature curves is most often the subject ofinvestigation—see e.g., Trudgill et al. 2005; de Jong and van der Have 2008), mean eggdevelopment should be faster in the invasive than in the indigenous species. Next weevaluate the prediction of the reaction norm hypothesis that the invasive species shouldhave steeper rate–temperature relationships than the indigenous species (which has its basisnot only in the findings of Stachowicz et al. (2002) for ascidians, but also in terms of thesame hypothesis proposed for insects from the same region (Chown et al. 2002)). Theoutcomes of these two tests are subsequently explored in the context of what is knownabout the population responses of these species to current climates and climate change, tofurther knowledge of the likely effects of rapid climate change on this system (see le Rouxand McGeoch 2008).MethodsStudy site and speciesAll species used in this study were collected from sub-Antarctic Marion Island (46540S37540E), which has a cool, wet, windy climate that has shown a substantial change overthe last 50 years, including more than a 1.3C increase in mean annual temperature(Chown and Froneman 2008). Sixteen springtail species occur on the island, of which sixare invasive, four endemic and six have a broader, sub-Antarctic distribution (Gabriel et al.2001; Frenot et al. 2005). The invasive springtails are mostly of European origin (Chownet al. 2002) and are thought to have been introduced by humans with animal fodderprovided for sheep that were kept on the island in the 1950s (Cooper and Condy 1988).Thus they have been on the island for at least 40 years (Deharveng 1981). In Europe,original records of the species are mostly from Scandinavia and northern areas of Germany(Fjellberg 1998; Potapov 2001). Low mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) haplotypenumbers (typically a single haplotype) in the invasive springtail species are indicative ofcolonization by a few individuals, whilst the indigenous species are characterized byconsiderable haplotype diversity (Myburgh et al. 2007).For this study, the seven most common Poduromorpha and Entomobryomorpha specieson the island were investigated. Cryptopygus dubius Deharveng (Isotomidae), C. tricuspisEnderlein and C. antarcticus travei Deharveng are indigenous, whilst Ceratophyselladenticulata Bagnall (Hypogastruridae), Parisotoma notabilis Schäeffer (Isotomidae),Isotomurus cf. palustris Müller (Isotomidae) and Pogonognathellus flavescens Tullberg(Tomoceridae) are invasive (Gabriel et al. 2001). The species also differ in depth distri-bution within the soil profile: Isotomurus cf. palustris, C. antarcticus travei and Pogon-ognathellus flavescens are epedaphic or soil-surface dwellers, Cryptopygus dubius andCeratophysella denticulata hemi-edaphic or litter dwellers, and C. tricuspis and Pariso-toma notabilis euedaphic or soil dwellers (see van Straalen 1994 and Hopkin 1997 fordiscussion of depth distributions in springtails).Several hundred adult specimens of each species were collected in the field (below100 m above sea level) using an aspirator and placed into 30 ml vials with moist Plaster-of-Paris substrates and small amounts of detritus for shelter and food, and transported back1368 Evol Ecol (2010) 24:1365–1380123to the laboratory within 5 h of collection. In the laboratory, specimens were kept in 40 mlcontainers, with moist Plaster-of-Paris substrates and small amounts of detritus and algaeas food, in incubators (LABCON, Johannesburg, South Africa, accurate to ±1C) at 5Cwith a 12L: 12D photoperiod. The animals were then transferred to Oslo, Norway, wheremost work was undertaken except for a few additional trials with Cryptopygus antarcticustravei and Isotomurus cf. palustris, which were done in Stellenbosch South Africa. In bothplaces animals were maintained under identical conditions in the same make of incubators(Sanyo MIR 153, Osaka, Japan, accurate to ±0.5C). All individuals used for experimentswere acclimated at 15C (or 10C in the case of Cryptopygus antarcticus travei) for at least14 days before the start of the experiment, as egg production was low at 5C. Distilledwater was added once a week to maintain high humidity and springtails were provided withexcess algae as a food source (replaced once to twice a week to prevent growth of mould).Embryonic development ratesPrevious studies have demonstrated low survival when springtail individuals are keptseparately (e.g., Birkemoe and Leinaas 2000). Thus, 10–20 adults from the stock cultureswere randomly placed in culture boxes (diameter = 3.4 cm, depth = 3 cm) lined withPlaster-of-Paris mixed with charcoal powder (ratio of 9:1). For optimum egg production,and to reduce maternal effects, culture boxes were kept at 15C for one generation, or, forCryptopygus antarcticus travei only, at 10C because mortality in this species was high at15C. Egg batches (Cfive eggs) were then collected daily from culture boxes of eachspecies (except P. flavescens which laid single eggs) and assigned to a particular tem-perature treatment (see below). For each species and each treatment, eggs were distributedat random among at least four culture vials to avoid container effects. The vials were thenplaced into the incubators (Sanyo MIR) at a set temperature and 12L:12D light regime.Eggs were inspected daily until hatching, and at this time containers were randomizedamong shelves to avoid shelf effects. Egg development times (determined as the number ofdays between egg laying and hatching (Birkemoe and Leinaas 2000)) were obtained atc. 5C intervals from 5 to 28.8C to provide complete performance curves (see Angilletta2006; Deere and Chown 2006). Due to technical difficulties (incubator failure) no eggdevelopment time measurements were obtained for P. flavescens above 25C. Cryptopygusantarcticus travei eggs failed to hatch at 20C and above.Hatching success is often traded off against egg development rate (Stearns 1992;Stillwell and Fox 2005; Geister et al. 2009). This means that for a given species, a high eggdevelopment rate may not necessarily also mean high survival under those conditions,resulting in low fitness at high temperatures. Therefore, we also examined hatching successat 15C and at 25C for all species except C. antarcticus travei which had zero hatchingsuccess at 20 and 25C. Specifically, we determined whether hatching success declined inthe indigenous vs. invasive species (irrespective of soil depth category) at the highertemperatures. Hatching success was recorded as the number of eggs that hatched from thetotal number of eggs in the batch. This value was converted to a percentage value (numberof hatched eggs/total number eggs in batch 9 100).AnalysesFirst, whilst recognizing that rate–temperature relationships typically have a non-linearform (Stearns 1992; Angilletta 2006), and that a variety of analytical approaches areavailable to deal with this non-linearity (e.g. David et al. 1997; Izem and Kingsolver 2005)Evol Ecol (2010) 24:1365–1380 1369123only the linear portion of the reaction norm (5–20C in this case, hereafter rate–temper-ature or R–T curve) was analyzed. Such analyses are typical of investigations of rate–temperature relationships (see Trudgill et al. 2005; Ikemoto 2005; de Jong and van derHave 2008). Moreover, the aim here was to consider the sensitivity to development overthe linear part of the temperature range as the reaction norm, and the mean across thesetemperatures as the mean trait value.For the analysis of mean trait values and their reaction norms over the linear portion ofthe R–T curve, general linear models, implemented in Statistica v.8 (Statsoft, Tulsa, OK,USA), were used. In all cases, mean egg development rate per egg batch was used as theindependent data because individual eggs within batches are unlikely to represent inde-pendent data (with the exception of Pogonognathellus flavescens which laid eggs singly).The first hypothesis tested was that mean log10 egg development rate, holding temperatureconstant, differs among the invasive and indigenous species and among the soil depthcategories. Thus, the model included temperature as a covariate to estimate the least-squares mean trait value. However, because the rate–temperature relationship might differamong species, a general linear model specifically testing for whether interactions arepresent between temperature and status (indigenous vs. invasive), and between temperatureand depth category was initially implemented (see Quinn and Keough 2002: 349, the testwas implemented in Statistica v. 8). No slope heterogeneity was found, and in effect thisformed the test of whether the linear reaction norms differed among the species.Because each status by depth group was typically only represented by a single species(except for the ‘epedaphic invasive’ group which included Isotomurus cf. palustris andPogonognathellus flavescens), the power of the above tests to assess the extent to whichany differences among the status and depth groups might be considered general, could bethought of as limited. Therefore, further to examine the extent to which these differencesmight be biologically significant we also undertook a randomization analysis wheredevelopment rate data were randomized among the same number of status and depthgroups. Here we used a resample-without-replacement protocol for both status and depthcategorical variables (see Parr et al. 2005). Then, we calculated mean log10 egg devel-opment rate for 100 random re-samples (run in Microsoft Excel) and computed their 95%confidence limits. This allowed us to undertake a comparison of randomized depth/inva-sive status samples relative to observed egg development rate for each category. Wereasoned that if particular status and depth group means were different to a randomselection of the data, additional confidence could be placed in their biological significance.Because phylogenetic relatedness may have played a major role in influencing thepatterns in trait variation found among these species (given that the data set for theindigenous species included only the genus Cryptopygus) we undertook a second set ofanalyses using phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS). The PGLS and generalizedestimating equation (GEE) analyses were implemented in the APE module (Paradis et al.2004) of the R language open-source software package (following methods outlined inHalsey et al. 2006). The species level phylogeny was constructed using mitochondrial COIsequence data (Supplementary material S3). The tree concurred with previously publishedanalyses (Stevens et al. 2006), with the exception of Cryptopygus tricuspis clustering withCeratophysella denticulata and Pogonognathellus flavescens, as opposed to with otherCryptopygus species (C. antarcticus travei and C. dubius). No reason exists to suppose thatCryptopygus is paraphyletic (based on limited 28S data and on Stevens et al. 2006). Ratherthe outcome was likely due to hemiplasy (Avise and Robinson 2008). Therefore, todetermine branch lengths, the evolutionary tree was constrained to group C. tricuspiswithin the other Cryptopygus species. Branch lengths were determined in PAUP*1370 Evol Ecol (2010) 24:1365–1380123(Swofford 2001) using maximum likelihood analyses and plotted on the tree. Thereafter,PGLS, using these estimated branch lengths in units of mutational change, was used toassess the strength of the effect of the hypothetical phylogeny on the dependent variable byestimating lambda (k). k is an estimate of the phylogenetic covariance in the data and liesbetween 0 and 1; k = 1 indicates a strong influence of phylogeny while k = 0 indicateslittle influence of phylogeny (see Halsey et al. 2006). In the GEE models significancelevels were calculated from phylogenetically adjusted degrees of freedom. The PGLS andGEE analyses were used to investigate variation among the least squares means obtainedfrom the General Linear Model.For analyses of hatching success variation among the indigenous and invasive species atthe higher temperatures (15 and 25C), a generalised linear model analysis, assuming abinomial distribution and a logit link function, was undertaken in SAS (V 9.1) to assesseffects of temperature variation, status (indigenous vs. invasive species) and interactionsbetween temperature and species.Owing to the substantial emphasis that has been placed recently on identifying how thetemperature optimum (Topt), rate at the temperature optimum (umax) from performancecurves might differ among species, environments and treatments (e.g., Gilchrist 1996;Kingsolver and Huey 1998; Angilletta et al. 2002, 2003; Deere and Chown 2006; Deutschet al. 2008) these traits were estimated for each species. This was done using a modificationof the method proposed by Angilletta (2006). For each species, the mean rate per batch ateach temperature was calculated and a curve was fitted to these data using TableCurve 2D(SYSTAT Inc, 2002, San Jose, California, USA). The curve with the largest coefficient ofdetermination was selected, irrespective of the number of terms, because the aim was tofind the best-fitting curve so that Topt and umax could be determined from the fitted curve (inthe latter case using Gilchrist’s (1996) approach with 0.1C temperature increments).Typically, the best fits were provided by the Exponentially Modified Gaussian, and HalfGaussian Modified Gaussian curves (Supplementary material S1). In the case of Crypto-pygus antarcticus travei, individual level data were used because mean data were availableonly at four temperatures so precluding use of the peaked curve equations of TableCurve2D. In this case a LogNormal4 curve provided the best fit (Supplementary material S1).Values for Topt and umax were compared among the indigenous and invasive groups usinga single classification ANOVA.ResultsTemperature had the expected effect on development rate (Fig. 1; Table 1), with maximumdevelopment temperatures found at 27.5C in the invasive species Isotomurus cf. palustris,Ceratophysella denticulata and Parisotoma notabilis, and typically at lower temperaturesfor the indigenous ones (see Appendix S2 for mean data values). In the generalized linearmodel analyses, the homogeneity of slopes model revealed that depth and status had asignificant effect on the mean egg development rate, but no slope heterogeneity wasidentified among the groups (Table 2). Means and confidence intervals for each of thegroups indicated that invasive species typically had faster mean egg development ratesthan the indigenous species except in the hemi-edaphic depth group (Fig. 2). Because theslopes of the rate–temperature relationships did not differ significantly among the groups(including no 3-way interaction), it is clear that the reaction norms, or form and extent ofplasticity, do not differ among them.Evol Ecol (2010) 24:1365–1380 1371123Calculation of lambda suggested limited influence of phylogeny on the least-squares(LS)-adjusted mean development rate (k = 0) (Appendix S3, S4). Thus, phylogenetic-adjusted results were excluded from further interpretation.Mean egg development rates for the invasive species were significantly and substan-tially faster than those obtained by randomization of the data (Fig. 3), suggesting that thesespecies have faster rates than expected on average. By contrast, no differences were foundfor the indigenous groups except for the epedaphic group, which showed much slowerdevelopment rates than those obtained from a random selection of the data.Fig. 1 Reaction norms for egg development rates for seven species of Collembola from Marion Island(mean ± 95% CI at each temperature).

Likewise, umax did not differ significantly among these groups(F(1,5) = 4.45, P = 0.09) (Table 3). However, hatching success was significantly lower at25C in the two indigenous species by comparison with the invasive species (Table 4;Fig. 4a, Appendix S5). These differences remained significant irrespective of whether thespecies were considered separately or grouped by invasive status (Table 4; Fig. 4b).DiscussionInvasive alien species are thought to differ from their indigenous counterparts by virtue ofdifferences in trait means and/or the extent of their phenotypic plasticity. The former ideahas proven controversial with some studies demonstrating significant and sometimesTable 2 Outcome of the generallinear model investigating theinteraction between status, depthdistribution and temperatureEffect Sums of squares df F PStatus 0.0379 1 8.13 0.004898Depth 0.08881 2 9.52 0.000120Temperature 5.40866 1 1159.54 0.000001Status 9 depth 0.08056 2 8.64 0.000267Status 9 temperature 0.0035 1 0.75 0.387570Depth 9 temperature 0.01144 2 1.23 0.295990Status 9 depth 9temperature0.00952 2 1.02 0.362622Error 0.80229 172 Indigenous InvasiveFig. 2 The effect of depth distribution, and whether the species are invasive or indigenous, on mean (±95%CI) egg development rate, when temperature is taken into account using a General Linear Model (seeTable 2)Evol Ecol (2010) 24:1365–1380 1373123substantial differences among these two groups of species in trait means and otherinvestigations finding no differences at all (see Daehler 2003; Duncan et al. 2003;Richardson and Pyšek 2006; Ward and Masters 2007; Walther et al. 2009 for recent-1.7-1.6-1.5-1.4-1.3-1.2Eue Hemi Epe Eue Hemi EpeInd Ind Ind Inv Inv InvGroupMean egg development rate (log10)RandomObservedFig. 3 Summary statistics (means ± 95% CLs) for estimated (observed) egg development rates for eachdepth by status category relative to data randomised for depth and status across all species and categories.Status (ind indigenous or inv invasive) and soil depth category (euedaphic, hemi-edaphic or epedaphic) wererandomised without replacement 100 timesTable 3 Values for the optimumtemperature (Topt) and eggdevelopment rate at Topt (umax)for each speciesSpecies marked with anasterisk are indigenousto the sub-AntarcticSpecies Topt UmaxParisotoma notabilis 27.0 0.151Ceratophysella denticulata 27.8 0.169Pogonognathellus flavescens 24.6 0.134Isotomurus cf. palustris 27.3 0.192Cryptopygus dubius* 24.8 0.119C. tricuspis* 23.9 0.139C. antarcticus travei* 13.8 0.037Table 4 The results from ageneralised linear model assum-ing a binomial distribution and alogit link function, showing theeffects of temperature (Temp) onthe hatching success between(a) species and (b) status(indigenous or invasive)Effect df v2 P(a)Species 5 681.55 \0.0001Temp 1 58.97 \0.0001Species 9 temp 4 17.54 0.0015(b)Status 1 0.01 0.9143Temp 2 28.45 \0.0001Status 9 temp 1 19.44 \0.00011374 Evol Ecol (2010) 24:1365–1380123reviews). In this case, substantial differences in trait means across the linear part of therate–temperature curve (while taking temperature into account) were found among theindigenous and invasive species, with the invasive species having, on average, faster eggdevelopment rates between 5 and 20C than the indigenous species. For umax, the indig-enous species mean (0.0985 or 10 days for development at Topt) was only 61% of thatfound for the invasive species (0.162 or 6 days for development at Topt), but because of therelatively large variance around the means, and the small numbers of species involved, thedifference was not significant. Likewise, Topt did not differ among the two groups.

Importantly, however,hatching success was lower in the indigenous species at 25C (zero in C. antarcticus above20C) than in the invasive species, although such differences were not apparent at 15C.Thus, the invasive species appear to be at an advantage in terms of egg development rateand hatching success at high temperature compared with the indigenous species in mostgroups, except perhaps for the hemi-edaphic species where the difference was notsignificant.Given the fact that each status x depth category was typically only represented by asingle species (a consequence of the nature of the springtail assemblages at the site weinvestigated—see Gabriel et al. 2001), it might be argued that the differences among thegroups are simply an artefact of the species investigated. The randomization proceduresuggested that, perhaps with the exception of the slow developing C. antarcticus, theindigenous species are no different to what might be expected for a random assortment ofegg development rates. However, the invasive species always had faster rates than mightbe expected from a random re-allocation of the data. Thus, further support is provided forthe idea that the invasive species typically have faster development rates than the indig-enous ones. The limited influence of phylogeny (k = 0) also showed that the result is notconfounded by a strong phylogenetic signal in the data. In consequence, at least for thisassemblage of springtails, it does appear that the invasive species typically have muchfaster development rates than the indigenous ones, and a lower susceptibility to hatchingfailure at higher temperatures.This outcome of a significant difference in trait means is in keeping with what has beenfound for adult lower and upper lethal temperatures for a similar group of species fromMarion Island (including many of those studied here), where the indigenous species tendedto have lower freezing points (=lower lethal temperature in this case) and lower, hightemperature tolerances than the invasive species (Slabber et al. 2007). By contrast, durationof survival of dry conditions (75% RH) did not differ among the indigenous and invasivespecies for the adults, although acclimation to high temperature certainly increased sur-vival time in the invasive species, whilst often having the converse effect on the indigenousones (Chown et al. 2007). In consequence, it appears that conclusions about wholeorganismal responses cannot simply be generalized. Rather, the responses likely vary fromtrait to trait, and in concert will determine the performance outcome for the organismconcerned (see also van Kleunen and Johnson 2007). Nonetheless, overall it appears thatwarmer and drier conditions will certainly benefit invasive springtail species on MarionIsland relative to their indigenous counterparts.Across the 5–20C part of the reaction norm, the slopes of the R–T relationships did notdiffer among the species. This outcome is in keeping with that found for other traits in thesame species, notably survival time under desiccating conditions and lower and uppercritical thermal limits (Chown et al. 2007; Slabber et al. 2007), and with other investigationswhere no differences in plasticity have been found (see Daehler 2003; Lee et al. 2007).However, it differs from a range of studies where significant and often substantial differ-ences in phenotypic plasticity among indigenous and invasive species within the same taxahave been found (e.g., Trussell and Smith 2000; Rosecchi et al. 2001; Stachowicz et al.2002; Duncan et al. 2003; Dzialowski et al. 2003; Richardson and Pyšek 2006).From a climate change perspective the present data, in the context of what is knownabout means and reaction norms of other traits in these species (Chown et al. 2007; Slabberet al. 2007), suggest that the invasive species should be predominant in low elevation warmareas of Marion Island, and should continue to be favoured by ongoing warming anddrying. This is indeed what has been found to date. Ecological surveys of the island have1376 Evol Ecol (2010) 24:1365–1380123found exceptionally high densities and dominance of the invasive species at low elevationsacross the island, but an absence of these species at higher, cold, dry elevations (Gabrielet al. 2001). Moreover, field experiments that have simulated predicted warming anddrying on the island (see le Roux and McGeoch 2008) resulted in substantial declines in theabundances of the indigenous species and little change in the abundance of an invasivespecies (Chown et al. 2007). The outcomes of this study also support previous predictions,made on the grounds of qualitative comparisons of insect life history data, that invasivespecies will be favoured by climate change at the island given their short developmenttimes (Chown et al. 2002). However, they contradict the idea that steeper rate–temperaturerelationships in invasive than in indigenous species will further benefit the former underwarmer conditions (Chown et al. 2002). Nonetheless, further evidence that climate changeis benefiting the invasive springtails would be provided by demonstrations of an altitudinalrange expansion. This work is presently underway.In conclusion, the present study has demonstrated that mean egg development rate andhatching success at high temperature, but not the thermal reaction norms of developmentrate, differ consistently between indigenous and invasive springtails on Marion Island, andthat these differences are likely to have substantial implications for assemblage structure asthe climate continues to change (see also Janion et al. 2009). In so doing it demonstrateshow, by considering mean and plasticity of traits separately (see Ghalambor et al. 2007),insight into the mechanistic basis of interactions among climate change and invasion maybe obtained. It also provides further evidence that the interactions among climate changeand invasion are likely to be synergistic (see also Stachowicz et al. 2002) and that suchinteractions need urgent further investigation (Brook 2008). Whether our results forspringtails can be generalized more broadly to this group remains to be determined throughfurther study of assemblages of indigenous and invasive species elsewhere. Nonetheless, itsupports a growing body of work showing that the traits of indigenous and invasive speciesdiffer considerably, probably owing to the characteristics that ensure survival and estab-lishment in the first place (Blackburn et al. 2009).Acknowledgments We thank Erika Nortje, Heidi Sjursen Konestabo and various members of the MarionIsland relief teams for assistance in the field.

Anthropogenically induced adaptation to invade hypothesis,163114776,The effect of environmental fluctuations – Could climate change promote species’ invasion success?,10.17011/conference/eccb2018/108130,"Räsänen, Emmi, Ketola, Tarmo, Lindström, Leena",2018,"The global climate change is presumed to increase the amount of fluctuations in the environmental conditions. This could increase the amount of species invasion into new areas if fluctuations affect the ecological and evolutionary processes that make species successful as invaders, and native communities and their environments more susceptible to invasions1. Disturbed environments are assumed to be more prone to invasions and the fluctuations in invasive species’ home range could pre-adapt them to tolerate similar conditions elsewhere. Under fluctuating conditions, natural selection could potentially favor traits like generalism, which is profitable in adaptation to wide range of conditions2. These attributes could lead to better competitive ability of the invader against the native species, especially if the native species are mal-adapted to tolerate fluctuating conditions. Moreover, the distant relatedness between the invasive species and its native competitors is hypothesized to reduce their competition for the same resources and so increase the success of the invader3. We tested these theories of how fast environmental fluctuations and relatedness of species could affect the invasion success, with our aim to find effects that would be generalizable over the species. In this study, the invasion success meant the ability of the invader population to competitively displace the population of its competitor species. Bacterial species that had evolved in stable or fluctuating temperature were competed against the dominant bacterial invader Serratia marcescens, which had also evolved in stable or fluctuating temperature and the invasions were initiated in environments with similarly stable or fluctuating temperature. In addition, the competitor species were differently related to the invader. The results indicated strong species-specific effects on invasion success, which could be due to the more intense competition detected between closely related species. For most of the species, the rapid temperature fluctuations during invasion made invasions more successful. Unexpectedly, the evolution in the fluctuating environment did not significantly enhance the success of S. marcescens. Instead, our study showed that under fast fluctuations, natural selection could select for generalist genotypes, which invade better also in suboptimal environments. We found the superiority of S. marcescens also when its competitor species had mal-adapted to tolerate thermal fluctuations, but this result was strongly affected by one species. Overall, our results indicate that in the future, the traits of the invader, the attributes of its native competitors and the environmental conditions during invasion need to be considered together when predicting the success of the invasive species under fluctuating conditions.  1.

Anthropogenically induced adaptation to invade hypothesis,544052944,"Ruderals naturalize, competitors invade : Varying roles of plant adaptive strategies along the invasion continuum",10.1111/1365-2435.14145,"Guo, Kun, Pyšek, Petr, Chytrý, Milan, Divíšek, Jan, Lososová, Zdeňka, van Kleunen, Mark, Pierce, Simon, Guo, Wen‐Yong",2022,"1. It is increasingly recognized that the factors facilitating plant invasions depend on the stage along the introduction–naturalization–invasion continuum. Adaptative strategies, that is, combinations of functional traits that represent overall fitness in the face of one or more selection pressures, have shown promise in explaining plant invasions. However, whether adaptive strategy patterns change with stages of plant invasion is not yet known.2. Using the Pladias Database of the Czech Flora and Vegetation, we explored how Grime's adaptive strategies (competitors, stress-tolerators, ruderals; CSR) and introduction pathways (deliberate vs. accidental) relate to plant invasion along the introduction–naturalization–invasion continuum.3. Phylogenetically corrected ANOVAs showed that naturalized species (referring to non-invasive naturalized species in this study) were mostly R-selected, whereas invasive species tended to be C-selected. The results of phylogenetic regression analysis further confirmed that across the deliberately and accidentally introduced species, R- and C-selection were positively related to naturalization and invasion success respectively. We also found that deliberate introduction was negatively related to naturalization success and grid-cell occupancy of naturalized species, likely due to the different CSR strategies of deliberately and accidentally introduced aliens.4. Our study provides empirical evidence that different adaptive strategies are associated with species that have reached different invasion stages and confirms the usefulness of the CSR strategy framework for understanding plant invasion. This has implications for predicting and preventing potential high-impact invaders. For example, our results show that naturalized C-selected species have a higher probability of becoming invasive than naturalized R-selected species. Therefore, management actions are essential to prevent further introductions and spread of competitors.publishe",,info:eu-repo/semantics/article,"alien species, Grime's adaptive strategy, introduction pathways, introduction–naturalization– invasion continuum, invasion stages, info:eu-repo/classification/ddc/570",,'Wiley'
Anthropogenically induced adaptation to invade hypothesis,579927886,MAcroecological Framework for Invasive Aliens (MAFIA): disentangling large-scale context dependence in biological invasions,10.3897/neobiota.62.52787,"Pyšek,Petr, Bacher,Sven, Kühn,Ingolf, Novoa,Ana, Catford,Jane, Hulme,Philip, Pergl,Jan, Richardson,David, Wilson,John Ross, Blackburn,Tim",2020,"Macroecology is the study of patterns, and the processes that determine those patterns, in the distribution and abundance of organisms at large scales, whether they be spatial (from hundreds of kilometres to global), temporal (from decades to centuries), and organismal (numbers of species or higher taxa). In the context of invasion ecology, macroecological studies include, for example, analyses of the richness, diversity, distribution, and abundance of alien species in regional floras and faunas, spatio-temporal dynamics of alien species across regions, and cross-taxonomic analyses of species traits among comparable native and alien species pools. However, macroecological studies aiming to explain and predict plant and animal naturalisations and invasions, and the resulting impacts, have, to date, rarely considered the joint effects of species traits, environment, and socioeconomic characteristics. To address this, we present the MAcroecological Framework for Invasive Aliens (MAFIA). The MAFIA explains the invasion phenomenon using three interacting classes of factors – alien species traits, location characteristics, and factors related to introduction events – and explicitly maps these interactions onto the invasion sequence from transport to naturalisation to invasion. The framework therefore helps both to identify how anthropogenic effects interact with species traits and environmental characteristics to determine observed patterns in alien distribution, abundance, and richness; and to clarify why neglecting anthropogenic effects can generate spurious conclusions. Event-related factors include propagule pressure, colonisation pressure, and residence time that are important for mediating the outcome of invasion processes. However, because of context dependence, they can bias analyses, for example those that seek to elucidate the role of alien species traits. In the same vein, failure to recognise and explicitly incorporate interactions among the main factors impedes our understanding of which macroecological invasion patterns are shaped by the environment, and of the importance of interactions between the species and their environment. The MAFIA is based largely on insights from studies of plants and birds, but we believe it can be applied to all taxa, and hope that it will stimulate comparative research on other groups and environments. By making the biases in macroecological analyses of biological invasions explicit, the MAFIA offers an opportunity to guide assessments of the context dependence of invasions at broad geographical scales",,Research Article,"climate, colonisation pressure, geographic range, habitats, invasion stages, non-native, propagule pressure, residence time, species traits, vertebrates",,Pensoft Publishers
Anthropogenically induced adaptation to invade hypothesis,84829589,Thermotolerance adaptation to human-modified habitats occurs in the native range of the invasive ant Wasmannia auropunctata before long-distance dispersal,10.1111/eva.12058,"Foucaud, Julien, Rey, Olivier, Robert, Stéphanie, Crespin, Laurent, Orivel, Jérôme, Facon, Benoît, Loiseau, Anne, Jourdan, Hervé, Kenne, Martin, Mbenoun Masse, Paul Serge, Tindo, Maurice, Vonshak, Merav, Estoup, Arnaud",2013,"Key evolutionary events associated with invasion success are traditionally thought to occur in the introduced, rather than the native range of species. In the invasive ant Wasmannia auropunctata, however, a shift in reproductive system has been demonstrated within the native range, from the sexual non-dominant populations of natural habitats to the clonal dominant populations of human-modified habitats. Because abiotic conditions of human- modified habitats are hotter and dryer, we performed lab experiments on workers from a set of native and introduced populations, to investigate whether these ecological and genetic transitions were accompanied by a change in thermotolerance and whether such changes occurred before establishment in the introduced range. Thermotolerance levels were higher in native populations from human-modified habitats than in native populations from natural habitats, but were similar in native and introduced populations from human-modified habitats. Differences in thermotolerance could not be accounted for by differences in body size.

In the invasiveant Wasmannia auropunctata, however, a shift in reproductive system has beendemonstrated within the native range, from the sexual non-dominant popula-tions of natural habitats to the clonal dominant populations of human-modifiedhabitats. Because abiotic conditions of human- modified habitats are hotter anddryer, we performed lab experiments on workers from a set of native and intro-duced populations, to investigate whether these ecological and genetic transitionswere accompanied by a change in thermotolerance and whether such changesoccurred before establishment in the introduced range. Thermotolerance levelswere higher in native populations from human-modified habitats than in nativepopulations from natural habitats, but were similar in native and introducedpopulations from human-modified habitats. Differences in thermotolerancecould not be accounted for by differences in body size. A scenario based on localadaptation in the native range before introduction in remote areas represents themost parsimonious hypothesis to account for the observed phenotypic pattern.These findings highlight the importance of human land use in explaining majorcontemporary evolutionary changes.IntroductionMost recent studies trying to decipher the reasons for thesuccess of invasive species have explicitly focused on theintroduced range of invasive species (Richardson et al.2000; Sakai et al. 2001; Colautti and MacIsaac 2004). Thisis logical given that post-introduction ecological and evolu-tionary challenges are likely to be more important thanthose occurring before long-distance dispersal. After theirintroduction into a new area, founding individuals gener-ally have to cope with new demographic and/or environ-mental conditions when compared to their native habitats.New demographic conditions, such as Allee effects orgenetic drift in small populations, can hamper successfulestablishment (Sakai et al. 2001). New biotic and abioticconditions can also constitute severe barriers to successfulinvasions (Blackburn et al. 2011).

The role of pre-adaptation (or prior adaptations, see Hufbauer et al.2012) of certain native populations to explain invasivesuccess has not received adequate attention (van Kleunenet al. 2011), despite early studies underlying this possi-bility (Elton 1958). In particular, native populationsadapted to human- modified habitats may be particu-larly prone to become invasive elsewhere (Ehrlich 1989).Human activities are now widely recognized as a majorforce promoting biological invasions (e.g. King andTschinkel 2008; Leprieur et al. 2008), both throughlarge-scale transport (Floerl and Inglis 2005; Suarez et al.2005; Tatem et al. 2006) and biotic homogenization (e.g.McKinney and Lockwood 1999; Olden et al. 2004; Mc-Kinney 2006). Human activities provide native specieswith an opportunity to cross habitat boundaries locally,and to adapt to human- driven biotic and abiotic condi-tions within their native range (i.e., pre-adapt). In addi-tion to triggering a general decrease in speciesabundance, functional diversity and other biotic effects(Olden et al. 2004; Ekroos et al. 2010), human activitiestend to alter the abiotic properties of habitats, such assoil chemical and physical features, water resources andproperties, air filtering, light incidence, and climatic con-ditions (Pickett et al. 2001; Kozlov and Zvereva 2007;Hrodey et al. 2009). Native populations adapting locallyto such profound changes to their environment maysubsidiarily benefit from the opportunity for long-dis-tance dispersal provided by human activities. Forinstance, the worldwide airline transportation networkprovides numerous high capacity routes between geo-graphically distant, but climatically similar locations(Tatem and Hay 2007). Native species that adapted tohuman- modified habitats are thus likely to access newareas characterized by similar habitat alterations, poten-tially multiple times, following human-driven introduc-tion events (e.g. McKinney 2006; Foucaud et al. 2010;Hufbauer et al. 2012).Although the idea of human activities promoting inva-sion success through prior adaptations in the nativerange is not new (Elton 1958; Ehrlich 1989), a renewedattention has been turned to the study of the nativerange and evolutionary changes occurring before intro-duction (Lee and Gelembiuk 2008; Valery et al. 2009;Schlaepfer et al. 2010; Hufbauer et al. 2012). However,this interest has been mostly theoretical, and the impor-tance of prior adaptations to human-modified habitatsin generating successful invaders has seldom been stud-ied using natural populations (van Kleunen et al. 2010).Notable exceptions are studies comparing life-historytraits between native populations of invasive and non-invasive species (Chown et al. 2007; Schlaepfer et al.2010; Jenkins and Keller 2011; van Kleunen et al. 2011),or population history of native populations differing intheir physiological ability to invade novel habitats (Win-kler et al. 2008). These studies all underline the impor-tance of prior adaptations to human-modified, marginal,or fluctuating habitats within the native range inexplaining successful invasions events. However, the rela-tive contribution of prior adaptation and other processes(multiple introductions, post-introduction adaptation) toinvasion success remains speculative, given the scarcityof experimental studies of native populations of invasivespecies.Wasmannia auropunctata, an invasive ant speciesranked among the most destructive invaders worldwide(Lowe et al. 2000), presents the opportunity to test forthe hypothesis of important adaptations occurring withinthe native range before long-distance introductions. Pre-vious studies have shown that this ant underwent majorbiological shifts within its native range before the long-distance dispersal events leading to worldwide invasion.In natural areas of its native range (primary forests ofSouth America), W. auropunctata forms low-densitypopulations (Orivel et al. 2009). However, this ant hasalso successfully colonized human- modified habitatswithin its native range, and this habitat change was par-alleled by a striking switch in ecological dominance (butnot in social system; Foucaud et al. 2009; Orivel et al.2009). A switch in reproductive system also took placeat the time of habitat transition: primary forest popula-tions generally display a classical haplo-diploid reproduc-tive system (hereafter referred to as ‘sexual’), whereaspopulations from human-modified areas are almostentirely clonal, with a strong reduction in genetic vari-ability (Foucaud et al. 2007). All introduced populationsstudied to date appear to be drawn from dominant pop-ulations of human-modified habitats of the native rangeof the species (Foucaud et al. 2010), suggesting that eco-logical and reproductive shifts occurred within the nativerange before long-distance dispersal.We have previously shown that abiotic conditions dif-fer considerably between the natural and human-modi-fied environments of W. auropunctata in its native range(Orivel et al. 2009). Over the course of the year, tem-perature remains stable at values below 30°C andhumidity never drops below 80% in natural habitats,whereas in human-modified habitats, temperatures mayreach 40°C and humidity may drop to 50%. The workercaste, in charge of the foraging outside the colony, maybe particularly affected by these conditions. These722 © 2013 The Authors. Evolutionary Applications published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd 6 (2013) 721–734Thermotolerance adaptation in the native range Foucaud et al.abiotic differences clearly constitute a major ecologicalchallenge, which has apparently been met by somenative W. auropunctata populations. However, it remainsunknown whether populations from natural andhuman-modified habitats differ in their ability to toler-ate hot and dry abiotic conditions (hereafter referred toas ‘thermotolerance’, sensu lato), and whether putativedifferences in thermotolerance stem from local adapta-tion (Dybdahl and Kane 2005; Preisser et al. 2008) orphenotypic plasticity (Chown et al. 2007; Nya-mukondiwa et al. 2010).If both native and introduced populations from human-modified habitats can tolerate such conditions, and nativepopulations from natural habitats cannot, this would sup-port the scenario of an evolutionary shift in the nativerange before long-distance dispersal into the introducedrange. This has previously been shown to occur for lowerthermal limits of W. auropunctata, with a prior adaptationto cold in populations from Argentina, which allowed asuccessful remote introduction of the species in the Medi-terranean zone (Rey et al. 2012).A possible way for certain populations to tolerate diffi-cult abiotic conditions could be to display variation inworker body size. Worker body size has been shown to playan important role in thermotolerance in several ant species(Kaspari 1993). In particular, Cataglyphis velox workers,desert ants that have to deal with extreme heat, have beendemonstrated to make use of their large body size to forageat higher temperatures (Cerda and Retana 1997, 2000). InW. auropunctata, previous studies have shown that workersfrom populations established in the introduced range aresmaller than those found in the native range (McGlynn1999; Mikheyev and Mueller 2007). However, these studiesdid not compare the body sizes of native and introducedworkers originating from populations established in differ-ent habitats (i.e., natural versus human-modified habitats,as in this study).The main goal of this study was to investigate a putativeevolutionary shift within the native range before long-dis-tance dispersal that may indicate prior adaptation of cer-tain native populations to become invasive. We tackled thisquestion by testing in the laboratory the putative differ-ences in upper thermotolerance levels between a set ofnative populations from natural and human-modified hab-itats and introduced populations from human-modifiedhabitats. All tested populations have been genetically char-acterized at microsatellite markers to assess the genetic rela-tionships among them and among other worldwidepopulations. We further investigated whether observedthermotolerance differences were due to body size varia-tions. The possibility of prior adaptation to human-modi-fied habitats within the native range in explaining invasivesuccess is finally discussed.Materials and methodsSampling of live populations and setting of laboratorycoloniesWe collected ca. 140 queens and several thousand workersfrom 11 populations from natural and human-modifiedhabitats within the native range (i.e., French Guiana) andthe introduced range (i.e., Cameroon, Florida and NewCaledonia) of W. auropunctata (Fig. 1, Table 1) betweenDecember 2007 and March 2008.On the basis of our previous genetic studies of the sam-pled populations, we expected three of the sampled popula-tions to be sexual and eight to be clonal (Foucaud et al.2006, 2007). This was confirmed by genotyping a mini-mum of three queens and 30 workers from each populationat 33 microsatellite loci, as described in Fournier et al.(2005b) and Almany et al. (2009). The reproductive systemwas determined by visually inspecting genotypes and usinga program to identify identical multilocus genotypes thatwe had developed in Pascal object programming language(available upon request to the authors; see Foucaud et al.2007; Fournier et al. 2005a).All the populations sampled from natural habitats weresexual, whereas all the populations sampled in human-modified habitats were clonal: the factors ‘habitat’ and‘reproductive system’ are thus confounded. In previousstudies (e.g. Foucaud et al. 2007), we encountered, on veryrare occasions, clonal populations in natural habitats (onlytwice in French Guiana) and sexual populations in human-modified habitats (only once in French Guiana). As thesetypes of populations are extremely rare and difficult tosample, we were unable to include them in this study. Fur-thermore, clonal populations from natural habitats have sofar been sampled only from the canopy, whereas sexualpopulations are found only at ground level. It thereforeseems likely that clonal and sexual populations from natu-ral habitats do not share the same ecological niche. Wewere thus unable to assess the interaction between habitatand reproductive system in this study, essentially because itwas seldom present in the field.We set up 11 laboratory colonies (Table 1), consisting ofmore than ten queens and at least 500 workers originatingfrom three to 10 nests sampled in locations known to har-bor a single population (Foucaud et al. 2009). We couldgather many queens in each of the laboratory coloniesbecause both sexual and clonal populations from the wholerange ofW. auropunctata are polygynous (i.e., no transitionfrom monogyny to polygyny occurred in the course of theinvasion process; Foucaud et al. 2009; Orivel et al. 2009).These laboratory colonies were kept in a climate chamberat a constant temperature of 25°C, with a humidity of 60%to 70%. Food (sugar water and worms) and water wereprovided ad libitum once per week.© 2013 The Authors. Evolutionary Applications published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd 6 (2013) 721–734 723Foucaud et al.

Evolutionary Applications published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd 6 (2013) 721–734Thermotolerance adaptation in the native range Foucaud et al.Genetic relationships between populations tested forthermotoleranceTo investigate the putative adaptive evolution of a trait, itis important to compare populations sharing sufficientlyclose genetic relationships (e.g. Hufbauer et al. 2012). Pre-vious genetic studies demonstrated that all sampled nativepopulations from human- modified habitats originatedrecently from sampled native populations from naturalhabitats (Foucaud et al. 2007).Previous genetic studies of worldwide introductionroutes did not enable to directly link any introduced popu-lation to its exact native source population (Foucaud et al.2010). This is mostly due to the strong genetic structureuncovered in the native range of the species (Foucaud et al.2007). To validate the comparison between the three testedintroduced populations (Cameroon, Florida, New Caledo-nia) and the tested native populations (French Guiana), weinvestigated whether these introduced populations weregenetically closer to three alternative sets of native popula-tions from Brazil, Costa Rica or French Guiana. To thisaim, we genotyped at least 30 individual workers per sam-pled native and introduced population at 12 microsatellitemarkers (Fournier et al. 2005b) and added this new dataset to a previous data set investigating the worldwidegenetic variation of W. auropunctata (Foucaud et al. 2010).We performed three distinct population genetics analysesusing this global microsatellite data set. We first used thesoftware POPULATIONS (Langella 2002) to construct a den-drogram connecting worker populations using the Neigh-bor-Joining (NJ) algorithm (Saitou and Nei 1987). Thegenetic distance used was Chakraborty and Jin’s allele-shared distance (Chakraborty and Jin 1993). This distancewas averaged over all pairs of individuals belonging to pair-wise populations in order to obtain the genetic distancesbetween populations. Bootstrap values (with the locus as aunit) were calculated over 1000 iterations. Extended major-ity rule was applied to reconstruct the consensus tree. Simi-lar results were obtained using other genetic distances(including Nei’s chord distance, Cavalli-Sforza & Edwardsdistance and the proportion of shared alleles; Bowcocket al. 1994; Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards 1967; Nei et al.1983) and reconstruction algorithms (UPGMA and BioNJ;Gascuel 1997). These additional phylogenetic reconstruc-tions were obtained using MSA 4.05 for the computationof 10 000 bootstrapped distance matrices (Dieringer andSchl€otterer 2003) and the neighbor and consense programsof the PHYLIP package v3.69 for the tree reconstruction (Fel-senstein 2004). As second analysis, we computed a matrixincluding pairwise FST values between all sampled popula-tions using the estimator h of the parameter FST (Weir andCockerham 1984). We also performed an AMOVA analysisusing ARLEQUIN 3.5 (Excoffier and Lischer 2010) to measurethe partition of genetic variance between the introducedpopulations collected for the thermotolerance experimentsand each of the available native populations (Brazil, CostaRica and Guiana). As third analysis, we performed anexclusion analysis using GeneClass2 (Piry et al. 2004) tofurther investigate which native populations were geneti-cally the most likely sources of the individual genotypes ofthe sampled introduced populations collected for the ther-motolerance experiments.Thermotolerance assaysWe assessed the tolerance of the workers to abiotic condi-tions in a resistance test in which mortality rate was deter-mined in groups of workers. We placed ten individualworkers in a Petri dish sealed with a grid cover and main-tained the workers for 3 h at constant temperature andhumidity conditions within a climate chamber. The num-ber of dead workers at the end of this 3-h period was usedas a measurement of the thermotolerance (sensu lato, i.e.,including both tolerance to high temperature and to lowhygrometric conditions). Mortality was assessed visually byfour experimenters that were randomized according totreatments and populations tested.Workers from laboratory colonies were tested more than40 days after sampling, to ensure that all the workers testedhad been produced in the laboratory and not sampled fromthe field (the life expectancy of W. auropunctata workers isabout 30 days, (Ulloa-Chacon 1990). This time lag to thestart of the experiments minimized the impact of the accli-mation factor in the interpretation of our results. In addi-tion, evaluation of the impact of acclimation on themeasure of upper thermal limit in Linepithema humileshows that in our case of 25°C acclimation temperatureand a high rate of temperature change, no acclimationTable 1.

Similarexperiments carried out on workers from colonies housedin the laboratory for more than a year provided qualita-tively similar results, confirming that acclimation is unli-kely to account for our findings (data not shown).Preliminary experiments were conducted in the labora-tory on one sexual population from a natural habitat (M7)and one clonal population from a human-modified habitat(Ker), to determine the range of temperature and humidityconditions yielding moderate to high worker mortalityrates. We studied a total of 14 250 workers in 39 combina-tions of temperature (seven values from 25°C to 42°C) andhumidity conditions (seven values from 100% to 25%; seeFig. S1 for details). On the basis of the findings of thesepreliminary experiments, we chose four temperature andhumidity combinations giving moderate to high workermortality rates for the main experiment: 36°C – 55%, 38°C– 65%, 39°C – 70% and 40°C – 75%. According to the pre-liminary data (Fig. S2), the chosen temperature- humiditycombinations represent adequate conditions to detect dif-ferences in mortality between the two types of populations.During the main experiment following our preliminarytests, we tested a total of 8790 workers as follows. For eachof the four chosen sets of abiotic conditions, we tested all11 laboratory colonies twice, using ten Petri dishes of tenindividuals (i.e., 4 conditions * 11 colonies * ten Petridishes * two runs = 880 Petri dishes, minus one missing).All eight assays were conducted in the same climate cham-ber, in which two Petri dishes per colony per run wereplaced at random positions on five vertical racks. As before,we recorded the proportion of dead workers per Petri dish(i.e., the mortality rate). We performed a control consistingin holding one additional Petri dish per tested laboratorycolony (with 10 individual workers) at laboratory condi-tions (25°C – 60–70% RH) during the 3 h of each run, tomonitor putative mortality due to the treatment itself.Statistical analysis of thermotoleranceOur main goal was to investigate putative differences in abi-otic tolerance between populations of different origins(native natural, native human-modified and introducedhuman-modified), through the use of a statistical model.Explanatory variables consisted only in categorical factors.We used five categorical factors: ‘type’ (corresponding tothe three different types of habitat), ‘pop’ (the sampled pop-ulation), ‘cond’ (the tested temperature- humidity condi-tions), ‘rep’ (the number of the replicate, from one to two),and ‘rack’ (the vertical position of the Petri dish in the cli-mate chamber, from rack 1 to rack 5). Note that ‘pop’ wasnested within ‘type’ and that the variable ‘rep’ was nestedwithin ‘cond’ (hereafter denoted ‘pop(type)’ and ‘rep(cond)’). Both the ‘pop’ and ‘rep’ factors were treated asrandom effects, whereas the remaining factors (‘cond’, ‘rack’and ‘type’) were treated as fixed effects. For the purposes ofinterpretation, only the following interactions were includedin the full model: cond*type, cond*pop(type), rack*pop(type), rack*rep(cond) and rep(cond)*pop(type). Giventhat the response variable was a proportion, we assumed abinomial distribution.With fixed and random effects and a binomially distrib-uted independent variable, we ran a generalized linearmixed model with a logit link function (Zuur et al. 2009).We were principally interested in estimating the magnitudeof the difference in mortality rates between the three typesof population, while correcting for several clustering factors(e.g., population). We therefore used Penalized Quasi-Like-lihood methods (PQL; Breslow and Clayton 1993), asimplemented in SAS 9.1, to fit the model (PROC GLIM-MIX, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). PQL methods mayyield biased estimates of variance components in some situ-ations (Lin and Breslow 1996). However, on the basis ofprevious work (Breslow and Clayton 1993; Breslow and Lin1995; Bolker et al. 2009), we conclude that our estimatesmay only be subject to a negligible bias, given that (i) thedata were only slightly unbalanced, (ii) all fixed effectsreached high levels of significance, and (iii) all variancecomponent estimates were small (<0.36) and the overdi-spersion coefficient was moderate (1.53, see below). Thesignificance of fixed effects was assessed through approxi-mate F-tests and the number of denominator degrees offreedom for each test was computed using the Kenward-Roger approximation (Bolker et al. 2009).It is worth stressing that our full model yielded an esti-mate of 0 for the variance component of the interactionbetween replicate and vertical position within the climatechamber [i.e., ‘rack*rep(cond)’] and the interactionbetween the type of habitat and the conditions tested (i.e.,‘type*cond’) was clearly non-significant (F[6, 25.8] = 1.15,P = 0.36). Therefore, as suggested by Zuur et al. (2009),we fitted a second model from which these two terms wereremoved. With this model, the coefficient of overdispersionwas moderate (1.53 SE = 0.08), estimates of variance com-ponents were not large (i.e., 1; Lin and Breslow 1996)and all fixed effects other than the conditions tested(‘cond’) gave small P-values (see Table 2). This secondmodel was therefore selected for subsequent analyses.Effect of body size on thermotoleranceWe tested for a possible effect of body size on our thermotol-erance results, by investigating worker body size in fivenative populations – two from natural habitats (M3-F andM11) and three from human-modified habitats (Ker, P2-2and Cay) – and two introduced populations (New Caledo-nia and Australia). The introduced Australian population,726 © 2013 The Authors. Evolutionary Applications published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd 6 (2013) 721–734Thermotolerance adaptation in the native range Foucaud et al.which was not tested in our main thermotolerance assay, haspreviously been shown to be clonal Foucaud et al. 2010, andsubsequently to exhibit thermotolerance levels similar tothose of other introduced populations (results not shown).We collected and point-mounted 20 foraging workers fromeach population. Multifocus images (x40) of worker headswere acquired with a GT Entovision System and Archime-dTM software (Microvision Instruments, Evry, France).Four morphological parameters of the head were measuredon each worker (maximum head width, maximum headlength, and head width in front of and behind the eyes) withCartograph software (Microvision Instruments).Preliminary analysis showed that all morphometric mea-surements were highly correlated (all Pearson’s product-moment correlations > 0.66). Thus, as maximum headwidth is often considered a standard proxy for body size(H€olldobler and Wilson 1990), we used only this morpho-logical variable for subsequent analyses. After testing fornormality and variance homogeneity, we investigated puta-tive differences in body size between populations originat-ing from different habitats in both ranges (native natural,native human-modified, and introduced human-modi-fied), by fitting a linear mixed model implemented in R(R Development Core Team 2005) and including the fol-lowing factors: ‘type’ (fixed factor corresponding to ourthree types of population) and ‘pop’ (random factor corre-sponding to the sampled population, nested within ‘type’).We additionally investigated whether mean values ofthermotolerance were related to mean body size at thepopulation level for the six populations for which measure-ments were available for both traits. After checking forbinormality of the data, we conducted a Pearson’s product-moment correlation test using R.ResultsGenetic relationships between populationsThe NJ tree presented in Fig. 1B shows that the col-lected native Guianese populations group together withthe introduced populations used in our thermotoleranceexperiments (New Caledonia, Cameroon, and to a lesserextent Florida). The support for the deepest nodes ofthe tree was however low (bootstrap values below20%), due at least partly to a too low number of mi-crosatellite markers and an incomplete sampling giventhe substantial genetic structure at small geographicscale in the native range of this species Foucaud et al.2009;. Low node values were also somewhat expectedgiven the strong bottleneck events endured by clonalpopulations (i.e., an equivalent of only two effectiveindividuals, one haploid male and one diploid femaleand hence a maximum of three alleles per locus), likelynegatively influencing our ability to reconstruct a cor-rect phylogeny (Takezaki and Nei 1996; Estoup andGuillemaud 2010). All distances and reconstructionalgorithms however yielded similar topologies (resultsnot shown).The pairwise FST values calculated among all populationssampled in the distribution range of W. auropunctatashowed that our focal introduced populations used forthermotolerance experiments were genetically closer tonative Guianese populations than to any other samplednative populations (Brazil and Costa Rica; Fig. S2). Inagreement with this, the AMOVA analysis showed that theleast amount of genetic variance was partitioned betweenthe focal introduced populations and Guianese popula-tions: 5.52% of genetic variation versus 11.52% and12.44% for the Brazilian and Costa Rican populations,respectively.Exclusion analysis results indicated that all native pop-ulations were statistically excluded as the source with aprobability P < 0.01 for all individuals of our focal pop-ulations. This result suggests that we did not sample theexact source location of the studied introduced popula-tions. It is worth noting, however, that in the case of anextreme reduction of genetic variability (which is thecase in bottlenecked introduced W. auropunctata popula-tions), the GeneClass2 algorithm may fail to assign indi-viduals to their true source with a high probability dueto strong drift effect. In agreement with the FST andAMOVA results, the likelihood ratio scores provided byGeneClass2 for each introduced individual showed thatthe Guianese populations were however the most likelysources when compared to any other sampled nativepopulation (Brazil and Costa Rica).Overall, our genetic analyses suggest that (i) althoughstrong bottleneck events most likely substantiallyinflated genetic differentiation, it was unlikely that thesampled Guianese populations were the exact source(s)of the introduced populations tested for thermotoler-ance experiments, but that (ii) among available nativepopulations (Brazil, Costa Rica and Guiana), all testedTable 2.

Therefore, althoughthe genetic relationships between the native and intro-duced populations were not fully resolved, the choiceof Guianese populations to represent the native rangeconstituted the best option available to test for anadaptive shift between W. auropunctata populationsfrom the native and introduced ranges. In addition, aprevious microsatellite study investigating the geneticrelationships between individuals from Guianese nativepopulations showed that sexual populations from natu-ral habitats were the recent source of the clonal popu-lations found in human-modified habitats (Foucaudet al. 2007). The present microsatellite data and statisti-cal treatments confirmed this close genetic relationshipand hence validate the phenotypic comparison of thesampled native populations to investigate a putativeadaptive shift within the native range of W. auropunc-tata.Thermotolerance assaysMortality rate was significantly higher for workers of popu-lations from natural habitats of the native range (NaN)than for workers of populations from human-modifiedhabitats of the native (NaH) or introduced ranges (IntH)[mortalityNaN = 0.79, IC95% = (0.60; 0.91); mortal-ityNaH = 0.29, IC95% = (0.16; 0.47); mortalityIntH = 0.21,IC95% = (0.09; 0.40); tNaN-NaH, 7.94 = 4.97, P = 0.0011and tNaN-IntH, 7.85 = 4.63, P = 0.0018; Fig. 2; Fig. S3 andS4]. In contrast, no significant difference was foundbetween the mortality rates of the workers of populationsfrom human-modified habitats of the native and intro-duced ranges (tNaH-IntH,7.85 = 0.95, P = 0.37).We also found a significant condition effect (Fig. 2;Table 2), meaning that our four sets of conditionsresulted in moderate to high mortality rates, as expectedon the basis of our preliminary results (summarized inFig. S1). The lack of interaction between the factors‘type of population’ and ‘condition’ indicates a constantrelationship between population type and mortality frommoderate to harsh abiotic conditions (Fig. 2). However,without a priori power computations, we cannot discarddefinitively that these interactions existed and were notsignificant because of a lack of power. The vertical posi-tion of the Petri dish within the climate chamber had asignificant effect on worker mortality rate (Table 2). Thiseffect was expected, given the pitfalls of current climatechamber technology (i.e., the occurrence of vertical gra-dients), and was controlled through the equilibration ofour experimental design (i.e., equal mixing of all popu-lations at each vertical position within the climate cham-ber). Importantly, no mortality occurred in the controlPetri dishes held at laboratory conditions (i.e., no differ-ence in mortality between populations at laboratoryconditions).Body size and thermotoleranceMaximum individual head width was normally distrib-uted (Shapiro–Wilk test: W = 0.989, P = 0.41) and indi-vidual variances were homogeneous for workers fromdifferent population types – that is, for workers fromnative natural, native human-modified, and introducedhuman-modified habitats (Brown-Forsythe Levene-typetest: P > 0.09). The linear mixed model analysis revealedthat the type of population factor was not significant(v² = 0.6287, P = 0.73; Fig. 3). Workers thus had similarbody sizes regardless of their habitat of origin (i.e.,native natural, native human-modified, and introducedhuman-modified).Furthermore, there was no linear relationship betweenmean values of thermotolerance and body size at thepopulation level (Fig. S5).

Evolutionary Applications published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd 6 (2013) 721–734Thermotolerance adaptation in the native range Foucaud et al.correlation test indicated no significant correlationbetween mean thermotolerance and body size values(t = 0.9471, df = 4, P = 0.3972).DiscussionAdaptive shift between natural and human-modifiedhabitats within the native rangeOur thermotolerance study indicated that a major pheno-typic transition likely occurred within the native range ofW. auropunctata. Workers from native sexual populationssampled in natural habitats were less tolerant to hot anddry conditions than both native and introduced clonalpopulations sampled in human-modified habitats. In con-trast, populations established in human-modified habitatsin the native and introduced ranges displayed similar,higher levels of thermotolerance. The fact that native popu-lations from natural and human-modified habitats shareclose genetic relationships indicate that an adaptive shiftmost likely occurred within the native range of W. auro-punctata, before long-distance dispersal. On the otherhand, the less robust genetic relationships observedbetween the sampled native and introduced populationsmake it more difficult to unambiguously conclude that thehigh level of thermotolerance of introduced populationsderived from the prior adaptation of native Guianese pop-ulations in human-modified habitats.A previous study has shown that climatic conditions dif-fer considerably between adjacent natural and human-modified habitats in the native range of W. auropunctata,with the latter reaching higher temperatures and lowerhumidity (Orivel et al. 2009). Some of the abiotic condi-tions tested in our study correspond to the worst possibleconditions found in the field during an 18-month period,rather than to conditions likely to be experienced on a reg-ular basis by workers. However, the higher mortality ratesfor workers from native natural habitats populations in thetested abiotic conditions likely translate in a lower foragingefficiency and lower fitness in native human-modified habi-tats when compared to heat- tolerant populations. Consis-tent with this hypothesis, Cerda et al. (1998) have shownthat, in a Mediterranean ant community, heat-tolerant spe-cies have a higher foraging efficiency at high temperaturesthan heat-intolerant species.In invasive organisms, including insects, it has beenshown that wider thermotolerance abilities can stem eitherfrom local adaptation (e.g., in the snail Potamopyrgus anti-podarum, in the elongate hemlock scale Fiorinia externa;Dybdahl and Kane 2005; Preisser et al. 2008), or from phe-notypic plasticity (e.g., in invasive springtail species, in theMediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata; Chown et al.2007; Nyamukondiwa et al. 2010). Given our care to avoidacclimation as a possible alternative explanation (even ifmaternal effect has not been ruled out) through our com-mon-garden experiment, it is likely that the specific abiotictolerance of populations present in human-modified habi-tats arose as local adaptation within the native range and isnot the product of phenotypic plasticity. The relative extentof phenotypic plasticity of native and introduced popula-tions in thermal traits remains to be explored, however, asthis may contribute to the successful establishment of pop-ulations in dramatically different climatic areas (e.g., therecent invasion of W. auropunctata in Israel).These findings highlight the importance of selective pro-cesses due to human activities within the native range. Theswitch from heat-intolerant sexual populations confined tonatural moist and cool habitats to heat-tolerant clonal pop-ulations establishing in hot and dry human-modified habi-tats is probably a first step toward invasive success, as itallows the species to gain access to new resources and tonew transport opportunities, specific to human areas.These results are consistent with the ‘two-step’ scenario ofinvasion process put forward by Foucaud et al. (2010),which is largely based on the potential of native popula-tions to evolve under direct human pressure on landscapeproperties (see also Hufbauer et al. 2012). It is worth not-ing, however, that the current study does not strictlyFigure 3 Maximum head width of workers from the three populationtypes.

Evolutionary Applications published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd 6 (2013) 721–734 729Foucaud et al. Thermotolerance adaptation in the native rangedemonstrate the ‘two-step’ scenario in the case of the ther-motolerance adaptation of W. auropunctata populations.To definitively prove this ‘two-step’ scenario, one wouldadditionally require the demonstration of direct geneticrelationships between tested native and introduced popula-tions, which was not the case in the present study. Giventhe strong genetic structure found in native populations ata small geographic scale (Foucaud et al. 2009), a strictdemonstration of the two-step scenario for upper thermallimits may prove difficult using W. auropunctata as a modelspecies.The two-step scenario of prior adaptation in the nativerange before successful long- distance introduction hashowever been demonstrated in a recent study of the evolu-tion of cold tolerance in native and introduced populationsof W. auropunctata (Rey et al. 2012). This study showedthat the Israeli population, thriving in the colder Mediter-ranean climate, derived from cold-adapted native popula-tions of Argentina. Most importantly, studies of bothupper and lower thermal limits in W. auropunctata showeda similar pattern of local adaptation within the native rangebefore dispersal (Rey et al. 2012; this study). These resultscall for a wider appreciation of both native and introducedpopulation variation when investigating the evolution ofphenotypic traits during invasions. An important differencebetween studies of lower and upper thermotolerance in W.auropunctata lies in the nature of the associated selectionpressure. Indeed, the study of cold thermotolerance in W.auropunctata pointed to a naturally occurring local adapta-tion at the southern margin of the native range as instru-mental in explaining the establishment of the species in atemperate area (Rey et al. 2012). On the contrary, thisstudy of upper thermal abilities pointed to the role ofhuman selective pressures as the main instrumental factorof the evolution of locally adapted thermotolerant nativepopulations. While naturally occurring gradients are likelyto produce new adaptations that are predictable in geo-graphic and phenotypic spaces, adaptations to human-modified ecosystems appear much less predictable, becauseof more abrupt ecological variation and their network-likespatial organization over distribution ranges. To our view,these different types of selective pressure are thus notequally predictable and likely offer different challenges forthe management of invasive species.The hypothesis of human selective pressures modifyingspecies within their native range, driving them towardinvasive characteristics, is supported by a growing numberof studies on various species. For instance, the ant Tapino-ma sessile, native to America, is showing a striking transi-tion in social system between populations from naturalhabitats and populations from highly urbanized habitatswithin its own native range (Buczkowski 2010). The urbanpopulations also developed invasive characteristics withinthe native range, such as improved demography and eco-logical dominance. In this species, the role of human dis-turbance in the form of urbanization has been clearlydemonstrated (Buczkowski 2010; Menke et al. 2010).Unsurprisingly given the dispersal opportunities providedby human- dominated landscapes, it has recently beenfound to form an invasive population in Hawaii (Buczkow-ski and Krushelnycky 2012). Agricultural activities alsocause major changes in the biology of native species (e.g.,distribution, migration, dominance, demography), espe-cially with novel perturbation regimes or the introductionof new hosts (Via 1990). In the butterfly Euphydryas editha,a host plant shift occurred within 10 years following theintroduction by humans of two plant species, Plantagolanceolata and Collinsia torreyi, during logging and cattleranching in previous natural habitats (Singer et al. 1993).The reproductive output of E. editha has been shown to bemuch higher on its new hosts (Singer et al. 1993; Singerand Thomas 1996) and, if its potential for migration werenot so low (Brussard and Ehrlich 1970), it might have colo-nized vast areas in which its new hosts were introducedthrough agriculture (e.g., in California and Nevada). Insome cases, host-switching species evolve invasive features,thrive in their human-modified native range and eventuallyinvade remote areas. This was the case for the Coloradopotato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, which switchedfrom its historical Solanum hosts to Solanum tuberosumfollowing its introduction for farming. It subsequentlyinvaded North America, Europe, and Asia to become themost threatening pest of potato crops (Alyokhin et al.2008).In another widely studied invasive ant species, L. humile,a recent study has also underlined the significance of bothclimatic suitability and human disturbance as key determi-nants of invasion success (Roura-Pascual et al. 2011). It ishowever important to note that other factors such as thelevel of biotic interactions can still be relevant to explainsome local distribution in W. auropunctata (Le Bretonet al. 2007), as well as in L. humile (Roura-Pascual et al.2011).Effect of body size on thermotoleranceIn some ant species, differences in thermotolerance can beaccounted for by differences in worker body size (Kaspari1993; Clemencet et al. 2010). For instance, large Catagly-phis velox workers withstand temperatures 6–8°C higherthan those tolerated by smaller workers (Cerda and Retana1997). However, morphological measurements indicatedthat this was not the case in W. auropunctata, as workers ofboth heat-tolerant populations (i.e., established in human-modified habitats in both the native and the introducedrange) and heat-intolerant populations (i.e., established in730 © 2013 The Authors. Evolutionary Applications published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd 6 (2013) 721–734Thermotolerance adaptation in the native range Foucaud et al.natural habitats) had bodies of similar size. McGlynn(1999) and Mikheyev and Mueller (2007) found that work-ers from introduced populations were smaller than those ofnative populations, based on a wide geographic samplingrange. Additional Student’s t-tests on pairs of populationtypes revealed only a non- significant trend of this type inour own data set (results not shown). Most importantly,the goal of our morphological analysis was to assess thepossible relationship between body size and levels of ther-motolerance in population samples for which we had ther-motolerance data. In that respect, we found no significantassociation between these two variables. Thermotolerancein W. auropunctata is therefore probably achieved throughphysiological, biochemical, or behavioral processes, orthrough a combination of such processes, rather thanthrough an increase in body size. For example, in the smallworkers of thermophilic C. rosenhaueri, thermotoleranceresults partly from an increase in metabolic rate and adecrease in cuticular water loss, together with differences inbody posture (Cerda and Retana 2000).Physiological or other processes explaining the polymor-phism in thermotolerance remain to be investigated inW. auropunctata. In addition to other experimental investi-gations, direct approaches using functional loci could beenvisaged to study the genetic determinism of thermotoler-ance in W. auropunctata. Our thermotolerance assays couldthus be complemented with transcriptomic data, throughthe use of dedicated microarrays or investigation of theexpression patterns of candidate genes, such as genes fromthe heat-shock protein family (e.g. Dahlgaard et al. 1998;Fangue et al. 2006).Alternative adaptive scenariosOur microsatellite data set showed that the three testedintroduced populations were genetically closer to the nativepopulations investigated here for thermotolerance than toany other sampled native populations, but failed to proveclose genetic relationships between tested native and intro-duced populations. Some unsampled native populationsare thus probably the source(s) for the three introducedpopulations studied here. If such unsampled native sourcepopulations would not show any increased thermotoler-ance level, one would then favor a scenario in which adap-tation occurred in the introduced range, after long-distancedispersal. However, we advocate that the present knowl-edge of the biology of W. auropunctata renders this alterna-tive scenario far less parsimonious than the scenario ofprior adaptation in the native range, before long-distancedispersal.First, whatever the precise origin of the introduced pop-ulations, our results showed that a phenotypic shift in ther-motolerance occurred within the native range, most likelythrough a local adaptation process. The close genetic rela-tionship between the native populations from natural andhuman-modified habitats tested in this study is undisputed(Foucaud et al. 2007, 2009). As a consequence, we demon-strated here that, at least, prior adaptation can occur in thenative range of W. auropunctata. Any hypothetical scenarioinvolving adaptation after long-distance dispersal wouldhence also have to consider the simultaneous occurrence ofan adaptive shift within the native range, before long-dis-tance dispersal.Second, it is important to note that thermotoleranceis not the only phenotypic trait for which it has beendemonstrated that a shift occurred within the nativerange of W. auropunctata between natural versushuman-modified populations, and that native and intro-duced populations from human-modified habitats werephenotypically closer to each other than to natural pop-ulations from the native range. As a matter of fact, eco-logical dominance (Orivel et al. 2009) and reproductivesystem polymorphism (Foucaud et al. 2009) follow thesame pattern. Therefore, as more traits accumulate toreveal patterns of phenotypic shifts occurring in thenative range and later observed overall the introducedrange, it becomes more parsimonious to consider thatmultiple adaptations occurred at most a few timeswithin the native range prior to long-distance dispersalthan independently for multiple traits in multiple intro-duced populations after long-distance dispersal.ConclusionsThis study highlights the importance of human land usein bringing about major contemporary evolutionarychanges within the native range of species. Those adapta-tions to human habitats in the native range might consti-tute prior adaptations when introduced in remote humanhabitats, often showing little variability. This human-induced process may hence ultimately pave the way forthe emergence of new bioinvaders. Human modificationsof ecosystems are usually substantial, so most species mayfail to cross such large valleys in the adaptive landscape(see Lenormand 2002; Ravigne et al. 2009; Ronce andKirkpatrick 2001 for theoretical studies on this subject).However, W. auropunctata provides a striking example ofa species that eventually crossed such a valley within itsnative range, thereby gaining access to new resources andnew areas. This may not be an uncommon process, con-sidering that most of the worst cases of biological invasionare committed by human commensals (Ehrlich 1989;Lowe et al. 2000). More empirical studies within thenative and introduced ranges of invaders are needed todraw more general and firmer conclusions on the relativecontribution of prior adaptations (with a special emphasis© 2013 The Authors.

This latter pointis crucial to help building managing policies to preventinvasions worldwide.AcknowledgementsWe thank Gary Morton for providing the W. auropunctataindividuals from Australia used for morphological analyses.JF thanks Aude Gilabert for support.

biotic resistance hypothesis,86312089,Quantitative relationship between antibiotic exposure and the acquisition and transmission of resistance in bacteria in the laboratory,,"Händel, N.",2015,"The worldwide emergence and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria represent a major threat to human health care as the chance of therapy failure and costs for treatment increase. To curb the continuous rise of drug resistant bacteria worldwide, new strategies are urgently needed that counteract the development and spread of resistance. Development of innovative countermeasures depends on a deeper understanding of how sensitive and drug resistant bacteria respond to different drug levels, circumvent metabolic costs and the development of knowledge of the factors that can affect the acquisition of drug resistance. Therefore, the main object of this thesis was to characterize and quantify the relationship between antibiotic usage and development and transmission of resistance using laboratory cultures of E. coli as a model. The genetic and physiological changes that were shown in this study to accompany the acquisition of resistance indicate that bacteria are able to acquire resistance and compensate for metabolic costs due to various and highly flexible strategies. In addition, in vitro conjugation rates of a plasmid that confers antibiotic resistance and that originated from a food isolate was dependent on cell density, energy availability, growth rate and antibiotic concentration. The outcome of this thesis contributes to the current knowledge regarding the development and spread of resistance in bacteria and could be used as basis for further studies on molecular regulatory mechanisms involved in the acquisition of antibiotic resistance",,info:eu-repo/semantics/doctoralthesis,,,

Although resistance  is a well-accepted phenomenon, less clear are the processes that  contribute most to it, and whether those processes are strong enough to  completely repel invaders. Current perceptions of strong,  competition-driven biotic resistance stem from classic ecological  theory, Elton\u27s formulation of ecological resistance, and the general  acceptance of the enemies-release hypothesis. We conducted a  meta-analysis of the plant invasions literature to quantify the  contribution of resident competitors, diversity, herbivores and soil  fungal communities to biotic resistance. Results indicated large  negative effects of all factors except fungal communities on invader  establishment and performance. Contrary to predictions derived from the  natural enemies hypothesis, resident herbivores reduced invasion success  as effectively as resident competitors. Although biotic resistance  significantly reduced the establishment of individual invaders, we found  little evidence that species interactions completely repelled  invasions. We conclude that ecological interactions rarely enable  communities to resist invasion, but instead constrain the abundance of  invasive species once they have successfully established",,text,"competition, fungal community, herbivory, invasion, species diversity, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology",,'Wiley'
biotic resistance hypothesis,237407301,Biotic resistance to invasion is ubiquitous across ecosystems of the United States,,"Beaury, Evelyn M., Finn, John T, Corbin, Jeffrey D., Barr, Valerie, Bradley, Bethany A",2019,"The biotic resistance hypothesis predicts that diverse native communities are more resistant to invasion. However, past studies vary in their support for this hypothesis due to an apparent contradiction between experimental studies, which support biotic resistance, and observational studies, which find that native and non-native species richness are positively related at broad scales (small scale studies are more variable). Here, we present a novel analysis of the biotic resistance hypothesis using 24,456 observations of plant richness spanning four community types and seven ecoregions of the United States. Non-native plant occurrence was negatively related to native plant richness across all community types and ecoregions, although the strength of biotic resistance varied across different ecological, anthropogenic, and climatic contexts. Our results strongly support the biotic resistance hypothesis, thus reconciling differences between experimental and observational studies and providing evidence for the shared benefits between invasive species management and native biodiversity conservation.https://scholarworks.umass.edu/data/1109/thumbnail.jp",,text,"data, dataset, biotic resistance",,ScholarWorks@UMass Amherst

biotic resistance hypothesis,91076843,The integrated concept of disease resistance; a new view including horizontal and vertical resistance in plants,10.1007/bf00032062,"Parlevliet, J.E., Zadoks, J.C.",1977,"Horizontal, uniform, race-non-specific or stable resistance can be discerned according to Van der Plank, from vertical, differential, race-specific or unstable resistance by a test in which a number of host genotypes (cultivars or clones) are tested against a number of pathogen genetypes traces of isolatest. If the total non-environmental variance in levels of resistance is due to main effects only differences between cultivars and differences between isolates) the resistance and the pathogen many (in the broad sense) are horizontal in nature. Vertical resistance and pathogenicity are characterized by the interaction between host and pathogen showing up as a variance compenent in this test due to interaction between cultivars and isolates. A host and pathogen model was made in which resistance and pathogenicity are governed by live polygenic loci. Within the host the resistance genes show additivity. Two models were investigated in model I resistance and pathogenicity genes operate in an additive way as envisaged by Van der Plank in his horizontal resistance. Model II is characterized by a gene-for-gene action between the polygenes of the host and those of the pathogen. The cultivar isolate test in model I showed only main effect variance. Surprisingly, the variance in model II was also largely due to main effects. The contribution of the interaction to the variance uppeared so small, that it would be difficult to discern it from a normal error variance. So-called horizontal resistance can therefore be explained by a polygenic resistance, where the individual genes are vertical and operating on a gene-for-gene basis with virulence genes in the pathogen. The data reported so far support the idea that model II rather than model I is the realistic one. The two models also revealed that populations with a polygenic resistance based on the gene-for-gene action have an increased level of resistance compared with the addition model, while its stability as far as mutability of the pathogen is concerned, is higher compared to those with an additive gene action. Mathematical studies of Mode too support the gene-for-gene concept. The operation of all resistance and virulence genes in a natural population is therefore seen as one integrated system. All genes for true resistance in the host population, whether they are major or minor genes are considered to interact in a gene-for-gene way with virulence genes either major or minor, in the pathogen population. The models revealed other important aspects. Populations with a polygenic resistance based on a gene-for-gene action have an increased level of resistance compared to populations following the addition model. The stability, as far as mutability of the pathogen is concerned, is higher in the interaction model than in the addition model. The effect of a resistance gene on the level of resistance of the population consists of its effect on a single plant times its gene frequency in the population. Due to the adaptive forces in both the host and the pathogen population and the gene-for-gene nature of the gene action an equilibrium develops that allows all resistance genes to remain effective although their corresponding virulence genes are present. The frequencies of the resistance and virulence genes are such that the effective frequencies of resistance genes tend to be negatively related to the magnitude of the gene effect. This explains why major genes often occur at low frequencies, while minor genes appear to be frequent. It is in this way that the host and the pathogen, both as extremely variable and vigorous populations, can co-exist. Horizontal and vertical resistance as meant by Van der Plank therefore do not represent different kinds of resistances, they represent merely polygenic and oligogenic resistances resp. In both situations the individual host genes interact specifically with virulence genes in the pathogen. Van der Plank's test for horizontal resistance appears to be a simple and sound way to test for polygenic inheritance of resistance. The practical considerations have been discussed. The agro-ecosystems should be made as diverse as possible.

To manage this issue, we need to deeply understand the influencing factors and mechanisms. Based on the background of livestock husbandry, this paper reviews the factors that affect the acquisition of bacterial resistance. Meanwhile, the resistance mechanism is also discussed. “Survival of the fittest” is the result of genetic plasticity of bacterial pathogens, which brings about specific response, such as producing adaptive mutation, gaining genetic material or changing gene expression. To a large extent, bacterial populations acquire resistance genes directly caused by the selective pressure of antibiotics. However, mobile resistance genes may be co-selected by other existing substances (such as heavy metals and biocides) without direct selection pressure from antibiotics. This is because the same mobile genetic elements as antibiotic resistance genes can be co-located by the resistance determinants of some of these compounds. Furthermore, environmental factors are a source of resistance gene acquisition. Here, we describe some of the key measures that should be taken to mitigate the risk of antibiotic resistance. We call on the relevant governments or organizations around the world to formulate and improve the monitoring policies of antibiotic resistance, strengthen the supervision, strengthen the international cooperation and exchange, and curb the emergence and spread of drug-resistant strains",,article,"acquired resistance, antibiotic, heavy metal, biocide, resistance mechanism, mitigation measures, Veterinary medicine, SF600-1100",issn:2673-6225,'Frontiers Media SA'
biotic resistance hypothesis,584954376,Growth rate and life history shape plant resistance.,10.5281/zenodo.6547494,"Jacobsen, Deidra J.",2022,"Premise: Plant defenses are shaped by many factors, including herbivory, lifespan, and mating system. Predictions about plant defense and resistance are often based on resource allocation trade‐offs with plant growth and reproduction. Additionally, two types of plant resistance, constitutive and induced resistance, are predicted to be evolutionary alternatives or redundant strategies. Given the variety of plant trait combinations and non‐mutually exclusive predictions, examining resistance strategies in related species with different combinations of growth and reproductive traits is important to tease apart roles of plant traits and evolutionary history on plant resistance.  Methods: Phylogenetic comparative methods were used to examine the potentially interacting influences of life history (annual/perennial), mating system (self‐compatible/self-incompatible), and species growth rates on constitutive resistance and inducibility (additional resistance following damage) across Physalis species (Solanaceae).  Results: Resistance was evolutionarily labile, and there was no correlation between constitutive resistance and inducibility. Annual species with fast growth rates displayed higher constitutive resistance, but growth rate did not affect constitutive resistance in perennials. In contrast, inducibility was negatively associated with species growth rate regardless of life history or mating system.  Conclusions: The different effects of plant life history and growth rate on constitutive resistance and inducibility indicate that defensive evolution is unconstrained by a trade‐off between resistance types. The interactions among plant life history, growth, and herbivore resistance show that plant defense is shaped not only by herbivore environment, but also by plant traits that reflect a plant's evolutionary history and local selective pressures",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/other, dataset",,,

Fortunately, it is possible to study some of the mechanisms of drug resistance, even at a biophysical or biochemical level, without necessarily knowing very much about how the drug works—just as it is possible to study (at least at a biological level) the question of how micro-organisms become resistant, without under-standing the biochemical basis of the resistance mechanism itself.

But how often does biotic resistance prevent the damaging monocultures that typify the most problematic plant invaders, and how often is biotic resistance overwhelmed by the direct and indirect impacts of human activities? This chapter attempts to answer these questions, drawing on the long history of research into biotic resistance. We first briefly describe the major forms of biotic resistance to exotic plant invasions as an antecedent to other, more detailed chapters on competition, herbivory and pathogens. We then describe a new neutral model where variance in disturbance promotes invasions over the short term, but over longer timescales only propagule pressure drives invasions. These findings are a cautionary tale; pending increases in global trade and travel, particularly to the tropics, may provide the prerequisite disturbance and propagule pressure needed to ultimately stoke further invasions. Finally, we highlight case studies where invasions have been mitigated by restoration of biotic resistance from native herbivores and competitors. These studies provide strong empirical support that conservation of native biodiversity can be a nature-based solution to some invasions, although it remains to be seen if climate change will alter these effects over longer timescales",,text,Biology,,e-Publications@Marquette

biotic resistance hypothesis,155233700,Data from: Mechanisms of biotic resistance across complex life cycles,10.5061/dryad.82j1g,"Rius, M.",,"1. Biotic resistance is the ability of communities to inhibit the establishment, spread or impact of novel species. However, the interactions that underlie biotic resistance depend heavily on the contexts in which species interact. Consequently, studies of biotic resistance that consider single processes, patches, species or life-history stages may provide an incomplete picture of the capacity for communities to resist invasion. 2. Many organisms have multiphasic life cycles, where individuals can occupy distinct niches at different stages of the life-history. Generally, studies of biotic resistance focus on interactions within a single life-history stage, and interactions at other life-history stages are overlooked. Here, we demonstrate that different mechanisms of biotic resistance occur across the life history and together limit the invasion success of an introduced marine invertebrate (Ciona intestinalis) in northern California. 3. We tested the role of interactions (competition and predation) with the resident community in limiting the abundance of Ciona through experiments conducted on fertilization, larval survival, settlement, early post-settlement survival, and the survival of juveniles and adults. 4. Under some circumstances, Ciona became abundant in mid-successional stages and showed more rapid growth rates than a morphologically similar native species, Ascidia ceratodes. However, predators reduced Ciona abundance much more than that of Ascidia at several life stages. 5. Furthermore, Ciona appeared to be a weaker competitor at the adult stage. Early life-history interactions with other sessile species at the fertilization, larval and recruit stages had modest to no effects on Ciona abundance. 6. The presence of biotic resistance mechanisms acting at multiple life stages, and potentially under different conditions, suggests that different components of biotic resistance interact to enhance the resident community's resistance to invasion",,info:eu-repo/semantics/dataset,,,Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS)

Many privileges we currently take for granted as rights, e.g., modern surgery, would not be possible without these drugs. But the rapid rise of antibiotic resistance may soon thrust the world back into this era. In order to predict (and ultimately prevent) the emergence of antibiotic resistance, it is crucial to establish quantitative, predictive links between the fitness of drug resistant organisms and the molecular mechanisms conferring resistance. Although the resistance mechanisms are often well characterized in vitro, their contributions to microbial fitness may depend critically on the environment and on the internal state of bacteria, which are often unknown in quantitative terms. To bridge this gap I investigate E. coli strains constitutively expressing resistance to translation-inhibiting antibiotics. The results show that in the presence of drugs, genes providing drug resistance are subject to an innate, positive feedback due to the global effect of drug- inhibited growth on gene expression. This feedback results in complex behaviors for isogenic populations of cells, including an abrupt drop in the growth rate of cultures at a threshold drug concentration. At drug concentrations below this threshold, cells exhibit growth bistability-- the coexistence of large populations of non-growing cells among otherwise identical, but growing, cells. This work demonstrates for the first time that many bacteria remain susceptible to an antibiotic even as they carry resistance to it. These behaviors do not appear in strains that lack drug resistance, and a quantitative characterization of drug-drug resistance interactions reveals a whole that is surprisingly richer than its parts. A mathematical model of bacterial growth based on the innate feedback predicts the onset of bistability and the growth rates of growing sub-populations, without invoking any ad hoc fitting parameters. Furthermore, the model describes a fitness landscape for bacterial drug resistance in different environments, allowing me to characterize the factors that determine the evolvability of resistance. The approach I use can be generalized to study resistance against other classes of antibiotics, besides the translation inhibitors studied her",,etd,"UCSD Dissertations, Academic Physics.

A crucial requirement for the development of successful resistance management strategies is a molecular understanding of the nature and inheritance of resistance mechanisms. This information can be used to design management strategies that will delay or counteract Bt resistance. The best known Bt resistance mechanism is inactivation of brush border membrane receptors. This type of resistance has a largely recessive mode of inheritance, which has enabled the design of resistance management approaches involving high dose and refuge strategies. Recent observations suggest that other resistance mechanisms are possible, including a mechanism that sequesters the toxin in the gut lumen through inducible immune reactions. The elevated immune status associated with tolerance to the toxin can be transmitted to subsequent generations by a maternal effect, which has implications for resistance management in the field. The high dose/refuge strategy may not be appropriate for the management of these alternative resistance mechanisms and other strategies have to be developed if inducible dominant resistance or tolerance mechanisms occur frequently in the field.Gang Ma; Muhammad Sarjan; Christopher Preston; Sassan Asgari; Otto Schmid",,Journal article,"Bacillus thuringiensis, crystal toxin, innate immunity, melanization, resistance mechanism",Insect Science,'Wiley'

biotic resistance hypothesis,346573212,"The prevalence, mechanism and evolution of agrochemical resistance in natural populations",,"Parts, L",2019,"Agrochemical resistance is a growing problem endangering global food security. The cumulative increase in the number of resistant species since the introduction of the first synthetic pesticides in the 1940s and the projected increase of the global population place more stringent requirements on the yields of agricultural food production. An increased amount of damage is predicted to result from resistance to currently used agrochemicals due to the dearth of new chemicals being developed. Despite this, resistance biology lacks methods to study the phenomenon as a whole, beyond the identification of resistance conferring mutations in particular pest or lab populations.  This thesis tests the utility of using the model organism C. elegans to study the prevalence of naturally occurring resistance alleles, the dynamics of resistance emergence in controlled conditions, and the genetic basis of resistance from multiple sources. Assessing the presence of natural variation in chemical susceptibility utilising a genetically diverse panel of C. elegans indicated that resistance-conferring variation is widespread, as suggested by the identification of wild isolates naturally resistant to carbendazim and aldicarb. The observation of rapid adaptation to carbendazim exposure suggested a link between a high prevalence of natural resistance with fast emergence of resistance for benzimidazoles, while compounds of other modes of action, with high and low variation, saw no adaptation in experimental populations under the conditions tested. Identification of the genetic basis of carbendazim-resistance in strains of three different biological origins linked a C. elegans β-tubulin to the trait in all cases, indicating a high level of convergence and lack of stochasticity in the evolution of benzimidazole resistance. Furthermore, no fitness cost of benzimidazole resistance in the compound-free environment was identified under laboratory conditions, which is troubling as the presence of a fitness cost underlies many resistance management strategies.    Overall, the findings presented in this thesis provide evidence that C. elegans is a useful model system to study resistance biology in a holistic manner, particularly in an evolutionary context. An increased understanding of the natural prevalence, evolutionary biology and molecular basis of the phenomenon would better inform field strategies of resistance mitigation as well as computational models that study the interplay of complex parameters in emergence of resistance. Ultimately, this improved understanding could assist in minimising the danger of rapidly emerging resistant pest populations on global food security.</p",,Thesis,,,

We developed a model of resistance transmission with human, animal, and environmental compartments. We compared the model outcomes under different transmission scenarios, conducted a sensitivity analysis, and investigated the impacts of curtailing antibiotic usage in animals. Human resistance levels were most sensitive to parameters associated with the human compartment (rate of loss of resistance from humans) and with the environmental compartment (rate of loss of environmental resistance and rate of environment-to-human transmission). Increasing environmental transmission could lead to increased or reduced impact of curtailing antibiotic consumption in animals on resistance in humans.

R., van Kleunen, Mark, Dullinger, Stefan, Essl, Franz, Dullinger, Iwona",2018,"1. Biotic resistance represents an important natural barrier to potential invaders throughout the world, yet the underlying mechanisms that drive such resistance are still debated. In theory, native communities should repel both functionally similar invaders which compete for the same resources, and invaders which possess less competitive traits. However, environmental stress, trade-offs across vital rates and competition-induced plastic trait shifts may modify expected competitive outcomes, thereby influencing invasion dynamics.2. In order to test these theoretical links between trait distributions and biotic resistance, we performed a mesocosm experiment with 25 non-native ornamental species invading native plant communities. Each non-native species was grown with and without the native community under two watering treatments (regular and reduced). We measured biotic resistance as the difference in performance of nonnative individuals grown with and without the community in terms of their survival, growth and reproduction. We quantified overall functional dissimilarity between non-native ornamental individuals and native communities based on the combination of plant height, specific leaf area and seed mass. Then, assuming each of these traits is also potentially linked to competitive ability, we measured the position of non-natives on trait hierarchies. While height is positively correlated with competitive ability for light interception, conservative leaf and seed characteristics provide greater tolerance to competition for other resources. Finally, we quantified plastic trait shifts of non-native individuals induced by competition.3. Indeed, the native community repelled functionally similar individuals by lowering the invader’s survival rate. Simultaneously, shorter ornamental individuals with larger specific leaf areas were less tolerant to biotic resistance from the community across vital rates, although the effect of trait hierarchies often depended on watering conditions. Finally, non-natives responded to competition by shifting their traits. Most importantly, individuals with more competitive traits were able to overcome biotic resistance also through competition-induced plastic trait shifts.4. Synthesis. Our results highlight that both functional dissimilarity and trait hierarchies mediate biotic resistance to ornamental plant invaders. Nevertheless, environmental stress as well as opposing trends across vital rates are also influential. Furthermore, plastic trait shifts can reinforce potential invaders’ competitive superiority, determining a positive feedback.publishe",,info:eu-repo/semantics/article,"competition, Darwin’s naturalization hypothesis, drought, fitness differences, intraspecific trait variability, invasion ecology, mesocosm experiment, niche differences, stress, vital rates, info:eu-repo/classification/ddc/570",,'Wiley'

Bacteria evolve resistance to antibiotics by a multitude of mechanisms. A central, yet unsolved question is how resistance evolution affects cell growth at different drug levels. Here, we develop a fitness model that predicts growth rates of common resistance mutants from their effects on cell metabolism. The model maps metabolic effects of resistance mutations in drug-free environments and under drug challenge; the resulting fitness trade-off defines a Pareto surface of resistance evolution. We predict evolutionary trajectories of growth rates and resistance levels, which characterize Pareto resistance mutations emerging at different drug dosages. We also predict the prevalent resistance mechanism depending on drug and nutrient levels: low-dosage drug defence is mounted by regulation, evolution of distinct metabolic sectors sets in at successive threshold dosages. Evolutionary resistance mechanisms include membrane permeability changes and drug target mutations. These predictions are confirmed by empirical growth inhibition curves and genomic data of Escherichia coli populations.

A mathematical model evaluating these complex relationships was developed in an individual colonized with strains of pan-susceptible, single-, two- and multidrug-resistant (MDR) gram-negative bacilli (GN). The effect of bacterial fitness, compensatory mutations and the frequency of three-antimicrobial regimen exposure to predominance of multidrug-resistant strains were quantified. The model predicts that initially, in the absence of antibiotic exposure, the biologically fitter pan-susceptible strain predominates over the resistant strains. Over time, the fitness of the MDR strains increases faster with repeated antimicrobial exposure, through compensatory-fitness mutations. Increasing the frequency of exposure to the three-antimicrobial regimen or, increasing the initial fitness of the resistant strains, substantially decreases the time to MDR-GN predominance. The model implies that when MDR-GN strains evolve into strains that are fitter than susceptible strains, a reduction in antimicrobial exposure may not result in a decrease of MDR-GN, since the absence of selective antimicrobial pressure would no longer favor susceptible strains.

Few studies have addressed the underlying processes by dissecting how biotic resistance to new invaders may be shaped by the same environmental influences that determine diversity and other community properties. In grasslands with heterogeneous soils, we added invaders and removed competitors to analyze the causes of invasion resistance. Abiotic resistance was measured using invader success in the absence of the resident community. Biotic resistance was measured as the reduction in invader success in the presence of the resident community. Invaders were most successful where biotic resistance was lowest and abiotic resistance was highest, confirming the dominant role of biotic resistance. Contrary to theory, though, biotic resistance was highest where both species richness and functional diversity were lowest. In the multivariate framework of a structural equation model, biotic resistance was independent of community diversity, and was highest where fertile soils led to high community biomass. Seed predation slightly augmented biotic resistance without qualitatively changing the results. Soil-related genotypic variation in the invader also did not affect the results. We conclude that in natural systems, diversity may be correlated with invasibility and yet have little effect on biotic resistance to invasion.

In this doctoral thesis I test hypotheses on biotic resistance using a large dataset of more than 1000 both failed and successful introductions of freshwater fish into Swedish lakes. We have found that the classic species richness hypothesis is a poor descriptor of introduction success because it fails to acknowledge that resident species contribute to the resistance in different ways. We developed a new measure of biotic resistance, the weighted species richness, which takes into account that the resident species contributes to the resistance with different strength and sign. Further, we correlated performance traits of species in their role as an invader and as a resident species to predict how the biotic resistance of these communities would develop over time. We found a positive correlation between performance traits: Some species have high introduction success, they make a large contribution to the resistance, and they cause extinctions when introduced but do not go extinct themselves when other species establishes, whereas other species are weak performers in these respects. Thus, the biotic resistance of these communities should grow stronger as non-native species accumulates. These results give us clues about what type of communities that should be most sensitive to further invasions, i.e., communities harboring species weak performers.  My results show that the biotic resistance of communities is an important factor in determining invasibility of a community. They also show that methods for quantifying resistance must take into account how interactions are structured in nature. What determine the biotic resistance of a community is the type of interactions that the resident species have with the invader and not the species richness of the community",,"Doctoral thesis, comprehensive summary, info:eu-repo/semantics/doctoralThesis, text","biotic resistance, freshwater fish, introductions, invasions, invasion success, invasibility, invasiveness, species richness, saturation, species identity, weighted species richness, Ecology, Ekologi",,Umeå : Umeå universitet

disturbance hypothesis,156684036,The intermediate disturbance hypothesis: Patch dynamics and mechanisms of species coexistence,,"Roxburgh, Stephen, Shea, Katriona, Wilson, J Bastow",2015,"The intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) has been used for several decades as an explanation for the coexistence of species in ecological communities. It is intuitively simple, but deceptively so. We show, via discussion and examples, that the IDH is not one mechanism of coexistence, but rather summarizes a set of similar phenomena that can arise from the action of several different coexistence mechanisms. These underlying mechanisms are defined by the various ways in which species differ in their response to disturbance-induced spatial and temporal variability in resources and environmental conditions. As an example, the original specification of the IDH required patchy disturbances for coexistence. However, because the underlying mechanisms of coexistence can also operate at the within-patch scale, patchy disturbances are not a necessary requirement for coexistence under intermediate-disturbance regimes. These conclusions are illustrated through the analysis of three models: a spatial within-patch model, a spatial between-patch model, and a purely temporal model. All three generate similar patterns of coexistence under intermediate disturbance, yet underlying that coexistence lie at least two quite-distinct mechanisms of species coexistence: the storage effect and relative nonlinearity. The results from our analyses suggest that, as a promoter of species coexistence, the IDH is both broader in scope and richer in detail than has previously been recognized",,Journal article,"Keywords: coexistence; community ecology; environmental factor; intermediate disturbance hypothesis; patch dynamics Coexistence, mechanisms of; Environmental variability; Intermediate disturbance hypothesis; Nonlinearity, relative; Patch dynamics; Reciprocal-yield law (RYL) model; Species coexistence, storage effect",issn:0012-9658,Ecological Society of America

Disturbance is often thought to favour invaders as it allows recruitment; however, the effects of disturbance are more complicated when it results in mortality of the invader. When disturbance rates in both invader occupied and unoccupied sites are the same, recruitment and mortality effects are exactly balanced, and successful invasion is independent of the disturbance regime. Differences in the disturbance rates between invader occupied and unoccupied sites can occur through invader modification or management of disturbance. Under these conditions, we found a novel mechanism for the generation of an Allee effect, which occurs when the invader promotes disturbance in sites it already occupies.

This is because the concepts are based on experience at particular levels of organization or on systems whose structure is well known. The definitions are thus inadequate for the development of a general theory of ecological disturbance. A universally applicable definition would 1) identify the object disturbed; 2) distinguish between change in the object that is disturbance versus change that is not; and 3) distinguish between direct and indirect consequences of disturbance. To meet these requirements, we formally link the hierarchical organization of ecological objects and the concept of disturbance. Any persistent ecological object will have a minimal structure, or system of lower level entities that permit its persistence. Disturbance is a change in the minimal structure of an object caused by a factor external to the level of interest. Using these definitions, disturbancean be unequivocally identified and associated with various specific ecological levels of organization. Because of the dependence of the concept of disturbance on recognizing the minimal structure of ecological systems, application of the concept will advance as refined models of the hierarchical structure of ecological systems are elaborate",,text,"Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Forest Biology",,Hosted by Utah State University Libraries

To test the validity of this concept for the species-poor marine hard-bottom community of the Western Baltic, we chose an in situ experimental approach. Undisturbed fouling communities of 2 different successional stages, 3 and 12 mo old, were submitted to various levels of emersion intensities, defined as time spans of continuous exposure to the air d-1. Disturbance levels ranged from 0.25 h up to 12 h of daily exposure. The study on 3 mo old communities was repeated in 2 subsequent years, 1999 and 2000. Species richness, evenness and diversity (Shannon index) were recorded to measure the effect of intensity treatments on community structure. The IDH was confirmed in the first year, when diversity was found to peak at intermediate disturbances. However, for communities of both successional stages, diversity-disturbance relationships were U-shaped or not significant in the second year. This ambiguous picture basically confirms the validity of the mechanisms proposed by the IDH, but shows that their forcing can be masked by fluctuations in environmental parameters, such as climatic conditions. An extension of the model is proposed, that considers diversity enhancement under extreme conditions due to a disturbance-induced change in community structure. Furthermore we discuss a conceptual linkage of the IDH to the multiple stable-state hypothesis.

disturbance hypothesis,160175023,A Study on State Dependent Disturbance Compensation Method for Motor System with Output Time Delay,,정대성,2014,"DoctorThis thesis suggests a state dependent disturbance compensation method for an output time delay existing motor system control. A name of the component which realizes the suggested compensation method is designated as a state dependent disturbance observer (SDDOB). Because the SDDOB uses conventional linear disturbance observer (DOB) scheme, it inherits the advantages of DOB including simple structure to add on the main controller, modeling error compensation property and powerful disturbance compensation ability. The SDDOB and a main PI controller constitute a robust controller in this thesis. The SDDOB can compensate current state dependent disturbance precisely although known output time delay which is frequently provoked in the practical implementation and internal time delay from Q-filter exist in an operating environment. Because the majority of state dependent disturbances of motor system is rotor angle dependent disturbances and to give illustrative explanation with theoretical analyses, this thesis demonstrates the method which only targets to reject the rotor angle dependent disturbances although the proposed method can handle other kinds of state dependent disturbances.  To validate the effectiveness of proposed compensation method theoretically, several lemmas and theorems that are related to the state dependent disturbance compensation ability and stability of suggested sub-controller are contained in this thesis. In addition, results of fulfilled computer simulations and experiments are included in this thesis also to confirm the properties of SDDOB. The computer simulations use an identical system model to the experimentsa direct-drive motor within a 0.25 [rad] tilted 1-degree-of-freedom (1-DOF) planar robot. The results of computer simulations and experiments show that the suggested method promptly compensates the current state dependent disturbance even if known output time delays were included in the control environment",,"Thesis, Thesis",,,포항공과대학교

Firstly, the mean square stability matrix is obtained from the stability theory of stochastic systems, and three stability indexes (root-mean-square resilience, root-mean-square reactivity and root-mean-square amplification envelope) of the ecosystem response to stochastic disturbances are calculated. We find that: (1) no matter which population is disturbed, increasing the intensity of disturbance improves the ability of the system leaves steady state and thus decreases the stability. The root-mean-square amplification envelope rises with increasing disturbance intensity, (2) the system is more sensitive to the disturbance of the predator than disturbance to prey, (3) ρmax and tmax are important indicators, which represent the intensity and time of maximum amplification by disturbance. These findings are helpful for managers to take corresponding management measures to reduce the disturbances, especially for predators, thereby avoiding the possible change of the structure and functions of the ecosystem",,article,"resilience, reactivity, amplification envelope, square root functional response, asymptotic and transient dynamics, Mathematics, QA1-939",Mathematics,MDPI AG
disturbance hypothesis,146915251,Disturbance monitoring in distributed power systems,,"Glickman, Mark",2007,"Power system generators are interconnected in a distributed network to allow sharing of power. If one of the generators cannot meet the power demand, spare power is diverted from neighbouring generators. However, this approach also allows for propagation of electric disturbances. An oscillation arising from a disturbance at a given generator site will affect the normal operation of neighbouring generators and might cause them to fail. Hours of production time will be lost in the time it takes to restart the power plant. If the disturbance is detected early, appropriate control measures can be applied to ensure system stability. The aim of this study is to improve existing algorithms that estimate the oscillation parameters from acquired generator data to detect potentially dangerous power system disturbances.    When disturbances occur in power systems (due to load changes or faults), damped oscillations (or &quotmodes"""") are created. Modes which are heavily damped die out quickly and pose no threat to system stability. Lightly damped modes, by contrast, die out slowly and are more problematic. Of more concern still are &quotnegatively damped"""" modes which grow exponentially with time and can ultimately cause the power system to fail. Widespread blackouts are then possible. To avert power system failures it is necessary to monitor the damping of the oscillating modes. This thesis proposes a number of damping estimation algorithms for this task. If the damping is found to be very small or even negative, then additional damping needs to be introduced via appropriate control strategies.    This thesis presents a number of new algorithms for estimating the damping of modal oscillations in power systems. The first of these algorithms uses multiple orthogonal sliding windows along with least-squares techniques to estimate the modal damping. This algorithm produces results which are superior to those of earlier sliding window algorithms (that use only one pair of sliding windows to estimate the damping). The second algorithm uses a different modification of the standard sliding window damping estimation algorithm - the algorithm exploits the fact that the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) within the Fourier transform of practical power system signals is typically constant across a wide frequency range. Accordingly, damping estimates are obtained at a range of frequencies and then averaged. The third algorithm applied to power system analysis is based on optimal estimation theory. It is computationally efficient and gives optimal accuracy, at least for modes which are well separated in frequency",,Thesis,"distributed power system, power system disturbance, power system oscillation, white noise, coloured noise, damping factor, mean-square error, Cramer-Rao bound, orthogonal windows, least-squares techniques, spectral averaging, optimal estimation theory, Prony analysis",,Queensland University of Technology

The model under consideration is proposed to be a delayed differential equation (DDE) with multiplicative white noise perturbation. The method of the center manifold is generalized to reduce a delayed differential equation to a two-dimensional ordinary differential equation, to study delay-induced instability or Hopf bifurcation. Then, the stochastic average method is employed to obtain the Itô equation. Thus, the top Lyapunov exponent is calculated and  the necessary and sufficient condition of the asymptotic stability in views of probability one is obtained. The results show that the exponent is related to not only the strength of noise but also the delay, namely, the reaction speed of brain. The effect of the strength of noise on the human quiet standing losing stability is weak for a small delay. With the delay increasing, such effect becomes stronger and stronger. A small change in the strength of noise may destabilize the quiet standing for a large delay. It implies that a person with slow reaction is easy to lose the stability of his/her quiet standing",,article,"Engineering (General).

An analytical expression for the stationary probability density is derived in terms of a Gaussian distribution.

Strikingly, in the parameter regime close to the parameter regime in which the deterministic system exhibits Hopf bifurcations, we find that the variance as a function of the time delay exhibits a sequence of pronounced peaks. These peaks are interpreted as delay-induced destabilization resonances arising from oscillatory ghost instabilities.

The debate is on the relative merits of density-dependent and density-independent effects. One paradigm (revived by the research on global warming and its relation to long-term population data) states that fluctuations in population densities can often be accounted for by external noise. Several empirical models have been suggested to support this view Mt followed this by assuming a given population skeleton dynamics (Ricker dynamics and second-order autoregressive dynamics) topped off with noise composed of low- and high-frequency components. Our aim was to determine to what extent the modulated population dynamics correlate with the noise signal. High correlations (with time-lag -1) were observed with both model categories in the region of stable dynamics, but not in the region of periodic or complex dynamics. This finding is not very sensitive to low-frequency noise. High correlations throughout the entire range of dynamics are only achievable when the impact of the noise is very high. Fitted parameter values of skeleton dynamics modulated with noise are prone to err substantially. This casts doubt as to what degree the underlying dynamics are any more recognizable after being modulated hv the external noise",,"contributiontojournal/article, info:eu-repo/semantics/article, text",Biological Sciences,,'The Royal Society'

In order to test the hypothesis that disturbance is the primary direct factor driving the collapse of interactions occurring along environmental severity gradients, we conducted a removal experiment in the highly stressed French coastal dunes along a gradient of disturbance due to sand burial. Four dune species were used as targets and transplanted with and without neighbours in four communities along the gradient. The experiment was conducted twice, a dry and an average year. Results of the experiment showed that during the dry year the effect of the environment was prominent and only one species was facilitated for survival in the least disturbed community. During the average year, interactions for growth were important only in the same community, with positive or negative responses depending on the natural position of the target species within the coastal dune gradient. In accordance with our hypothesis, most interactions for both survival and growth were observed in the least disturbed community exhibiting the highest diversity.

However, our understanding of ecosystem responses to disturbances is still incomplete. Specifically, there is a mismatch between the diversity of disturbance regimes experienced by ecosystems and the one-dimensional description of disturbances used in most studies on ecological stability. To fill this gap, we conducted a full factorial experiment on microbial communities, where we varied the frequency and intensity of disturbances affecting species mortality, resulting in 20 different disturbance regimes. We explored the direct and long-term effects of these disturbance regimes on community biomass. While most communities were able to recover biomass and composition states similar to undisturbed controls after a halt of the disturbances, we identified some disturbance thresholds that had long-lasting legacies on communities.

It is assumed that the accident may have accelerated the slowdown of the Gulf Stream and changed its path, which led to a change in temperature, salinity and density of significant ocean masses. Variations of ocean mass density in some areas could cause a shift of the Earth’s center of mass by 10–5 m and a deviation of its rotation axis by 2.9∙10–6 arcsec. It is shown that the process of disturbance of the Earth’s dynamic balance can be accompanied by an increase in the number of relatively weak earthquakes (in a range of magnitudes 4.2–4.8 by 41.5%) and the intensity of seismic noise (tremor), as shown by broadband seismic networks and satellite GPS navigation data",,Text,,,EDP Sciences

Five disturbance treatments were used, differing in the frequency of applied disturbance events; the highest frequency treatments were dug every week, lowest every eight weeks. The experiment was run for a total of 25 weeks over the winter of 1997/98. Our experiment controlled for differences in recovery time after disturbances. Abundances of Pygospio elegans, Macoma balthica, Hydrobia ulvae and Streblospio benedicti were all significantly reduced in high disturbance treatments, as was the total number of species. No species showed significant increases in abundance in disturbed treatments,and there was no evidence of an increase in diversity in any treatments. These results are discussed in the context of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis.

Control problems arise in the plant mustbe solved in the plant. Until plant engineers and controldesigners are able to communicate with each other, their mut-ual problems await solution.” [1]The questions remain: (1) is there an advance control conceptthat worth sharing? (2) If so, how can it be communicated to “thepeople who must apply them”?Our thesis is therefore quite straightforward: the mutual problemof plant engineers and control designers, which has awaited solution,is the problem of disturbance and it should be the focus of the studyin automatic control, the foundation of which begins with the verynotion of disturbance, to which we now turn.2. The evolving notion of disturbanceLike any branch of science, the current generation of researchersin automatic control inherited a particular point of view, an implicitparadigm and an assumed value judgment from the previousgenerations, the protégés of which continue to shape this disciplinefrom their positions in academia. In the true spirit of science, allpoints of view, including and especially, the ones that have beendominant, must be continuously reﬂected upon and judged forrelevance and validity. All theories must be scrutinized and veriﬁedin practice; cherry picking of evidence to support a particular view,while unavoidable, must be discouraged. “We must be mindful offoundation”, as Prof. Astrom recently advised, or “the building mightfall” [2]. Our understanding must be absolutely clear concerningthe basic concepts, such as the meaning of disturbance or rejection,before a solid foundation of automatic control is built.Speciﬁcally, disturbance rejection is a ubiquitous term usedin control theory and it is one of the many design considerations intextbook techniques from loop-shaping to H1. It has essentiallybecome an academic jargon and is used freely without a secondthought. In reality, the word “disturbance” takes on differentmeanings as it is used in various contexts, often unknowingly. Itoften refers to a disruption coming from an external force, as, forexample, wind gust acting on an airplane; in some other cases,however, it may not be entirely clear whether the disruption iscoming from within or without. People seldom, if ever, ask “whatdo you mean by disturbance?” or “in what sense a disturbance issaid to be rejected?”Going back to the Oxford Dictionary of English again, the word“disturb” means “interfere with the normal arrangement or function-ing of”, fromwhich “disturbance” is inferred to as something abnormal,not part of the original plan, but tends to disrupt it. It is usedsynonymously with uncertainty an automatic control system isdesigned to deal with. “If there is no uncertainty in the system, thecontrol, or the environment, feedback control is largely unnecessary”[3], said renowned control theorist R. Brockett. If one is only concernedwith the type of the uncertainties that tend to “interfere with thenormal arrangement or functioning of”, then the problem of uncer-tainty is no different from the problem of disturbance and will bedenoted so in this paper for the sake of simplicity and clarity.As in any human endeavor, a lot of what is being done stemsfrom habits, consciously or otherwise. It is a habit that the problemassociated with the uncertainties internal (external) to a physicalsystem is denoted as the robustness (disturbance) problem. Infact, such robustness problem has become a dominant theme inmodern control theory and the topic of endless books and papers;the disturbance problem, on the other hand, is narrowly deﬁnedand is treated without much fanfare. The real world, however,does not draw a line to separate internal uncertainty from theexternal one. In a robot manipulator, for example, what would onecall the problem caused by the coupling among various joints?To each joint the disturbance coming from other joints areexternal but to the robot as a whole all joints are internal.Treating the coupling among joints in a robot manipulatoras robustness problem presupposes the detailed mathematicalmodel of it, which could be quite nonlinear and complex. Thispractical hindrance led researchers to a shortcut: to each joint, thecoupling force from other joints can be estimated in real time andcanceled, resulting in a much simpler and more effective solutioncalled disturbance observer (DOB) [4]. But by habit, the notion ofdisturbance used in the framework of DOB distinctly refers tosomething external, even though the solution equally applies todisturbances that are state dependent, thus creating an awkward-ness in articulating exactly what kind of uncertainties with whichthe method deals.This conceptual ambiguity was resolved once for all by Han inhis landmark paper of 1989, which for the ﬁrst time put forwardthe idea that, for the purpose of controlling a physical process,linear or nonlinear, having a complete mathematical model isboth impractical and unnecessary [5]. Physical system, Hanbelieves, can be controlled without a mathematical model becausethe information it needs can be extracted from the input–outputinformation. Hanwent on to open a new front of automatic controland spent the next two decades cultivating it [6–8]. This new areaof research is known as active disturbance rejection control(ADRC), with the “disturbance” referring to both internal (statedependent) and external forces that are unknown.The work of Han demonstrates that many boundaries in controltheory are artiﬁcial, reﬂecting not the nature of automatic controlbut our limitations in comprehending it. Such boundaries includethose that divide the systems as linear and nonlinear controls,internal dynamic uncertainty and external disturbance, timevarying and time invariance, etc. In fact, all these problems canbe seen as one and the same: the problem of disturbance, if theword “disturbance” is allowed to take on the more general mean-ing described above. Perhaps the most unique contribution fromHan's work is his notion of disturbance, which includes uncertain-ties both internal and external to the physical process[6–8]. A more detailed account will be given later in this paper.Taking it one step further, the term disturbance can now beused to denote the difference between what the system is andwhat it is should be, whether this difference belongs to theinternal or external uncertainties. But “what it should be” seemsproblem dependent, vague and ﬂeeting; it seems tied to theparticular system of interests, not easily describable as a universalconcept.With a penetrating insight, Han gave answer to this puzzlein 1979 by showing that under reasonable conditions, all linearand nonlinear systems can be reduced to the cascade integral formthat he termed “canonical form of feedback systems” [9], which isdenoted in this paper, for the sake of convenience, as Form Han(FH). In other words, most systems, linear or nonlinear, with statefeedback, can be transformed into FH, based on which controldesign can be standardized. Therefore, FH becomes the point ofdeparture for all design methods because various types of physicalsystems, once they are reduced to FH, are identical dynamicallyand can be controlled by a standard, ﬁxed controller.Note that FH anticipates much of the later, more complete, workon generalized control canonical form for linear and nonlinearsystems by M. Fliess and others. See [22] for details and referencestherein. In particular, Han discussed in [9] the problem of transform-ing a general nonlinear system to the control canonical form by theuse of input-dependent state transformation, to which Fliess gave arather expanded account a decade later [22].Han also gives us an alternative answer to the above questionof “what an ideal plant should be”. Using FH as the ideal plant,controllers are readily designed to meet the design speciﬁcations.To Han, the problem of automatic control comes down to theproblem of what to do with such disturbance, to which weturn next.3. Disturbance attenuation vs. disturbance rejection: aconceptual divideTo grasp for universal principles with explanation power is a partof human nature. The task has puzzled the mankind from thebeginning of civilization, in the quest to transcend the particulars,and it is especially challenging for engineers, who tend to focus onhow things are done and not to dwell on what to be done and why.The terms feedback and feedforward, for example, are solutions butthe problems they solve are seldom explained clearly. What doesfeedback do exactly? Prof. Wiener called it “a method of controllinga system by reinserting into it the results of its past performance”[10]. But why? What is the aim and how is it helpful in making thesystem remember what it has done in the past? Similarly, in theliterature we see terms like “two-degree-of-freedom” (2DOF) or“combined system”, begging the questions of “the freedom to dowhat?” and “what is combined and why?”There is a profound reason for such difﬁculty. In modern times,the presentation of an idea becomes increasingly more important,to the point of “presentation is everything”. In the ﬁeld ofautomatic control, engineering insights were gradually replacedin scholarly transactions by elegant but sometimes empty math-ematical symbols and academic jargons. “Everywhere that whichis apparent on the surface is reprinted, but nowhere (with veryfew exceptions) does the investigation go below the surface”, saidProf. Trinks in 1919 [11]. How much progress has been made sincethen is an open question.In this section, we strive to continue what Prof. Trinks startedin his “book of essentials and principles”: to make clear thefundamental concepts and principles of automatic control. MartinLuther King dreamed that a person is judged not on the color of hisskin but on the contents of his character. Likewise, we dream thatin the ﬁeld of automatic control, a scholar and her scholarly workare judged on the contents of her ideas, whoever and whereverthe person is.3.1. The notion of disturbance rejectionThe term “disturbance rejection” used in the context of classicaland modern control theory refers to how the external disturbanceis attenuated as it is propagated through the process, eventuallyaffecting the output. It is measured as the magnitude of thefrequency response that deﬁnes the disturbance–output relation-ship. It is speciﬁed, usually, in terms of the amount of attenuationand the corresponding frequency range required. Used in such amanner, “rejection” is synonymous to attenuation, or mitigation,or compensation. Shaping system response, in frequency domain,to external disturbances is what it really means by “disturbancerejection” in the current textbooks on control, unfortunately.The word “reject” comes from Latin, meaning “throw back”,and it has a derivative, rejector, to which we will come back.The word “reject” projects a sense of totality and ﬁnality, regardingthe object of concern. Putting the two words together “disturbancerejection” should, and therefore does from now on, mean literally “no”interruptions, whatsoever, of “a peaceful and settled condition”. If, asdiscussed above, the problem of automatic control is the problemof disturbance, then disturbance rejection is absolutely central.To be clear, in an ideal control system, the disturbance, the sumtotal of the internal dynamics and the external forces, should haveabsolutely no effect on the operation of the system as designed!Idealization is a powerful tool in science that helps us distilledpure concepts from messy details of everyday world, as shownin Newtonian physics (the ﬁrst law of motion) and Einstein'stheory of relativity (a human traveling at the speed of light).Likewise, the concept of disturbance rejection, as deﬁned above,helps us escape the drudgery of academic jargons and engineeringidiosyncrasies, to arrive at a universal goal, common to allengineered systems. And, as a side note not to be pursued further,it would not be difﬁcult to see how important disturbancerejection, as redeﬁned, is to us human beings in the happinessand peacefulness of our lives.The renewed conception of disturbance rejection will help usreestablish the “essentials and principles”, as shown below.3.2. The principle of ﬂyball governor and disturbance attenuationIdealization and FH allow us to grasp the principle behindthe ﬂyball governor as follows. Let u be the input (driving force),y the output (engine speed), and r the reference (desired speed).In the engine speed control system with the ﬂyball governor, thesteam ﬂow that provides the driving force to rotate the engineshaft is made proportional to the tracking error deﬁned as e¼ry.That is, the FH of steam engine isJ _y¼ u ð1Þwhere J is the inertia and the ﬂyball governor is described asu¼ kpe ð2Þwhere kp is the gain of the governor. The idea behind (2) is that if yis to be governed to follow a given value r, then its derivativeneeds to be made proportional to the tracking error e¼ry. Andthis is denoted as the principle of ﬂyball governor (PFG), which iswhat behind the invention but has not been articulated as suchuntil now.From the PFG as deﬁned, it can be seen why people had a hardtime swallowing it. “The principle in question has been pro-nounced defective and faulty, because, to cause the governor toact, it necessitates a change in the quantity to be kept constant”,Trinks wrote in 1919 [11], in the ﬁrst comprehensive book on thegovernors and the principles of governing in the English literature.In other words, substantial tracking error must exist, no matterwhat caused it, before the governor can act on it for the purpose ofreducing it to zero. But there is always a cause–effect relationshipbehind the tracking error; the PFG basically ignores the cause butacts on the effect. It is for this reasonwe denote the PFG also as theprinciple of disturbance attenuation (PDA) and its explanationpowers go far beyond the steam engine. In fact, much of whathas been in the realm of existing control theory can be seen asrooted in PDA. It is ubiquitous but unstated in all aspects ofautomatic control, theory and practice.Described more generally, there is ﬁrst a causal relationshipbetween the control variable (input or cause) and the controlledvariable (output or effect); second, there is a desired value for theoutput (setpoint); third, there is an unaccounted force (distur-bance) that tends to drive the output away from its desired value;ﬁnally the control variable is made a function of the differencebetween the output and its desired value, thus closing the loop.That is, the control action is driven by the difference between thecontrolled variable, i.e. the output, and its desired value for thepurpose of attenuating the effect of the disturbance.“Faulty” as it appears to be, the PFG, or PDA, survived. It indicatesa foundational characteristic an automatic control system possesses:the ability to adjust, by itself, in response to disturbances and toreturn to the “settled condition” of its original design. This act of“governing” gives the mechanism the name “governor”, from whichthe name “cybernetics” is derived. In other words, cyberneticsymbolizes a principle of governing that can be described as PDA; itis a goal for which feedback is the means.To rest the entire control theory on the notion of feedback,unfortunately, is to mistake the goal for the means. The mistake isthe result of the obsession with the “how” at the cost of ignoringthe “what” and the “why”. Feedback control is how we accom-plished disturbance attenuation; it is not the goal in itself. Aparticular governor is designed to govern and is but one embodi-ment of governing. But to mistake governing itself as a particulargovernor, no matter how great it is, is unfortunate. Sadly that isexactly what happened, as the well-respected historian, Otto Mayr,testiﬁes that “this ﬁeld [of automatic control] is essentially basedupon a single idea, that of feedback loop” [12]. In other words,the problem of automatic control has been mistaken as that offeedback loop.3.3. The principle of isochronous governor and disturbance rejectionIn the idealize form, the ﬂyball governor of (1) and (2) wouldnever oscillate. But in reality it does, because, as Poncelet [13]points out, there are two sets of motions involved: the motion ofsteam engine, i.e. the plant, and the motion of the ﬂyball, i.e. thecontroller. Clerk Maxwell set mathematical control theory on itspath of development by describing the control system with adifferential equation and determining the condition of oscillationfrom its characteristic polynomial. Routh continued this line ofinvestigation [14] but came to an erroneous conclusion that thecause of the oscillation is that the governor acts too fast, notrealizing it is the lag in the action of the governor that causes theoscillation, as pointed out by Poncelet.To solve the oscillation problem Poncelet proposed the Iso-chronous Governor, one that does not have any lag, ideally, in action.Linearizing the steam engine at a particular operating point, asimpliﬁed equation isJ _y¼ ayþdþu ð3Þwith a as the friction coefﬁcient and d is the external disturbance.The sudden appearance of the disturbance force, d, tends tojolt the engine out of its equilibrium. Poncelet sketched a diagramof a different type of governor, namely the Isochronous Governor,that measures d and cancels its effect on the engine with aninstantaneous opposing action of steam valve. This is denoted asPoncelet's principle in [11]. A more descriptive deﬁnition adoptedhere is principle of disturbance rejection (PDR), which is the oppositeof PDA.If PDA signiﬁes an acceptance, an admission, however reluc-tant, that the operation of the process will be interrupted orinterfered with by disturbance, the principle of disturbance rejec-tion (PDR) is exactly the opposite. True to the root meaning of theword “reject”, PDR signiﬁes the idea that the causes of the outputdeviation, i.e. disturbance, can be determined and “thrown back”,i.e. canceled. Furthermore, once this cause is removed, the outputdeviation can be, to a large extent, avoided. And this is the maindifference between PDA and PDR.Perhaps the earliest example of PDR is the South-PointingChariot (SPC) that, by legend, goes all the way back to the YellowEmperor of the third millennium BC, the ancestor of all Chinese[15]. This apparatus has a ﬁgure mounted on top of a chariot witha ﬁnger always pointing to the south, no matter how the chariotmoves and turns. It is made possible by an ingenious gear systemthat measures the rotation of the chariot, from the difference inrotation between the wheels on either side, and counter rotatesthe pointing ﬁgure by the same amount.Note that in this governor, the output is not measured, thedisturbance (rotation of the chariot) is. That is, there is no outputfeedback, as is deﬁned in feedback control texts. In this sense,Poncelet's Isochronous Governor is quite similar to SPC, as thesteam valve is immediately adjusted by the detection of the loadchange. More than a century later, Poncelet's idea was revived andformalized as invariance principle (IP) by Shipanov from the thenSoviet Union in the form of a set of mathematical conditions underwhich the output of a process is made “invariant” in the presenceof an external disturbance [16]; it led to the two-channel principle[17] where the disturbance is measured and fed to controller forthe purpose of achieving the “absolute invariance”, i.e. the idealdisturbance rejection.Clearly evident in Poncelet and Shipanov's work is the recogni-tion that the problem of control is that of disturbance rejection,despite the various limitations in their solutions. This point viewgreatly inﬂuenced a Chinese graduate student who studied inMoscow in 1960s and later made the next breakthrough in the1990s, continuing the progress of this idea that simply refuses togo away [5–8,18,19].Han deﬁnes disturbance in a more general sense, to includeuncertainties both internal and external. To reject such distur-bances, according to Han, requires that their impact on the processbe equivalent to an uncertainty in the input channel, which can betreated as an extended state, estimated via a state observer, andcanceled by the control action. This new framework of a general-ized notion of disturbance, its estimation and cancellation, and thecontrol of the remaining plant by various means were system-atically and meticulously developed by Han over a period of twodecades, leading to what is known as active disturbance rejectioncontrol (ADRC).Speciﬁcally, by including dynamic uncertainties as a part ofdisturbance internal to the process, a much broader framework isestablished that could unite the previously separated subjectsin control theory: robustness, adaptive control, and disturbancerejection in the narrow sense, etc., reducing the basic problems ofautomatic control to disturbance rejection. In doing so, theprevious principles of Poncelet and Shipanov are made applicableto those processes where the model is mostly unknown and thedisturbance is now estimated, not measured, making it a muchmore practical solution.4. Disturbance rejector and disturbance rejection controlClose to 200 years had passed from Watt's invention of ﬂyballgovernor to Wiener's articulation of feedback as the underlyingconcept with enormous explanation power. Consequently, theprevious terminologies used by different groups of practitionersfrom different places at different times were uniﬁed under a singleconcept, the concept of feedback. Correspondingly, the term “con-troller”, if not otherwise qualiﬁed, has become synonymous withthe feedback control mechanism.Likewise, from Yellow Emperor's SPC, to Poncelet's IsochronousGovernor, to Shipanov's invariance principle, and ﬁnally to Han'sADRC, these ingenious human inventions share the distinct, if other-wise unstated, trait of disturbance rejection not found in feedbackcontrol and they also share the unique machinery of a disturbancerejector, in parallel to the controller. Speciﬁcally, “disturbance rejector”,or simply “rejector”, is deﬁned here as a mechanism that obtains thedisturbance information and cancels it out with the control action.Furthermore, the combined controller–rejector pair forms the basicstructure of disturbance rejection control (DRC), as shown, for example,in Fig. 1.The basic idea of DRC is to not let the controller interfacedirectly with the messy physical processes, full of nonlinearities,uncertainties, and other nastiness. Instead, the controller regulatesthe enforced plant, i.e. the transformed plant where the nastinesshas been taken out, more or less, by the rejector. The controller'stask of meeting the design speciﬁcations becomes a lot easierwhen it deals with the enforced plant, which tends to be muchsimpler and less uncertain than the actual process. And this is theidea that has been missing in the controller-only paradigm ofmodern control.Whether it is robust control or adaptive control, or even thefeedback control itself, the goal has always been to deal with unce-rtainties, and at the same time, meet the performance speciﬁcations.But making a single controller do both proves to be unnecessarilycomplex or even intractable at times, to which DRC provides agenuine alternative.4.1. Disturbance rejector, the enforced plant and the renewed notionof modelThe rejector, as deﬁned above and shown in Fig. 1, performstwo key tasks: (1) collecting, processing and communicating thedisturbance and state information; (2) canceling, or eradiating,the disturbance. Within the framework of DRC, the taskof automatic control is shared between the controller and therejector: the rejector rejects and the controller controls. That is,the rejector performs the main task of rejecting disturbance andcontroller forces the output to follow the command.The enforced plant represents the dynamics of the process afterthe disturbance is removed. With the expanded deﬁnition ofdisturbance, even the very notion of the model is redeﬁned.To put it in another way, it is not that DRC is now “model-free”,because no matter how simple it is, there is always a model thatpictures the plant to be controlled, based on which a controller isdesigned; but rather, the very concept of model is renewed.In the traditional concept of mathematical model, patterningafter the natural sciences, the dynamics of a physical system isdescribed as closely as possible by a set of mathematical equations,known as the model. And this set of equations is the starting pointof all analyses and designs. A fundamental, if implicit, premise ofthe entire modern control theory is that the model is given, moreor less. And it is in this sense modern control theory can be seen asthe “doctrine of model"""" suggested by Han [5].In DRC, the demarcation is broken down between what is knownas “internal” dynamics and “external” disturbance. The enforced plantrepresents the dynamics of the system to be controlled; it could be themathematical model of the physical process in its traditional sense, orit could be chosen in the form of FH, or somewhere in between. In anycase, the rejector treats all that is different from the enforced plant as“disturbance” to be rejected. Taking it this way, control design is neverentirely “model-free” or model-independent, even in the case whenthe enforced plant is chosen in the ideal form of FH. Instead, thecontroller is designed for the enforced plant, the ﬁdelity of which inrelation to process dynamics determines the amount of disturbancethe rejector has to contend with. It is in this sense the task ofautomatic control is shared between the controller and the rejector.In modern control, the task is entirely shouldered by thecontroller, in the absence of the rejector and with the premisethat a high ﬁdelity model of the actual process is given. In the caseof ADRC proposed by Han, the complexity of the controller isminimized as all dynamics aside from FH is deemed as disturbanceand rejected, which makes the quality of control system as good asthat of the rejector. The balance between the controller and therejector in practice will fall in the wide range between these two.The better the disturbance estimator, the less the knowledge of theplant dynamics is needed.4.2. Various means of obtaining the disturbance informationThe notion of rejector can perhaps help reorient the previouslynot well organized set of tools in a not well-deﬁned ﬁeld ofresearch. Because of the lack of recognition of the underlyinguniversal principle, even though various forms of disturbanceestimation and rejection have been proposed in the solutions ofvarious problems, the researchers are mostly unaware of the ﬁeldas a whole and each other's work in particular. In early 1970s,the unknown input observer (UIO) was proposed to obtain thedisturbance information with a state observer, assuming that themodel of both the plant and the disturbance was given; in thelate 1980s, another method, the disturbance observer (DOB), wasproposed for robotic manipulators where the disturbance iscalculated by sending the output of the plant to its inverse transferfunction and subtracting the result from the input. DOB was laterbrought into state space to deal with nonlinear system and theequivalency between UIO and DOB was established for lineartime invariant system with external disturbance. In the 1990s,the Extended State Observer (ESO) was proposed speciﬁcally toestimate and cancel “total disturbance” in the context of ADRC.A survey of these and other types of state and disturbanceobservers can be found in [20] and some recent work on DOBbased design in the context of robust control can be found, forexample, in [21].In addition, the recent work of Fliess and Join on “model-freecontrol” shows yet another instance of disturbance rejector atwork [23], albeit anonymously, the uniqueness of which resides inthe real time estimation of disturbances using the algebraicidentiﬁcation method and the proposition that most, if not all,physical systems can be treated as ﬁrst- or second-order system[24]. Another form of rejector is the embedded model controlapproach proposed by Canuto [25] where the uncertainty isestimated online and canceled with control action. These are buta few examples, all of which can be well explained by the conceptof total disturbance and the structure of DRC, shown in Fig. 1,and understood as a design philosophy of actively estimating andcanceling the total disturbance, regardless of the means. In doingso, all methods discussed above share a common objective, under-standing, and structure; the only difference is in how the dis-turbance is estimated and in the premises made.4.3. Disturbance-free control and a paradigm shiftThe unifying concept of disturbance rejector, together with thestructure of DRC, marks both a paradigm shift in how controlleris designed and a conceptual turning point in how disturbance isdealt with. The schematics of control system took a drasticallydifferent form, as shown in Fig. 1. Note that although the internaland external disturbances are very different in nature and theyenter into the process throughout its physical layout, they arenonetheless lumped into the “total disturbance” that affects theFig. 1. Disturbance rejection control.process in the same channel where the process input is, and thereis a deep insight behind.Speciﬁcally, all disturbances that could cause the output tochange is, in a sense, observable; furthermore, since the processinput by design is to cause the output to change, the output changedue to any disturbances, no matter what the actual disturbance is,can be seen as the result of input abnormality; ﬁnally the processinput, in turn, can be manipulated to cancel this abnormality and toreturn the process dynamics to that of the ideal, disturbance-free,form. It is for this reason that the DRC perhaps can be betterunderstood as disturbance-free control (DFC).This kind of disturbance rejection is deemed active because itdoesn't wait for the disturbance to work its way through thephysical process and cause signiﬁcant changes in the stateand output. The Total Disturbance Estimator in Fig. 1 denotes themachinery for this purpose and it can take on various forms andnames, as discussed above. Regardless of the particular mechan-ism employed to estimate the disturbance, the role of the Rejectorcancels it by subtracting its estimate from the process input. Most,if not all, mechanisms of disturbance rejection described earliercan be reduced to the structure of DRC in Fig. 1, in which theelusive universal principle, the principle of disturbance rejection,is on vivid display.To describe it yet in another way, Han deﬁnes that themathematical model of all feedback systems to be controlled asthat of FH, i.e. in the cascade integral form, on which the controllercan be designed using any existing method. The job of disturbancerejector is to enforce this model by estimating and canceling allthe discrepancies in the physical system. In this framework, thedifﬁcult and complex control problems, such as those associatedwith nonlinear, uncertain, time-varying process of multi-input andmulti-output with strong couplings among variables, becomeeasily solvable after the rejector has done its work. In this sense,the rejector is also an enforcer, enforcing the plant to behave likeFH and inducing a completely different mindset on how controlsystem is designed.This disturbance-centric paradigm shift in control designsymbolizes a drastic departure from the so called modern controltheory. To be speciﬁc, it calls into question the very basic premise:what needs to be understood, at the minimum, regarding thephysical process to be controlled. To assume complete knowledge ofit, more or less, is to assume the problem away, more or less. Itmerely shifts the burden from control to system identiﬁcation,often at a signiﬁcant cost. But the history shows that the tempta-tion of mathematization of automatic control is too strong toresist: the problem of control design can be turned into a problem ofmathematical deduction if both the measure of optimality and thephysical process can be reduced to a set of precise mathematicalequations. In reality, however, neither is the case; to insist other-wise, to continue to ignore the facts in control practice, is merelydelusional.The practice of control engineering, just like any other humanactivities, is full of trade-offs, which are hard to put in precisemathematical terms. The beneﬁts are always weighed against thecosts, manifested in various forms. All practitioners are concernedwith cost and, by extension, the economy of model: high ﬁdelitycomes with a high cost and it must be justiﬁed by the beneﬁtsgained. For example, the use of model predictive control, withcostly models, can be justiﬁed in certain applications in processindustry, even though it is still dominated by PID as a whole.Arguably, the prevalence of PID in all industry sectors speaksa single truth: the cost of model-centric design, as suggested bymodern control theory, does not justify its costs in general. By thesame token, high gain designs, as advocated by some preeminentscholars, often ignored the associated high cost. This failure inrecognizing the cost–beneﬁt relationship is at the bottom of theexisting theory–practice divide that is still poorly understood, itappears. On the other hand, the reality of control design with lowﬁdelity models, or with no models at all as some claimed,necessarily shift our attention in control engineering back to theproblem of total disturbance. This is at the core of the “paradigmshift” in control science: shifting from model-centric to disturbance-centric in framework and in mindset. The result could be profound,as further explained next.4.4. A Copernican momentThe controller–rejector tandem, shown in Fig. 1, provides a rareCopernican moment where our fundamental conception of auto-matic control is transformed. Ever since the inception of moderncontrol in the middle of the last century, the mathematical modelof the physical process is presumed given and is the point ofdeparture for analysis and synthesis. Unlike the ﬁlter design,control design is generally not reusable and is thus performedfor each problem, under each set of speciﬁcations. Everythingrevolves around the mathematical model that supposedly capturesthe plant dynamics globally. But is this absolutely necessary?Is this an overkill that puts unnecessary burden on the part ofmodeling? Is it realistic to assume complete knowledge of thephysical process globally? There were the questions Han contem-plated over two decades ago and his answer was a resounding no[5]! Interestingly, Fliess and his collaborators [23] later came to thesimilar conclusions, symbolized by their ultra-local model ofdynamic systems. The remarkable parallel between Han's earliervision and Fliess's later work is striking, even though they wereseparated geographically, culturally, and in time.This Copernican moment, this completely different orientationof the minds, is on vivid display in Fig. 1, where the controllerneeds to be designed only once and where the rejector forces thephysical process of all kinds, linear or nonlinear, time varying ortime invariant, deterministic or stochastic, etc. to behave like thepredetermined enforced plant based on which the controller isdesigned. When the enforced plant is chosen to be in the form ofFH, for example, the rejector treats all departures from FH asdisturbances and cancels it with the control action. Instead ofvarious controller designs revolving around the mathematicalmodel of the plant, this time, in this framework of the control-ler–rejector tandem, the plants revolve around the controller,trying to ﬁt into the form the controller dictates, with the helpof the rejector!The center of the universe is therefore shifted from the modelof the plant to the controller. All imperfections and uncertaintiesin the process are lumped into what is known as total disturbanceto be rejected. In other words, instead of making a controlleradjust to the process, like in adaptive or robust control, the processis made “disturbance-free”, by the rejector, to adjust to what thecontroller is designed for. This, after all, is the authentic doctrineof control, as Han anticipated some 20 years ago, where theproblem of automatic control is not assumed away and wherethe problem of disturbance has returned to its proper place:the center and focus of automatic control. There will be a periodof transition, of course, perhaps a generation or more, for thisCopernican-like revolution in automatic control to take its course,because it necessarily leads to the devaluation of certain principlesand methodologies previously held in high esteem. And it will be achallenging transition, to say the least, for the scholars who builttheir careers and reputations within the conﬁne of the moderncontrol paradigm. But this ideal of disturbance-free control capturesthe essence of what engineers all aspire to achieve and it willeventually prevail.5. Conclusions and outlookIn this paper, we ﬁrst reestablished the concepts of disturbance,disturbance rejection, and disturbance rejection control, the pillarsof the on-going investigation. In particular, the expanded notionof disturbance brings under a single umbrella both the state-dependent internal uncertainties and the unknown external for-ces. This gives us a new paradigm to address the problems of allmajor branches of modern control theory, such as robust control,nonlinear control, decoupling, adaptive control. In other words,most problems of robust control, nonlinear control, decoupling,adaptive control, etc., can be reformulated as particular formsof disturbance problem and solved in a completely new andexciting way.Furthermore, two important but otherwise unannounced prin-ciples of automatic control are articulated in this paper: theprinciple of disturbance accommodation and the principle ofdisturbance rejection, with the distinction between them settingthe stage for a new synthesis. The notion of disturbance rejector isproposed by which previously overlapping concepts and methodsof disturbance estimation and cancellation are now ﬁnally uniﬁed.The controller–rejector pair in the framework of disturbancerejection control signiﬁes a sea change in how we understandthe business of automatic control: from a model-centric to acontrol-centric cosmic view; it reminds us of the Copernicanrevolution in the early days of modern science. It helps us returnto the journey that started some thousand years ago: to make ourengineered systems disturbance-free.With the renewed focus on disturbance rejection and a freshnew look at automatic control, low hanging fruits abound in therealms of both academic research and technological develop-ments. Led by ADRC, this new form of solutions has found manyﬁelds of applications, including, but certainly not limited to,industrial controls such as servo, temperature, web tension; aero-space and aeronautics; high energy physics, to name a few. Thereaders are referred to [26] for a summary of these applications.Between the early work on ﬂight control [27] and the latest newson the adoption by the industry giant Texas Instruments [28], themounting evidence testiﬁes for the thesis of this paper: thecentrality of disturbance rejection in control engineering practice.There are enormous opportunities that come with the newparadigm of control science, including three areas of new dis-coveries that will likely see immense growth in the near future:principles, technologies and applications, as shown in Fig. 2. Inaddition, theoretical analysis and justiﬁcation are needed for allthree areas, just like the work of Bode and Nyquist which justiﬁedand made it intelligible the invention of feedback ampliﬁer.In particular, under principles, a summarily study of all princi-ples of controller and rejector design, once completed, should giveus a fresh new outlook on the state of automatic control anddirections for new discoveries. For example, Fliess and Sira-Ramirez's [24] work on algebraic identiﬁcation provides a drasti-cally different means for disturbance estimation in the future;Fliess and Join's [23] new take on model-free control threatens theconventional deﬁnition of the system order and gives a provokingnew distinction: the order of the process as it is understood andthat as it is controlled. The exposition of such distinction is of greatinterests but beyond of the scope of this paper.In terms of technologies, the new principles of disturbancerejection, as applied to address critical needs in every industrysectors, will likely lead to brand new control technologies. Thenew motion control technology based ADRC is but one example [28].Finally, in terms of applications, the domain experts, oncebrought up to speed with the new design concepts, will see thefundamental change in not just how control is designed, but alsohow systems and solutions are conceived. Shinskey [1] was rightin that this advanced concept of controller–rejector needs tobe communicated to those at the front line of production; thehundred-fold improvement he observed in the past and the over50% energy saving obtained recently are testaments of the powerof such ideas, as do the applications summarized in [26]. To thisend, the centrality of disturbance rejection and the objective ofdisturbance-free control should be ﬁrmly established in all futureapplication researches. To answer the earlier question, these arethe ideas and ideals that should be “applied” in future research inautomatic control.References[1] Shinskey FG. Process control systems.

We examine the effectiveness of periodic impulsive releases of biocontrol agents (beneficial species) into a two-patch environment through mathematical modeling. In this paper, we consider a spatio-temporal Lotka–Volterra pest–predator system defined over two patches. We show that the threshold predator release rate guaranteeing the stability of the pest-free solution is actually independent of the release period when predators in both patches follow balanced dynamics or pests do not disperse. Otherwise, the stability threshold becomes period-dependent and more specifically it is an increasing function of the release period. This implies that the deployment of biological control agents at a given release rate can possibly succeed if releases are frequent and small and fail otherwise. In the various cases we also show what the optimal strategy is that minimizes the total release rate or how to spread a given release rate between the two patches",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/article, Journal articles","impulsive control, dispersal, two-patch model, biological control, semi-discrete system, predator-prey model, [SDV]Life Sciences [q-bio]",,'Elsevier BV'

Firstly, in order to solve the problem that rumor and anti-rumor information of emergency events disseminate simultaneously in social networks, the model extracts the factors that affect information dissemination: user behavior characteristics, user closeness and heat influence of participating topics. Secondly, anti-rumor information and an evolutionary game mechanism are introduced into the traditional SIR model, binary information is introduced to analyze the anti-rumor dissemination model SDIR, and the four state transitions and dissemination processes of SDIR are discussed. Finally, the SDIR model is experimentally validated in different datasets and dissemination models. The experimental results show that the SDIR model is in line with the actual dissemination law, and it can be proved that high self-identification ability plays a certain role in suppressing rumors; the anti-rumor information effectively inhibits the spread of rumor information to a certain extent.

The analysis matched parasite communities of (i) L. haematocheilus across its native and introduced populations (Sea of Japan and Sea of Azov, respectively) and (ii) the introduced population of L. haematocheilus with native populations of M. cephalus (Mediterranean, Azov-Black and Japan Seas). The total mean abundance (TMA), as a feature of the infection level in helminth communities, and slope b of the Taylor’s power law, as a measure of parasite aggregation at the infra and component-community levels, were estimated and compared between host species and localities using ANOVA. The TMA of the whole helminth community in the introduced population of L. haematocheilus was over 15 times lower than that of the native population, but the difference was less pronounced for carried (monogeneans) than for acquired (adult and larval digeneans) parasite communities. Similar to the abundance pattern, the species distribution in communities from the invasive population of L. haematocheilus was less aggregated than from its native population for endoparasitic helminths, including adult and larval digeneans, while monogeneans showed a similar pattern of distribution in the compared populations of L. haematocheilus. The aggregation level of the whole helminth community, endoparasitic helminths, adult and larval digeneans was lower in the invasive host species in comparison with native ones as shown by differences in the slope b. An important theoretical implication from this study is that the pattern of parasite aggregation may explain the success of invasive species in ecosystems. Because the effects of parasites on host mortality are likely dose-dependent, the proportion of susceptible host individuals in invasive species is expected to be lower, as the helminth distribution in the invasive host was featured by a higher number of uninfected hosts and a shorter distribution tail when compared with native species",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/article, Journal articles","Liza haematocheilus, Mugil cephalus, Taylor’s law, Species abundance distribution, Total mean abundance, [SDV.MP.PAR]Life Sciences [q-bio]/Microbiology and Parasitology/Parasitology",,'Elsevier BV'

Existing approaches tend to address some aspects of information release, exposing the other aspects for possible attacks. It is striking that these approaches fall into two mostly separate categories: revelation-based (as in information purchase, aggregate computation, moves in a game, etc.) and encryption-based declassification (as in sending encrypted secrets over an untrusted network, storing passwords, etc.). This paper introduces gradual release, a policy that unifies declassification, encryption, and key release policies. We model an attacker's knowledge by the sets of possible secret inputs as functions of publicly observable outputs. The essence of gradual release is that this knowledge must remain constant between releases. Gradual release turns out to be a powerful foundation for release policies, which we demonstrate by formally connecting revelation-based and encryption-based declassification. Furthermore, we show that gradual release can be provably enforced by security types and effects",,Text.Article.Conference.PeerReviewed,,,

The sooner the authoritative information is introduced, the less negative impact the rumors will bring. We also get the result that heterogeneous networks are more prone to the spreading of rumors.

What is more, existing efforts on security metric mainly focus on the ease of certain attack from a theoretical point of view, ignoring the “likelihood of exploitation.” To help administrator have a better understanding, we analyze the behavior of attackers who exploit the zero-day vulnerabilities and predict their attack timing. Based on the prediction, we propose a method of security measurement. In detail, we compute the optimal attack timing from the perspective of attacker, using a long-term game to estimate the risk of being found and then choose the optimal timing based on the risk and profit. We design a learning strategy to model the information sharing mechanism among multiattackers and use spatial structure to model the long-term process. After calculating the Nash equilibrium for each subgame, we consider the likelihood of being attacked for each node as the security metric result.

We postulate that most vulnerabilities remain unattacked, and that the exploit development cycle relates to software updates rather than to the disclosure of new vulnerabilities. We develop a simple mathematical model to show the mechanisms underlying our observations and name it  The Work-Averse Attacker Model . We then leverage Symantec's data sharing platform WINE to validate our model by analysing records of attacks against more than 1M real systems. We find the 'Model of the Work-Averse Attacker' to be strongly supported by the data and, in particular, that: (a) the great majority of attacks per software version is driven by one vulnerability only; (b) an exploit lives two years before being substituted by a new one; (c) the exploit arrival rate depends on the software's update rate rather than on time or knowledge of the vulnerability.\u3c/p\u3",,,,,'Association for Information Systems'

ABSTRACT  THEORETICAL PREDICTION OF DRUG RELEASE IN GI TRACT  FROM SPHERICAL DOSAGE FORMS  by Naga Lakshmi Ramana Susarla  The significance of controlled release drug delivery systems (CRDDS) lies in their ability to deliver the drug at a steady rate thus reducing the dosage interval and providing a prolonged pharmacodynamic effect. But despite the steadily increasing practical importance of these devices, little is known regarding their underlying drug release mechanisms. Mathematical modeling of these drug delivery systems could help us understand the underlying mass transport mechanisms involved in the control of drug release. Mathematical modeling also plays an important role in providing us with valuable information such as the amount of drug released during a certain period of time and when the next dosage needs to be administered. Thus, potentially reducing the number of in-vitro and in-vivo experiments which in some cases are infeasible. There is a large spectrum of published mathematical models for predicting drug release from CRDDS in vitro following conventional approaches. These models describe drug release from various types of controlled delivery devices for perfect sink conditions. However in a real system (human body) a sink condition may not be applicable. For a CRDDS along with the physiochemical properties (solubility, diffusion, particle size, crystal form etc.) the physiological factors such as gastrointestinal tract (GI) pH, stomach emptying, (GI) motility, presence of food, elimination kinetics etc., also affect the rate of drug release. As the drug delivery system is expected to stay in the human body for a longer period of time when compared to a immediate release dosage form the process of drug release   occurs in conjunction with the absorption (for oral delivery systems) and elimination kinetics. Earlier work by Ouruemchi et.al.[71] include prediction of the plasma drug concentration for an oral diffusion controlled drug delivery system.

These devices help to deliver the drug at a controlled rate as opposed to the immediate release dosage forms, thus leading to a decrease in the number of dosages required and also reducing the possibility of side effects [1]. The devices can be in various sizes and shapes like spherical (nano or microparticles), cylindrical (millirods) or planar (thin films). The most common method of administration of these devices is either parenteral or via implants. The nanosized drug particles are expected to stay in the circulatory system for a long period of time without getting eliminated. Though oral route is not a common delivery option, a few studies have been done on utilizing the controlled drug delivery devices for oral drug delivery. The nanoparticle drug delivery system is either absorbed as a whole through the intestine walls or able to stay in the gastro intestinal system for a longer time thus releasing the drug in a controlled manner while protecting the drug from degradation [2].          There are various methods by which these devices are produced. The drug particle is  encapsulated or dispersed within a polymer matrix. The drug-polymer system is classified as either a matrix type or a reservoir system. In the case of a matrix system the drug is commonly assumed to be uniformly distributed within the polymer matrix where the initial drug loading is either lower than the solubility of the drug inside the matrix (dissolved system) or higher than the solubility of the drug inside the polymer matrix (dispersed system)[5]. In Reservoir systems the drug is assumed to be confined within a given geometry such as an outer radius R and inner radius r [5]. The drug release 2     mechanisms have been identified as (i) diffusion-controlled (ii) dissolution-controlled (iii) erosion-controlled (iv) degradation-controlled or (v) swelling-controlled. In some cases two or more of these processes could be controlling the rate of drug release with each becoming the rate-controlling step at a particular time.  Despite having many advantages the knowledge about the underlying drug release mechanisms for these devices is not fully developed [3]. Mathematical modeling of the drug release process can help us to improve the understanding of the underlying mass transport and chemical processes as well as optimize the dosage form dimensions to achieve targeted desired release profiles [4]. Mathematical modeling can also help to reduce the number of in-vitro and in-vivo experiments which are not only expensive but in some cases infeasible. There is a large spectrum of mathematical models available in the literature ranging from the classical models like those developed by Higuchi [6] and Peppas [4,7] to some of the recent models [8,9].  Most of these mathematical models are developed for in-vitro conditions where sink conditions are maintained. However when it comes to a real system (human body) various factors like absorption rate of the drug, drug distribution, metabolism and elimination within the system (which intern depend on factors such as pH, temperature, blood flow rate, presence of food etc., in the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract [10]) come into play which the regular models do not take into consideration. This can result in a severe discrepancy between the in-vitro and in-vivo correlations for drug release [11] The main objective of this work is to develop a mathematical model for prediction of drug release in the GI tract taking into account the absorption kinetics. When a CRDDS is administered orally it reaches the GI tract and releases the drug at a controlled 3     rate, the released drug is absorbed through the intestine wall and into the systemic circulation. After a certain period of time the drug release process and absorption of the drug occur in conjunction. Therefore absorption kinetics become important and they cannot be ignored. In this thesis an extensive review of mathematical models developed over the past decade is given (Chapter 2) followed by objectives (Chapter 3) and models developed (Chapter 4)   4 2. LITERATURE REVIEW   2.1  Mathematical Models for Diffusion and Diffusion-Degradation Controlled Drug Delivery Systems  Diffusion controlled drug delivery devices are very popular, the classical model describing solute release from a polymer matrix for various geometries was first developed by Crank [12]. As it will be seen from discussion to follow, most authors adopt this model to describe the process of drug release. Diffusion mechanism remains a part of drug release process even if it is not the rate controlling step. However a significant number of controlled release devices made now a days are either erosion or degradation controlled. Polymer degradation is defined as the chain scission process by which the polymer chains are cleaved into oligomers and monomers whereas erosion is defined as a process of material loss from polymer bulk [3]. Depending on the composition and geometry of the erodible device, numerous mass transport and chemical reaction phenomena affect the drug release kinetics. A few of them are (i) Water intrusion into the device (ii) drug dissolution (iii) polymer degradation (iii) creation of aqueous pores (iv) diffusion of the drug and/or polymer degradation products inside the polymer matrix (v) micro-environmental pH changes inside the polymer matrix pores by degradation products (vi) polymer swelling [3].         Charlier, A., et.al.,[13] proposed a diffusion-degradation model for the release of mifepristone an antiprogestative norsteroid drug from degradable PLGA planar matrix system. They postulated that the diffusion coefficient ( D ) depended on the polymer 5   Where k is the degradation constant and oM , oD  are the initial polymer molecular weight and corresponding diffusion coefficient, respectively. The amount of drug released in the assumption of steady state was taken as  0 .dQ C S dh  (2.2)                                                                                       Equations (2.1.1) and (2.1.2) were combined to give the final expression for the fraction of drug released as:  0 02 ( 1)ktsC C D eQ Sk    (2.3)                                                                                          Their results seemed to agree well with the experimental data and with the Higuchi equation [6] at early times. Liggins and Burt [14] studied paclitaxel release from poly (L-lactic acid) microspheres. The main focus of their study was the effect of molecular weight of polymer on the release rate. The amount of paclitaxel released from polymers of different molecular weight was studied for a period of 14 days, as perfect sink conditions were not maintained during the in vitro experiments, the saturation of paclitaxel was observed within 3 days. It was found that 11-76 % of the drug released over the period of 14 days. Because of the incomplete release of paclitaxel the authors hypothesized that the release kinetics could be explained using a „two compartmental model‟. In this model compartment 1 was hypothesized to contain paclitaxel that could freely diffuse from the microspheres while compartment 2 contained immobilized by semi crystalline polymer matrix. To test this hypothesis the authors related the fraction of paclitaxel remaining 6     within the microsphere after the release studies with the polymer crystallinity and molecular weight. The studies indicated that as the mw and crystallinity increase the fraction of paclitaxel remaining increased. The authors used Baker‟s equations [15] given below to fit theoretical curves to the experimental data.  221236rDtrDtMMot for 4.00 otMM                                                           (2.4)  2236122rDteMM rDtot for 16.0 otMM                                                     (2.5)  The authors also derived an empirical relationship between the polymer mw, crystallinity and diffusion coefficients. Though significant biodegradation of the polymer microspheres was observed after a period of 5 days the authors did not account for biodegradation in the model and only diffusion phenomena seemed to adequately account for the drug release. Wong et al. [16] studied the in vitro sustained release of human immunoglobulin G (IgG) from PLA and PLGA biodegradable microspheres. The authors used two different models to explain the release kinetics of IgG. They used the diffusion model and the diffusion/dissolution model. For both of these models two cases of mass transfer were considered, one with finite mass transfer coefficient at the surface and one with infinite mass transfer coefficient ( all the mathematical details are given below).  rCrrCDtC 222                                                                                                  (2.6)  The initial and boundary conditions taken are:  RrCCt in  00                                                                                           (2.7)  7     Case 1:   For infinite mass transfer the boundary conditions were taken as  000  rrCt      and   RrCCt  0                                                  (2.8)  The fraction of mass of drug released to total mass was obtained as   122222exp161nTt DtRnnMM                                                                           (2.9)  Case 2: a finite mass transfer coefficient on the surface was assumed such that the concentration in the surroundings is constant.

Abdekhodaie [18] presented an exact solution for the diffusional release from theophylline microspheres coated with ethyl vinyl acetate copolymer into a finite external volume using the Laplace transform method. The solute was assumed to have very low solubility in the polymeric membrane and the diffusion coefficient was assumed to be independent of concentration.

He et.al. [19] proposed a mathematical model accounting for polymer erosion and degradation. They considered a polymer matrix system where in the drug was molecularly dispersed. They assumed that the kinetics of the drug release from bioerodible polymer matrices followed a Fickian diffusion influenced by polymer degradation and that it accelerated at a certain time by polymer erosion. The polymer chain scission was described by first order auto catalyzed hydrolysis kinetics and the matrix was assumed to be fully eroded at the end of the drug release process. The authors 10     took into account the equations describing drug release by Fickian diffusion, developed by Baker and Lonsdale [20] and Ritger and Peppas [21] for spherical and disk matrix geometries, respectively. 2 26 3dDt Dtmr r                                                                                                     (2.24)  3 3 22 2 2 2 2 2 22 24 4 [8 2 ]3 3dDt Dt Dt Dt r Dt Dt Dtmr r r l l r r r                             (2.25)  They modified the diffusion coefficient in Equations (2.24) and (2.25) to exp( )t o sD D k t to account for the polymer degradation kinetics. Then the equations were combined with Equation (2.26) proposed by Fitzgerald and Corrigan [22] which describe the matrix erosion as a combined process of the branching and termination of polymer decomposition caused by formation of activated nuclei in the matrix.                                                                                          (2.26) Where em  is the fraction of drug released, ek  is the acceleratory coefficient describing the probability of branching from active sites during the time interval between oligomer generation and dissolution and MaxT  is the time to maximum matrix erosion rate. The total fraction of drug released obtained by combining Equations (2.23)-(2.26) is given by Equations (2.27) and (2.28).All the parameters needed to solve these Equations were taken from the literature. 2 23 exp( )61 exp( )t t t e e MaxEe e MaxM D t D t k t k TFM r r k t k T                                                               (2.27) exp( )1 exp( )e e Maxee e Maxk t k Tmk t k T     11     3 3 22 2 2 2 2 2 22 24 4 8 23 3exp( )1 exp( )t t t t t t t te e MaxEe e MaxM D t D t D t D t D t D t D trM r r r l l r r rk t k TFk t k T                               (2.28) Where EF  is the factor accounting for the contribution of matrix erosion to drug released. It indicates that a fraction of drug originally released through diffusion is now released through matrix erosion. The proposed model was able to describe triphasic drug release kinetics for bioerodible polymeric matrices which included an initial burst phase (caused by high initial drug release rate due to short diffusion pathways), an intermediate phase (an approximately zero order drug release phase resulting from drug diffusion and polymer degradation) and a second rapid drug release phase due to matrix erosion. Raman et al. [23] developed a mathematical model to study the affect of polymer degradation and nonuniform drug distribution on the release of small molecules from degradable microspheres. The authors considered a diffusion coefficient which is dependent on polymer molecular weight.  rCMDrrrtCW )(1 22                                                                                      (2.29)  The boundary conditions used were:  00rtC                                                                                                                 (2.30)    0RrC                                                                                                                     (2.31)  The initial condition used:    )(0 rfrC t                                                                                                                (2.32)  12     The model contained one fit parameter  0D  which was used until the time dependent diffusivity [ ( )]wD M  was larger than 0D  . The authors solved Equations (2.29) - (2.32) using an adaptive Runge-Kutta methods using fifth and sixth order Runge- Kutta formulas to estimate error of integration. And since the molecular weight of the microspheres did not change for the first 4 days, the molecular weight loss was modeled as: 0W W lagM M t t                                                                                     (2.33)  ( )0d lagk t tW W lagM M e t t                                                                                  (2.34)  The release profiles generated by model were compared to the experimental data. The model was found to be a good fit to the data. Faisant et al. [24] developed a simple mathematical model to elucidate the underlying drug release mechanisms of 5-FU (a drug used for fighting cancer) from PLGA erodible microspheres which exhibited a biphasic release profile (an intial burst phase followed by a zero order release phase). The system considered was a monolithic system (drug dispersed within the polymer matrix), where the drug was release by diffusion.

D  is taken as apparent diffusivity taking into account the drug transfer through the polymer itself as well as possible drug transfer through water-filled nanopores. When equation (2.36) was fitted to the experimental drug release profile it was only able to describe the intial burst phase well but not the second zero-order release phase. A major assumption made in obtaining the above equation was that of monolithic solutions. So the authors adopted the Koizumi and Panomsuk [25] model (Equation (2.37)) to describe the drug release profile. They then combined Equation (2.37) with Equations (2.38) and (2.39) to account for the polymer degradation.         3294)(24002ssssstCCCRDtCDtCCCRM                                     (2.37)            MwkDMwD  0)(                                                                                              (2.38)      )exp(4.78)( deg tktMw r                                                                                        (2.39)   Here rkdeg is the pseudo-first order degradation rate constant. The mathematical model was fitted to the experimental drug release profile using C++ program and it was found that the model was able to describe both the phases adequately. However there still were deviations between the experimental data and model. The authors concluded that these discrepancies could have occurred since not all the important physicochemical phenomena were taken into account. Though the drug release process is primarily controlled by diffusion phenomena there is a significant contribution by the polymer degradation process. During the degradation process water inhibition occurs thus 14     decreasing the average molecular weight of the macromolecules, leading to increased diffusion coefficients.  Siepmann et al. [26] quantitatively studied the effect of size of biodegradable microspheres on the drug release rate. They studied the release of 5-Fluorouracil from PLGA microspheres applying a diffusion-degradation model [24]. The microspheres were prepared such that the initial drug loading is much higher than the solubility. The polymer matrix was in rubbery state. The polymer degradation was observed to follow pseudo-first order kinetics and the diffusion coefficient of the drug was seen to increase monotonically with time. The authors used Equation (2.37) developed by Koizumi and Panomsuk [25] for spherical non-erodible systems and combined it with Equation (2.39) to account for polymer degradation. The mathematical model was implemented using C++ program. The authors found that as the size of the microparticles did not significantly effect the polymer degradation kinetics. However with increase in microsphere size the amount of initial drug loading increased and so did the amount of drug released. The reason for this was attributed to the increase in internal porosity of the microsphere with the increase in initial drug loading. Upon the increase of drug depletion the apparent drug diffusivities increased thus resulting in greater drug release rates. The authors also established a correlation for drug diffusivity and initial loading:  scmwwgdrugloadinD2140 10)))/%((21.0exp(4.2                                               (2.40)  The model (Equations (2.37) and (2.39)) was able to predict the drug release profile for particles of various sizes and the size of the particle was found to play a very important role in achieving the desired drug release profile. 15     It is interesting to note that Berkland et al. [27] in their study found that as the size of microsphere increased the rate of drug release decreased. In their study the authors prepared piroxicam and rhodamine (NSAID) loaded microspheres in the size range of 1-100 µm. The drug loading were about 1-20 %. The initial rate of drug release decreased with increase in the particle size. The release profile for large diameter microspheres followed a three-phase type of a release (an initial burst, an intermediate phase and a second rapid release phase) whereas the drug release from small diameter microparticles was uniform and it reached saturation after sometime. The reason for this was attributed to the decrease in area/volume ratio with the increase in particle size. The authors concluded that the large diameter microspheres were of a better application for prolonged release of drug. The conclusions drawn by Siepmann et.al.,[26] and Berkland et.al., [27] are drastically different. A possible reason for this could be that different polymers and different drug loading % were considered by both the authors respectively. The porosity of PLGA [26] could have increase with the increase in the particle size causing a rapid diffusion process as compared to PLG [27].          Siepmann et al. [28] quantitatively studied the effect of composition of the device (type and amount of plasticizer, type of polymer) on the diffusivities of the drug and its release kinetics. They chose water-insoluble polymers and considered monolithic solutions (dissolved systems) of planar and spherical geometries for the study. They applied Equations (2.37) – (2.39) to describe the process of drug release. They used theophylline as the model drug incorporated into 6 different plasticizers. They found that the diffusivities varied for different type of plasticizers and the amount of drug released was higher when large amounts of plasticizers were used. Also there was a pronounced 16     effect of type of polymer (polymers of different chain length) on the drug diffusivity as well. The authors explained these phenomena using the free volume theory (FVT) of diffusion that is the plasticizing effect of a substance is based on the reduction of the attractive forces between polymer chains. Decreasing attractive forces leads to increased mobilities of the macromolecules. According to FVT, the diffusion occurs by localized activated jumps from one pre existing cavity to another [29] .When the diffusing species is larger than a pre-existing cavity, a certain number of monomer segments must first be rearranged to allow the diffusion of the molecule. In this step the mobility of the polymer chain is the decisive factor for the mass transfer rate. High mobilities lead to high rearrangement rates and thus to high drug diffusion rates. A quantitative relationship was developed for dependence of D  on the type and amount of plasticizer as follows:  10 2(% ) 0.135.exp(0.121.% ).10D TBC TBC cm s                                                     (2.41)   Siepmann et al. [30] also studied the effect of drugs on the polymeric systems. Here the drugs themselves were considered to act as plasticizers. For device optimization it is important to know the effect of plasticizer on drug mobility within the polymeric system. The quantitative understanding of this phenomenon plays a vital role in controlled release formulations. The authors considered monolithic solution systems with planar geometries. They studied the effect of three drugs (metoprolol tartrate, chelorpheniramine maleate and ibuprofen) on Eudraigit RS polymeric films. It was found that ibuprofen had more impact on the thermal (glass transition temperature) and mechanical properties (elongation) of the polymer than the other two drugs, however metoprolol tartarate released much faster than the other two drugs. One possible explanation for this is given to be the electrostatic interactions between drug and 17     polymer. Ibuprofen being negatively charged (at pH 7.4) interacts with the positively charged quaternary ammonium ions groups of Eudraigit RS thus hindering the diffusion. Equations (2.37) to (2.39) were used to describe the drug release process from the monolithic solution systems into perfect sink conditions (in-vitro). This model was also useful in predicting the effect of initial loading and optimizing the dose dimensions to get the required release profiles.    Klose et al. [31] studied the effect of porosity and particle size on the drug release kinetics. They studied the release of Lidocaine from porous PLGA loaded microspheres (7.5µm-75µm). In their previous paper Siepmann, et.al., [32] studied the drug release from non-porous polymer matrices. For both porous and non porous lidocaine loaded microspheres Equation (2.36) was used to describe the drug release mechanism. The following assumptions were made (i) at time t=0 the drug was considered to be homogeneously distributed throughout the microsphere (ii) diffusion mechanism was solely responsible for drug release out of the microsphere (iii) there is no diffusional resistance for the drug release (iv) perfect sink conditions were maintained through out the (in-vitro) experiment. For a non-porous system the autocatalytic effect seemed to play a major role, but for porous microspheres autocatalytic effect was negligible and also as the pores increased in size so did the amount of drug released. Equation (2.36) could not describe the latter system adequately. This may be also partly due to the fact that as the size of pores increase the degradation of the polymer also increased which was not accounted for. Cruz et al. [33] studied the diffusional release of drug from three types of nanocarriers (nanoemulsions (NE), nanocapsules (NC) and nanospheres (NS)). They 18     developed a mathematical model (Equations (2.42)-(2.43)) using MicroMath Scientist to analyze the probe disappearance profile. They also used this model to analyze the release profiles of indomethacin loaded and indomethacin ethyl ester loaded NE, NC and NS 0ktC C e                                                                                                                      (2.42)   1 2k t k tC ae be                                                                                                            (2.43)                                                                                                   It was found that the release profiles for all three types of indomethacin loaded nanocarriers were well described by monoexponential model (Equation (2.41)). However biexponential model (Equation (2.42)) was found to be a better fit for release profile of indomethacin from ethyl ester loaded nanocarriers. Though the model fitted the experimental data well, it does not provide any insight into the underlying transport mechanisms responsible for drug release phenomena. The drug release from lipid based implants was studied by Guse et al. [34]. Glycerol-trimyristate, -tripalmitate and –tristearate were used as model lipids and lysozyme and pyranine were used as model drugs. The drugs were compressed to form cylindrical geometries. The analytical solution for Fick‟s second law of diffusion (Equation (2.44)) was used to describe the drug release process from lipid implants [35]. It is interesting to note that the drug release profile differed significantly with the type of lipid used. When the drug loadings were low the model was able to describe the drug release process well, but at higher loadings the model could not explain the drug release profile. The authors also applied the model to describe the pyranine release from microspheres coated with PLGA layer. The model was able to describe the tri-phasic release profile well. The authors also found that the drug release profile changed significantly with varying compression strength. 19           2 2 22 2 2 2 21 032 1 1 (2 1)1 exp( ) exp( )(2 1)t nn pnM q pDt DtM q R p H                         (2.44)   Lao et al. [36] developed a mathematical model to study the release behavior of paclitaxel (drug used for treating cancer) from biodegradable blended polymers. The drug release profile showed biphasic behavior. The drug release process was believed to follow three steps: (i) solvent penetration into the matrix (ii) a degradation-dependent “relaxation of the network” creating more free volume for the drug dissolution and (iii) finally the drug diffusion into the surrounding medium. Models were developed to describe the drug release process into perfect sink from pure PCL and PLGA films as well as blended films. Equation (2.45) which is the solution for Fick‟s second law of diffusion for a planar system [12] was combined with equation (2.46) which describes the kinetics of initial burst as developed by Batycky [37].         2 222 208 (2 1)1 exp4(2 1)tndiffM D n tlM n                                                 (2.45)       1 exp( )t bburstMk tM                                                                                             (2.46)    , ,2 2,2, 2 20{1 exp( )}8 (2 1) ( ){1 exp4(2 1)tb PCL b PCLPCLPCL b PCLb PCLnMk tMD n t tln                          (2.47)                                                          For neat PLGA films a second term comes into picture (Equation (2.48)) because degradation-dependent relaxation of PLGA chains plays a critical role in drug dissolution and release process. 20      , , , , ,2 2,2, 2 20{1 exp( )} [ ( )] 1}8 (2 1) ( ){1 exp4(2 1)tb PLGA b PLGA b PLGA r PLGA b PLGAPLGAPLGA b PLGAb PLGAnMk t Exp k t tMD n t tln                 (2.48)                   As paclitaxel is expected to stay in the system for a period of 3 months, a blend of these two polymers is desired as PCL degrades too soon while PLGA takes a long time. When blended theses polymers form two phases (one with PCL rich phase and one PLGA rich phase) because of their low miscibility. Thus the authors adopted a heuristic approach (Equation (2.49)) postulating that: “the drug partitions into each phase and remains there until released and the drug follows same mechanism of release for the respective phase”.

For this case the model results varied significantly from the experimental data. The explanation for this deviation was given as follows: as the blend model assumes that the total release is a sum of drug release contribution by two phases, the drug from each phase is released through interconnected paths of its own phase across the film. When the weight fraction of one of the component, is reduced considerably it is expected that the minor component 21     will assume the form of isolated islets in the major phase. The interconnectivity of the minor phase is thus lost. Therefore the drug released from the minor phase in this case PCL phase would be disrupted. Equations (2.45) through (2.52) were fit to the experimental data using MATLAB programming. Muschert et al. [38] studied the release of diltiazem HCl from ethyl cellulose coated pellets. In order to determine the diffusion coefficient of drug within the coat the authors applied the Equations (2.45) .The authors also found that by changing osmolality the drug release profile varied greatly.

This phenomenon becomes especially important when the drugs are sparingly soluble.  Ayres and Lindstrom [39] developed a mathematical model taking into account both diffusion and dissolution phenomenon to explain the release kinetics of topically applied ointment (cortisone) through skin and into the blood stream. They assumed the diffusion coefficient to be constant. The equations describing the mass transport of the drug through the suspension (ointment) and a permeable barrier (skin) to a perfect sink are given as follows:  0)( 1121211 xLCCKxCDtCs                                                     (2.59)  The equation for diffusion through medium II is given as:       222222 00 LxtxCDtC                                                            (2.60)  The initial conditions are given as:       0)0,( 11  xLCxC s                                                                             (2.61) 23           22 00)0,( LxxC       (2.62)         The boundary conditions assumed were      0),0(),0( 21  ttPCtC                                                                         (2.63)    0),0(),0( 2211 txtCDxtCD                                                                             (2.64)      0011 txCLx                                                                            (2.65)    00),( 22  ttLC                                                                             (2.66)   Equations (2.59)-(2.66) were solved using Laplace transform method.

The authors also studied two special cases to emphasize the effect of K  on the drug release process. 25     Case 2)( Di  implies that the mass transport through the skin is carried out infinitely fast. This represents a case when the ointment is directly applied to open wounds. Now asK  the solution phase concentration phase distribution in medium I (the ointment) tend to stay at a saturated concentration sC  which was well predicted by the model. The cumulative drug mass uptake by the blood versus time curves showed that when 0Konly finite amount of original solution phase drug in the ointment can be taken up by the blood because this is the only drug mass available to be taken up. However, for 0K , the blood uptake of the drug distribution of time can be seen.  The classical Higuchi equation (1961) can be recasted into the notion of proposed model as Equation (2.74) and compared with the cumulative amount of drug taken up by the receptor (Equation (2.73)). The difference between these two Equations was that but  was proportional to t  for large values of time whereas H  is proportional to t  at all times.   101 )12(LMMtD DTH    (where H stands for classical model)                                (2.74)  Following a similar procedure as case (i) the authors obtained the drug release profiles for case (ii) 1D  which corresponds to the transport rate limiting step in the skin. It was found that initially ( 4/1t  day) drug was lost rapidly from the ointment to the surface layer of the skin. For 0K about 87% of the drug was found to be lost from the ointment by the end of day 1. Since there is no dissolution from the suspension when 0K , the only available drug is that in the solution phase initially. With the blood capillary system supposedly forming a perfect sink for the drug, both 1C  and 02 C  as 26     time t . When 0K , a finite steady state in the skin is easily observed as timet . At small times, a rapid loss of drug from the ointment was observed. However, as time progresses the drug released from the ointment is being replaced by the finite dissolution rate process occurring in the suspension (medium I). From the drug release plots, it can also be inferred that as K value increases a deficit zone is generated. The drug in the ointment releases too rapidly for the drug to be replaced by dissolution from the suspension. Thus, by varying the values of K  the authors obtained several plots for cumulative amount of drug taken by the blood and the cumulative mass loss of drug from the ointment. The drug release profiles differed greatly with the value of K , therefore establishing that the rate of dissolution has a significant role to play in the process of drug release. The authors concluded that the factors affecting the drug release process from semisolid suspensions are (i) powder density of particle size, (ii) partition coefficient between the vehicle and receptor phase, (iii) solubility of the drug in the vehicle, (iv) area of application, (v) viscosity of the vehicle, (vi) temperature and (vii) the total time the drug remains in contact with the receptor. The same authors in a different paper [40] proposed a solution based on numerical methods to predict drug release from suspension of drug in semisolid vehicles.

Plots for cumulative release of ointment as a function of time were obtained for different K  and 0  values. Though the model results were in good agreement with the Higuchi model [39] the release profiles were quite different. Cortisone powder was taken as the model drug.   Frenning and Stromme [41] developed a mathematical model taking into account drug dissolution, diffusion and immobilization to explain the delayed release of NaCl from agglomerated micronized cellulose. Following assumptions were made for the model development (i) the tablet contains a large number of drug crystals, of approximately same size and shape, dispersed into an insoluble matrix. (ii) When in contact with water, the tablet breaks up into a number of approximately spherical tablet fragments. (iii) Liquid absorption and tablet disintegration rate are much faster than the drug dissolution. Accordingly, the initial state is characterized by virtually complete liquid absorption, matrix swelling and disintegration but negligible drug dissolution. (iv) The surrounding liquid is well mixed, so that its concentration is independent of the space coordinates. The drug flux within each fragment was assumed to be caused by diffusion.

The numerically computed release profiles were in excellent agreement with the experimental data. Frenning [46] developed a semi analytical solution for the release of slowly dissolving drugs from planar matrix systems and later on extended the idea to develop a model for spherical system [47]. Assumptions made for the model development are: (i) A planar matrix system is considered (ii) the boundary at 0x  is assumed to be impenetrable to the drug, while the matrix is in contact with liquid at Lx   (iii) the matrix is at all times in contact with a well stirred medium with volume large enough to maintain sink conditions. (iv) The liquid absorption is much faster than the drug dissolution and subsequent release (v) all the drug is present in solid form initially.

By keeping only the   linear terms Equations (2.100) and (2.101) are converted into linear PDEs and solved   using Laplace transform method. The final fraction of drug released was obtained as:  11 )1(n nsnsnsseseFkCQnn                                                                                   (2.112)  This equation is able to account for the decrease in surface area as opposed to the solution given by Aryes and Lindstrom [39] which assumes that the surface area remains constant. However, this Equation is only valid during early stages of the release process. Equations (2.100) and (2.101) were also solved numerically by using the FORTRAN routine D03PCF which was provided to them by The Numerical Algorithms Group (NAG, United Kingdom), this routine reduces the PDEs to ODEs and the resulting ODE system is solved by using backward differentiation formula method [48]. The drug release profiles obtained from the semi-analytical solution (Equation (2.112)) and numerical solution were compared with Crank‟s Equation (Equation (2.113)) and adjusted Higuchi Equation (2.114) proposed by Bunge [49] which were developed for the case of instantaneous dissolution. 14/)12(2222)12(81)1,,()( limnnskenCkQQ                                     (2.113) ss CCQ  212                                                                                        (2.114) 34     It was seen that as the k  and sC  values were varied the rate of drug released also varied. The drug release profile obtained by the semi-analytical equation and the numerical solution were in good agreement with each other. The authors concluded that by retaining the non linear terms the overestimation of the fraction of drug released could be avoided which normally occurs due to linearized treatment of the problem. Polakovic et al. [50] adopted two mathematical models to describe the release of lidocaine from PLA nanospheres. They applied the diffusion model and dissolution model separately to describe lidocaine release from nanospheres. They found that the diffusion model Equation (2.115) – (2.116) [12] accounted well for the drug release from particles containing low drug loadings and dissolution model (Eq. (2.117)) accounted well for drug release from particles with higher drug loading. For the derivation of dissolution model they assumed that (i) the dissolution of lidocaine crystals was the rate-controlling step implying a homogeneous distribution of drug within the matrix.(ii) The mass of dissolved drug inside the particle was negligible compared to the crystalline drug form. (iii) As the crystal specific area was unknown, the driving force of dissolution was defined as the difference of the concentration of the solid drug and its equilibrium concentration corresponding to the bulk liquid drug content.  12221 )exp()(99)1(61nnn RtDqqcc                                                                  (2.115)  233tannnnqqq                                                                                                         (2.116)  )]1exp(1[)1(01 ktKccP                                                                              (2.117)  35     It was observed that for low drug loading the process of drug release was controlled by diffusion process whereas at high drug loadings the drug release process was controlled by dissolution process.      When, compared with the model developed by Frenning [46, 47] Polakovic‟s model does not predict the initial time delay for drug release, but is valid for drug release over all time periods. Jo et al. [51] applied Polakovic‟s model (Equation (2.117)) to describe the dissolution controlled release of indomethacin from PLG-PEO nanospheres. However, for modeling diffusion controlled drug release the authors proposed a new model (Equation (2.118)) which contradicts the classical solution given by Crank [12] for the release of solute from a spherical matrix due to diffusion. 12221 )exp()(39)1(61nnn RtDqqcc                                                                  (2.118) Notice that the coefficient in the denominator of Equation (2.118) differs from Equation (2.115). Their observations were in agreement with Polakovic‟s observations, that for small particles diffusion was the main mechanism controlling the drug release process whereas for larger nanospheres dissolution was more dominant in controlling the drug release process. However, the dissolution model significantly under predicted the drug release profile when compared to the diffusion model.  2.3 Mathematical Models for Prediction of Drug Release In Vivo  There are various factors that affect the process of drug release. The size of the drug particles and the type of polymer used has an effect of the rate of drug release apart from the transport processes involved. The effect of acidic pH on the degradation and release 36     of dexamethosone from PLGA microspheres was investigated by Zolnik B.S and Burgess [52, 53]. They reported that there was no evident effect of pH on the burst phase of the release however the pH did significantly affect the second phase of release (bi-phasic release). Faisant et.al. [54] found that the drug release profile from microspheres were markedly different for different osmolalities, temperatures and pH. Excipients also seem to have an effect on drug release rate [55, 56]. All the models discussed so far have been for in-vitro drug release kinetics wherein perfect sink conditions are maintained. And all the factors recognized to be affecting the drug release process are physiochemical in nature. However when it comes to a real system (human body) the physiological factors also come into play. The presence of food, type of food, blood flow rate to the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract, GI tract motility etc., are a few of them [10]. Presence of one drug in the system before the admission of another drug can also effect the absorption rate of drug in the GI tract [57]. Mechanistic modeling cannot be applied directly for prediction of amount of drug in the system (plasma). This is where physiological or compartmental modeling might reveal better information. While mechanistic modeling is concerned with understanding the underlying drug release phenomena compartmental modeling is concerned with understanding the physiological phenomena [58]. Pharmacokinetic modeling can broadly be classified as: One compartmental modeling, two compartmental modeling, multi compartmental modeling [10, 59] and physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling [60]. There are also various compartmental model developed for orally administered drugs taking into account the hepatic first pass metabolism, GI tract motility, absorption in small intestine etc., [61, 62, 63, 64]. In one compartmental model the whole body is thought of as one compartment and the absorption and 37     elimination kinetics of the drug are studied, where as in two compartmental modeling a second compartment accounting for drug uptake by the tissue is also considered. In physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling the pertinent biochemical and physiological constants for metabolism and solubility in each compartment are included. Routes of dosing are included in their proper relationship to the overall physiology. Each compartment in the model is described by differential mass balance equations whose terms mathematically represent the biological process [60]. These equations are then solved using numerical methods and software packages [10]. There is a large spectrum of pharmacokinetic models available in the literature [10, 57, 58, 59], but most of these models consider the entire drug to be present in the compartment at time t = 0 which is not the case with controlled release drug delivery devices. Therefore there are discrepancies in the in-vitro in-vivo correlations [65, 66, and 67]. There are very few models which take into account both the in-vitro parameters (like diffusion coefficient) and the in-vivo parameters like absorption and elimination coefficients. Nia et.al., [68] developed a simple mathematical model taking into accounting both in-vitro and in-vivo parameters to calculate the amount of drug released into the plasma for a diffusion controlled oral dosage form. They made the following assumptions: (i) the oral dosage form was cylindrical in shape and the drug concentration was uniform initially (ii) the process of drug release out of the dosage form is solely controlled by diffusion (iii)  the drug releases out of the dosage into the GI tract thereby is absorbed into the blood compartment and eliminated.

They considered two dosage forms one immediate release dosage form and another erosion controlled dosage form. The calculated release profiles for both the dosages were compared and it was found that the rate constant of elimination played a significant role. Drug release profiles were compared for both single dosage and multiple dosages. The erosion–controlled release profiles showed a steady release rate compared to the immediate release profiles.

The release of estradiol from the patch was modeled by considering the Fick‟s law of diffusion to describe the drug release from a homogeneous layer. The following assumptions were made: (i) as estradiol has good water solubility, the stratum corneum (skin) is the primary barrier of concern and no additional diffusion step through the viable dermis is considered. (ii) Initially the skin and the capillaries are free of drug. (iii) The efflux through the left side of the patch is zero. (iv) The efflux from the patch compartment at 0x  equals the input flux into the skin compartment and the efflux from right side of the skin to the blood capillaries follows a first order rate constant dk . (v) The estradiol release from the patch at 0x  is assumed to follow the Higuchi law which was in accordance with the in vitro experiments performed. The mass efflux rate out of the patch/skin system was given as: 22xCDdtdm                                                                                                            (2.147)  Where D  is constant diffusivity, C  is the concentration, t  is the time and x  is the integration path through the skin and L is the thickness of the skin.

The inverse Laplace transform for equation (2.151) was performed numerically [74]. Weinberg et al. [75] presented a model to simulate doxorubicin transport in non-ablated and radiofrequency (RF) ablated liver tumor. The method of ablation using RF is known to have improved efficacy in treatment where 80% of the tumors cannot be removed by surgery. The authors applied the computational modeling technique using finite element method implemented in COMSOL 3.3. One-dimensional and three-dimensional models were used to simulate the intratumoral doxorubicin release from PLGA millirods. The doxorubicin transport into the tumor from these implants was analyzed using the following Equation:  2C D C Ct                                                                                                         (2.152)  Here   represents the elimination coefficient. 45      The boundary conditions taken were              ; ( )IBr R C f t                                                                                                           (2.153)  ; 0OBr R C                                                                                                               (2.154)  Here IBR , OBR  represent the inner implant boundary and the maximum extent of normal  liver tissue included in the model.

Isqcurvefit function in MATLAB 7.1 was applied for implementation of curve fitting. In, the case of ablated tumors it was observed that the model did not yield a close fit when constant D  and   values were used. Therefore for more accurate prediction of drug transport the authors considered the diffusion coefficient to be a function of radius and elimination coefficient to be a function of time.          The RF ablation reduced the drug elimination rate from the implant and also increased the diffusion process thus providing an effective treatment. Overall the computational model provided an adequate fit for the drug release profile for ablated tumors and it was found to be a useful tool for future studies like predicting the changes in drug release profile with change in implant design and also for clinical applications.  46  CHAPTER 3  OBJECTIVES   Controlled release drug delivery systems (CRDDS) have several advantages over conventional dosage forms, they are able to reduce the discrepancies in the therapeutic regime by delivering the drug in a controlled manner. Mathematical modeling for such systems not only helps us in identifying the underlying transport mechanisms responsible for the drug release but also helps in reducing the number of experiments needed. In vitro and in vivo experiments are not only very expensive but in some cases they are infeasible, in such situations mathematical models can aid in reducing the number of experiments needed [75].          As seen from the discussions above, there are many models describing drug release from CRDD forms for in vitro conditions. And these models help us in recognizing the underlying drug transport mechanisms for these conditions. But when it comes to an actual biological system there are a number of parameters both physiological and physiochemical which may influence the rate of drug release. Conventional pharmacokinetic modeling is also performed taking the entire drug to be present in the system once (immediate release systems), which cannot be applicable to controlled release or extended release dosage forms [76]. As controlled release dosages are expected to stay within the system over a period of few weeks to few months, these devices may undergo number of changes which are not accounted for both in the in vitro experiments and in mathematical models developed.  47             The model applied by Ouriemchi [71] and other [69, 70] clearly shows that the absorption and elimination rate coefficients play a major role in the drug release process. However none of these models take into account the effect of absorption rate kinetics on rate of drug release. The objectives of the present work are (1) to develop a mathematical model for a diffusion-dissolution controlled drug delivery system [47] and analyze the effect of absorption rate on the rate of drug release. (2) To study the effect of diffusion, drug dissolution and rate of absorption on rate of drug release. (3) Compare the models to established models [47, 51] which do not take absorption rate into account.  A closed form solution was obtained for prediction of drug released from a diffusion controlled drug delivery system taking into account the absorption kinetics [77]. This can be considered as a reduced case of the diffusion-dissolution problem. Results show that absorption rate has a significant effect on the drug release profile within the GI tract.  A numerical approach is followed to obtain the solution for a dissolution-diffusion controlled drug delivery model (including all nonlinearities). An approximate analytical solution and an asymptotic solution are also derived. Results from these models are given in the proceeding sections.   48  CHAPTER 4 MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF DRUG RELEASE FROM SPHERICAL MATRIX SYSTEMS: ANALYSIS OF THE AFFECT OF FINITE DISSOLUTION RATE AND ABSORPTION RATE ON THE RATE OF DRUG RELEASE   4.1 Introduction  The phenomenon of drug dissolution plays a very important role in the drug release kinetics. The drug dissolution rate has pronounced effect on the drug absorption. Noyes – Whitney equation is most commonly applied for describing the drug dissolution process.  Most of the pharmacokinetic models are also developed taking into account the drug dissolution kinetics. However for the case of a CRDDS drug diffusion also plays a major role in drug release process. And in some cases the encapsulated drug dissolution can also become a rate controlling step as seen in section 2.2.  Thus both drug dissolution and diffusion contribute towards the drug release process. Frenning [47] developed a model to predict the amount of drug released from a polymer matrix containing solid drug particles. Unlike the existing models the developed model accounted for the change in particle size. Thus capturing the phenomena of delayed release of the drug which is seen during the initial stage of drug release process. However,  the model was developed for sink conditions and did not take into account the absorption kinetics of the drug through the GI tract. In the preceding section a new model is proposed which takes into account the diffusion-dissolution equations proposed by Frenning as well as the absorption kinetics through the GItract.49    4.2 Problem Description Consider an encapsulated drug in a polymer matrix system. The drug is uniformly dispersed within the spherical matrix and it is in crystalline form. When the drug reaches the GI tract the fluid from the surroundings diffuses into the sphere and dissolves some of the drug. Therefore, at one point there is both dissolved and undissolved drug present within the polymer matrix. The dissolved drug then enters into the GI tract where it is eventually absorbed. Following absorption in the GI tract the drug thereby enters into the plasma compartment. The rate of absorption depends on various factors such as the amount of food present in the stomach, type of food taken, pH etc., [11]. This situation can be interpreted as an encapsulated drug matrix system of radius R  and volume sV   placed in a liquid compartment of finite volume lV  .The concentration of the solid drug within the matrix is taken as S . The concentration of dissolved drug in the matrix is taken as C .The drug enters the liquid phase by the process of mass diffusion at timet 0= . The concentration of the drug in the liquid phase is taken as lC . A well- stirred tank assumption is made such that lC  is independent of position. Thereby the drug is consumed by a first order absorption (Figure 4.1). Assumptions 1. A matrix type of a system is considered wherein the drug particles are encapsulated within a polymer matrix. The entire drug is assumed to be present in solid form initially. 2. As the liquid enters the matrix, some of the drug is dissolved, and released into the compartment (simulating the GI tract) through the process of diffusion. At some point there is both dissolved and undissolved drug present within the matrix. 50     3. The drug releases from the polymer matrix into the GI tract. Only absorption of the drug in the GI tract is considered and the transport of the drug into the plasma compartment is not considered. Thus the effect of absorption rate on the rate of drug release in the GI tract is the only consideration. 4. Initially no drug is present in the liquid compartment. 5. When the rate of diffusion and drug dissolution are fast rate of absorption is expected to become the rate controlling step.       Figure 4.1 Schematic Representation of Drug Release from Dissolution Controlled    Drug Delivery System in the GI Tract.   4.3 Model Development The basic equations governing the system Equations (5.1) and (5.2) were originally introduced by Frenning [47]. The same nomenclature has been retained. The first term on the RHS of Equation (4.1) accounts for the diffusion of the dissolved drug and the second term accounts for the dissolution of solid drug particles.   k  rk  Perfectly stirred compartment  Drug Particle Absorption Rate 51     )(2 32022CCSSkrCrrCDtCsAB                                                                 (4.1) )(320CCSSktSs                                                                                                 (4.2) Surface boundary condition subject to absorption in the GI tract is treated here as:  lrlllRrABs CkVdtdCVrCDVR3                                                                       (4.3)  Boundary conditions:  0)0,( rC                                                                                                                       (4.4)  0)0( lC                                                                                                                         (4.5)  lKCC       at    Rr                                                                                                     (4.6)  0),0(0rrCOrfiniteistC                                                                                     (4.7)  Equations (4.1)-(4.7) are converted into dimensionless form using the following dimensionless variables:  Dimensionless concentration of undissolved (solid) drug soSS                                (4.8)        Dimensionless concentration of dissolved drug oSC                                                (4.9)                                               Dimensionless concentration of dissolved drug present in the liquid compartment   l ploC KS                                                                                                                       (4.10) Dimensionless solubility:   soCS                                                                                (4.11)  Dimensionless time:   2ABD tR                                                                                    (4.12) 52      Dimensionless radial coordinate:  rR                                                                     (4.13) ls PVBV K                                                                                                                      (4.14)  ABDkRN2                                                                                                                       (4.15)                                                                                                                   (4.16)                                                                                                                             Equations (4.1)-(4.3) in dimensionless form are given by:   3222 2sN                                                                                 (4.17)  Provided that the particles are of the same size initially and retain their shape during the dissolution process the surface area of the undissolved drug is proportional to the volume. Hence  s  power 2/3 [47].

However by making some approximations a semi analytical solution can be obtained. It is beneficial to get an approximate solution as the drug concentration profiles obtained from both the numerical and approximate solutions can be compared. This will help us in gauging the accuracy of the numerical solution. Equations (4.18) and (4.19) which have the non linear term have to be linearized using making some approximations. The approach followed is very similar to that of Frenning‟s [47]. However, it should be noted that in his work Frenning neither considered the accumulation of the drug nor the effect of absorption rate. His model was developed for perfect sink conditions and the Equations for obtaining Eigen values were much simpler than the problem described in section. An approximate solution can be obtained by considering only the initial stages of drug release.  The following approximation can be made during early stages of drug release [47]. 1 SU                                                                                                                         (4.25)  From the initial condition of Equations (4.1) and (4.2) it can be concluded that both    and U are equal to zero initially.

By changing the parameter values (in Equation (4.72)) effect of absorption rate, dissolution rate and solubility on rate of drug released can be analyzed. The corresponding Eigen values can be computed using Equation (4.70). Equation (4.35) gives the relation between s  and  , for every n value we get two values for ns one positive and one negative. Both the values were incorporated into Equation (4.72) for computing the fraction of drug released. The drug release profiles are computed and discussed in chapter 8. The semi analytical results are also compared with the numerical results. 61  CHAPTER 5  MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF DRUG RELEASE FROM SPHERICAL MATRIX SYSTEMS: ANALYSIS OF THE AFFECT OF DIFFUSION RATE AND ABSORPTION RATE ON RATE OF DRUG RELEASE   5.1 Introduction  The dissolution term in Equation (4.1) is only valid as long as there is solid drug present. When the concentration of the dispersed drug within the matrix is very small an assumption of instantaneous dissolution can be made. So the second term in the Equation (4.1) is dropped and only the diffusion term is considered. Now the problem at hand becomes drug release from a diffusion controlled drug delivery system.   5.2 Problem statement  Consider an encapsulated drug in a polymer matrix system. When administered orally the drug reaches the GI tract where it is released and eventually absorbed. Following absorption in the GI tract the drug enters the plasma compartment. The rate of absorption depends on various factors such as the amount of food present in the stomach, type of food taken, pH etc., [11]. This situation can be interpreted as an encapsulated drug matrix system of radius R  and volume sV   placed in a liquid compartment of finite volume lV  .The concentration of the drug is C . The drug enters the liquid phase by the process of mass diffusion at timet 0= . The concentration of the drug in the liquid phase is taken aslC . A well- stirred tank assumption is made such that lC  is independent of position. Thereby the drug is consumed by a first order absorption (Figure 4.2).        Absorption rate (rk  )                                       Figure 5.1 Schematic representation of drug release from diffusion controlled drug delivery System in the GI Tract.                                             Assumptions  1. A matrix type of a system is considered wherein the drug particles are encapsulated within a polymer matrix. The liquid from the compartment enters the polymer matrix, dissolving the drug within the matrix instantaneously thus enabling it to release. 2. The process of drug release from the spherical matrix into the finite reservoir (simulating the GI tract) is assumed to be controlled by diffusion. 3. The drug releases from the polymer matrix into the GI tract. Only absorption of the drug in the GI tract is considered and the transport of the drug into the plasma compartment is not considered. Thus the effect of absorption rate on the rate of drug release in the GI tract is the only consideration. 4. The radius of the drug particles is assumed to remain constant during the release process and in this model is appropriate for small particles (micro and nano). 5. The drug is assumed to release with a constant diffusivity. 6. Initially there is no drug present in the compartment.

All the parameter values such as diffusion coefficient, volume of drug, radius of the spherical drug particles, are taken for lidocaine release from PLGA biodegradable spherical particles Polakovic et.al. [50] .The Eigenvalues given by equation (5.43) were determined using the FindRoot function in Mathematica® (Wolfram, 1996). The parameter M accounts for the effect of the absorption constant. 69             Gorner et.al, [78] studied the lidocaine release from small nanosized drug particles with low percentages of drug loadings. The authors reported that no biodegradation of the polymer occurred over the observed period of time. The drug release was monitored over a period of 4 days. To benchmark our model, the model predicted drug release profiles were compared with the experimental data (provided by Prof. Polakovic).          Figures 5.2 and 5.3 compare the drug release profiles between the in vitro experimental data, diffusion only model and the proposed model; for 6.5 % (w/w) and 8.5 % (w/w) lidocaine loaded nanospheres. From Figure 5.2, one can observe that the diffusion model over predicts the experimental release profile by about 25%; while the largest difference between the proposed model and the experimental data occurs much later in the release and is under predicting the profile there by about 14%.

Figure 5.3 Drug release for a loading of 8.4 % (w/w).    Though, it is stated in the literature that the absorption and distribution of lidocaine is relatively fast [79] there are various factors that can affect the absorption kinetics. Although oral delivery is not the most popular method for lidocaine admission there are a few studies in the literature for oral absorption of lidocaine [80]. Adjepon-Yamoah, K. K., et al. [81], studies the effect of presence of atropine in the system on the absorption rate of orally administered lidocaine while Isohanni N.H., et al. [82] studied the effect of fluvoxamine and erythromycin on the pharmacokinetics of orally administered lidocaine. Therefore it is sufficient to consider the effect of different absorption rates on the lidocaine release rate. Since the drug dissolution is assumed to be very quick 00.050.10.150.20.250.30.350 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000Time(min)Fraction. of drug releasedExpt.DiffusionModel71     (instantaneous) therefore when absorption rate is very slow it becomes the rate controlling step. Three values of absorption rate constants were considered one high (2k) value, a medium value ((k) which is about 1h-1 [79])and a low value (k/2) to see its affect on drug release (Figures 5.4 and 5.5).  In Figure 5.4 the solid line represents the calculated fraction of drug release taking into account an arbitrary value of the absorption rate constant, the dashed line represents the diffusion only model and the diamond dots represent the a doubling of the arbitrary kr value. It can be seen from Figure 5.4 that for fast absorption rate there is virtually no difference between a diffusion only model and a model taking into account the absorption rate constant.      Figure 5.4 Drug Release for Fast Absorption Rate.   00.050.10.150.20.250.30.350.40 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000Time (min)Fraction releasedkDiffusion2k72     In Figure 5.5 the solid line represents the calculated value of drug release taking into account an  arbitrary (same as in Figure 5.4) value of absorption rate constant, and the diamond dots represent a halving of the arbitrary kr value. It appears that when the absorption rate is slowed to half of the comparative standard, the drug release profile is markedly different from that exhibited by the diffusion only model. This suggests that during the mass transfer of the drug into the GI tract, the overall rate of mass transfer is sensitive to the rate of absorption of the drug in the GI tract. Specifically, if the absorption rate is relatively fast then its effect on the overall rate of mass transfer is negligible. However if the absorption rate is relatively slow the overall rate of mass transfer to the GI tract will be significantly reduced.

There is significant difference between the release profiles calculated using a diffusion only model and a diffusion model accounting for the effect of absorption. Therefore the rate of absorption plays an important role in the drug release process. Although many of the mathematical models take into account the perfect sink condition, in a real system this assumption may not be true as there are many physiological parameters which may affect the drug delivery process. To establish a good in vitro and in vivo drug release correlation, mathematical models will need to incorporate more parameters. This study does establish a significant step in the kinetics of drug delivery by including absorption in the delivery pathway of an oral drug dosage.    74  74  CHAPTER 6 ASYMPTOTIC SOLUTION: ANALYSIS OF THE AFFECT OF ABSORPTION RATE AND DISSOLUTION RATE ON RATE OF DRUG RELEASED   6.1 Problem Description The problem description is similar to the one in section 4.1. However, now Equations (4.1)-(4.3) are taken to be time dependent and independent of position (which neglects diffusion). Therefore now we have a set of ordinary differential equations represented by Equations (6.1) through (6.7). This solution is termed as asymptotic solution as we make some limiting approximations. This type of analysis is useful for tablet formulations of BCS class II compounds [1], where diffusion of drug is very fast in comparison with the dissolution of the drug. Therefore the diffusion term is removed from Equation (4.1). The drug release process is now completely dissolution controlled. The surface boundary condition (Equation (4.3)) is now recast in a different form (Equation (6.3)) which is a simple mass balance of drug across the particle and bulk liquid. The solution method is very similar to that carried out in the previous chapters. Equation (6.1) through (6.7) is also solved numerically using the MATLAB programming. The result for the asymptotic solution solved analytically is only valid for certain time range short times in other words. Whereas the numerical solution describes the drug release process over all time periods. However this analysis is only valid as long as dissolution is controlling the drug release process and diffusion is very fast.    75  75  6.2 Solution Method                                                                                                                                                                                                       (6.1)                                CCSSSkdtdSs  3/200                                                                                      (6.2)  lallls CkVdtdCVdtdCV                                                                                          (6.3)  The Boundary and Initial conditions are given by (6.4) 0)0,( rC                        0)0( lC   (6.5)                                                                                                                                                                                 (6.6)    lKCC      at          Rr    (6.7)  The dimensionless parameters used are:  Dimensionless concentration of dissolved drug osSCS  0                                         6.8)                                                  Dimensionless concentration of dissolved drug present in the liquid compartment                                                    oPllSKCS  0                                                             (6.9) Dimensionless solubility:   oSSCS  0                                                                      (6.10)     Dimensionless time:   2ABD tR                                                                                     (6.11) Dimensionless radial coordinate:  rR                                                                      (6.12) ls PVBV K                                                                                                                      (6.13)  CCSSSkdtdCs  3/2000)0( SS 76  76  ABDkRN2                                                                                                                       (6.14)                                                                                                                   (6.15)                                                                                                                Problem recast in non dimensional form:     3/2sNdd                                                                                                   (6.16)    3/2ss Ndd                                                                                               (6.17) MMdtdddBll 1                                                                                       (6.18) The boundary and initial conditions become  ( ,0) 0                                                                                                                        (6.19)  1)0,(  s                                                                                                                     (6.20)  (0) 0l                                                                                                                          (6.21)  Following section 4.3 the following assumption is made for obtaining an approximate solution.

By changing the value of M in Equation (6.49) the fraction of drug released is obtained for different rates of absorption. The value for B and N are kept constant and the values of M are varied. Similarly the effect of dissolution rate N can be analyzed by keeping B and M constant. All the parameter values are taken from Polakovic‟s article [50] the solubility of drug is taken to be 0.5 [47].  Figure 6.1 Affect of absorption rate on rate of drug release for initial period of release.  Figure 6.1 shows the effect of absorption rate on rate of drug released during initial period, which is up to 800 minutes of release time. As it can be seen there is not much difference in the release rates or fraction of drug released for three different absorption rate values.  81  81   Figure 6.2 Comparison of asymptotic and numerical solutions.  Figure 6.2 shows the effect of absorption rate for a time period beyond 3000 minutes. The effect of absorption rate is now evident. The fraction of drug released out of a dissolution controlled dosage form is substantially low at a higher absorption rate. The fraction of drug released reaches a maximum peak at about 0.06 when the rate of absorption is low. The plot also sheds light on when the drug release process stops thus providing valuable information on when the next dosage form needs to be administered. The plot also shows that there is a good agreement between the asymptotic and numerical predictions. The agreement reduces beyond time period of 0.12. As the solubility limit is placed at 50% the fraction of drug released is very low. 82  82  CHAPTER 7 ANALYTICAL SOLUTION:  ANALYSIS OF THE AFFECT OF DISSOLUTION RATE AND ABSORPTION RATE ON RATE OF DRUG RELEASE    7.1 Problem Description Polakovic et al. [50] developed a simple model to describe the drug release process form a dissolution controlled drug delivery system. The change in concentration of the solid drug with respect to time is equal to the dissolution coefficient times the difference in solid and bulk liquid concentration. Diffusion of the dissolved drug out of the dosage form is considered to be very fast when compared to the dissolution of the drug. Therefore the Equation (7.1) only takes into account the dissolution of drug. The drug delivery system is similar to the one described in section 4.1 and 5.1. A uniformly distributed matrix system is considered. The concentration of solid drug is taken to be a function of time only. When administered orally the drug reaches the GI tract where it is released and eventually absorbed. This situation can be described mathematically by Equations (7.1) through (7.5) where R  is the radius of the spherical particle,  sV  the volume of the solid particles lV   the volume of liquid compartment and S  is the concentration of solid drug. The drug enters the liquid phase by process of diffusion at timet 0= . The concentration of the drug in the liquid phase is taken as lC . A well- stirred tank assumption is made such that lC  is  83  83  independent of position. Thereby the drug is consumed by a first order absorption (Figure 4.1).  7.2 Solution Method   lPCKSkdtdS

All the parameter values are taken from Polakovic‟s article [50]. The particles are up to 400 nanometers and have a drug loading of 20% (w/w) therefore the dissolution of drug within the polymer matrix becomes the rate controlling step. Plots are made for fraction of drug release (Equation (7.35) versus square root of time ( ). By changing the value of M in Equation (7.35) the fraction of drug released is obtained for different rates of absorption. The value for B and N are kept constant and the values of M are varied.  87  87   Figure 7.1 Affect of absorption rate on rate of drug release for initial period of release.  The effect of absorption rate on rate of drug released during initial period of release is shown in figure 7.1. The time period of release is up to 800 minutes. As it can be seen there is not much difference in the release rates or fraction of drug released for three different absorption rate values.  Figure 7.2 Affect of absorption rate on rate of drug release.  88  88  Figure 7.2 shows the effect of absorption rate for a time period beyond 3000 minutes. The effect of absorption rate is now evident. The fraction of drug released out of a dissolution controlled dosage form is substantially low at a higher absorption rate. The fraction of drug released reaches a maximum peak at about 0.2 when the rate of absorption is low. The plot also gives information on when the drug release process stops thus providing valuable information on when the next dosage form needs to be administered.  Figure 7.3 Comparison of drug release profiles for nonlinear and liner dissolution models for initial release period.  Figure 7.3 gives a comparison of drug release profiles obtained from asymptotic solution (chapter 6) and linear dissolution model. For both the models the effect of absorption rate on rate of drug released is less significant for the initial phase of release. However the nonlinear dissolution model captures the delay in release well than the linear dissolution model. Also the predicted rate of release is slightly higher for the linear dissolution model than the nonlinear model. 89  89   Figure 7.4 Comparison of drug release profiles (asymptotic solution and linear dissolution model) for entire time period.  Figure 7.4 shows the release profiles predicted by both the models over the entire time period. For both the models the rate of drug release is higher when absorption rate is lower. However the fraction of drug released is significantly higher when nonlinear dissolution is not considered. As solubility limit of 50% is taken in the asymptotic solution this imposes a limit on the fraction of drug released into liquid. The models should be applied based on the type of dosage forms used. For a tablet or compact which has mostly API powder the chance of solubility being low is high especially if it‟s a BCS class II drug. For controlled release dosage form with drug particles encapsulated in a polymer matrix the solubility is significantly higher or improved yet dissolution can be slow enough to control the drug release process.90  90  CHAPTER 8 NUMERICAL SOLUTION  8.1 Introduction  Since the problem discussed in section 4.1 is a non linear problem, it has to be solved using numerical methods. MATLAB program is implemented to get the numerical solution. The equations are discretized using the finite difference numerical method of lines scheme and the resulting system of ODEs is solved using one of MATLAB‟s built in solver.

The resulting system of ODEs in the initial value variables (typically time) is then integrated by an initial value ODE (ordinary differential equation) integrator (eg. Euler method, Modified Euler method, RKF 45). MOL has several advantages a few of them are listed below:  The temporal and spatial integrations are separated in the sense that they can be treated separately in the coding; this adds a very attractive degree of flexibility. Library routines can be used for the temporal and spatial integrations.  All major classes of PDEs (partial differential equations) can be accommodated (elliptical, hyperbolic and parabolic) 94  94   Systems of ODEs and PDEs (in one, two and three spatial dimensions plus time), linear and nonlinear can be naturally accommodated within the MOL; for example ODEs can serve as boundary conditions for PDEs. However  application of MOL with even two spatial dimensions is extremely computationally expensive, and with 3D even more so.  8.4 MATLAB Program The discretized equations are solved using MATLAB programming. ODE15S integrator was used to solve the problem. The MATLAB code and discretization of Equations is given in Appendix A and Appendix B.  8.5 Results and Discussions Figure 8.1 shows the drug release profiles for different absorption rates generated using the MATLAB code. The trend is very similar to that observed in the chapters 6 and 7. As the absorption rate is high the rate of drug released is low. The drug release curve shows a slight delay in release during initial time due to the non linear dissolution term, thus capturing the phenomena explained by Frenning [47]. Figure 8.2 compares the drug release profiles for different absorption rates (low to high) and also the case with no absorption. The drug release is maximum for the case with no absorption considered. As the rate of removal of drug from the liquid compartment is 0 the amount or fraction of drug in the liquid is maximum. As the rate of removal of drug increases the amount accumulated in the liquid compartment decreases and also it reaches a very small peak.   95  95        Figure 8.1 Comparison of drug release profiles for different absorption rates   Figure 8.2 Comparison of drug release profiles with and without absorption. 96  96   Figure 8.3 Comparison of semi analytical and numerical results  The analytical (chapter 4) and the numerical results for high and low absorption rates are compared in figure 8.3. During intial time at about a time scale of 0.015 in the above figure the effect of absorption rate is negligible. The numerical results agree well with the analytical values only up to a time scale of 0.03. However after this time period the semi analytical solution blows up, and cannot be considered for explaining the drug release behavior. These findings are coherent with those of Frenning‟s [47].  97  97   Figure 8.4 Comparison of semi analytical, asymptotic, numerical and linear dissolution model  Finally the drug release profiles computed using all the four models discussed in chapters 4, 6, 7 and 8 are plotted in figure 8.4. The time period (square root of tau) of 0.04 in the figure makes up to more than 5000 minutes of drug release time [50]. In their article Polakovic et.al. reported release from a controlled release drug delivery system for up to 3 days. During this period they found that the drug reached a peak value of approximately 2.5 (fraction of drug released) and stayed at that value for a time period of 3 days. From figure it can be seen that the asymptotic solution and the linear dissolution model predict a much higher and faster release than the semi analytical solution and the numerical solution (considering both diffusion and dissolution). The value of absorption rate was fixed at M=1500 for all the models. Therefore it is advisable to apply the diffusion-dissolution model (chapter 4 and 8) when the drug release period is very large ranging from weeks to months.  98  CHAPTER 9 CONCLUSIONS  The objective of the work was to present mathematical models for prediction of drug release in the GI tract. The models took into account the absorption rate of drug through the intestine wall along with the physiochemical properties of drug like solubility, diffusion and dissolution rate. Five models were presented in this work. These models mainly targeted three types of drug delivery systems, first model which took into account both diffusion and dissolution (Chapter 4), second model was for purely diffusion controlled dosage forms (Chapter 5) and the third model was for purely dissolution controlled drug delivery systems (Chapter 6 and 7).  It was observed that absorption rate of a drug has significant impact on the rate of drug released. For diffusion controlled delivery forms as the rate of absorption increased the prediction of drug released came closer to the values predicted by pure diffusion model. However for dissolution controlled drug delivery devices the rate of absorption had a different effect. The fraction of drug was higher for low values of absorption rate. Therefore it is evident that when absorption rate is not included in the modeling process it can lead to significant errors in prediction of drug released. It can either over predict or under predict the rate of drug release. However, it is very important to know where to apply the model. For small times or during initial time period of release the impact of absorption rate is very less on the rate of drug released. So for immediate dosage forms or for drug delivery systems where the period of drug release is very small the prediction of drug released with and without99    inclusion of absorption rate does not differ significantly. For oral dosage form containing BCS class II compounds (tablets, compacts of API powders etc…) dissolution of the drug becomes the main rate controlling step. In such cases the models presented in Chapter 6 and 7 which take diffusion to be much faster than dissolution and therefore a non contributing factor in drug release process should be considered. However, for a controlled release dosage form where the drug release process is expected to proceed for days, weeks or even months both diffusion and dissolution play a major role and the models presented in chapter 4 and 8 can be correctly applied to predict drug release. And for cases where the drug loading is low or where the drug dissolution is fast (BCS class I compounds) diffusion becomes the rate controlling step and model presented in Chapter 5 can be applied.   Most of the models in literature take into account only the dissolution kinetics of the dosage form, and pharmacokinetic modeling is applied only for dissolution controlled delivery systems [68]. However most of the dosage forms being developed in recent times aim at improving the solubility and dissolution kinetics of dosage forms and the drug diffusion through the polymer matrix plays a major role in drug delivery process. Thus the model developed in this work throws light at how such a dosage system would be behave at different absorption rates.    100  CHAPTER 10 FUTURE STUDIES   1. Modeling of Drug Release from Rectangular and Cylindrical matrix systems  One of the objectives of the future studies will be to expand or extend the models developed in this work to non spherical matrix systems. Drug delivery systems in cylindrical matrices (e.g. needle shaped etc.) are common in literature and depending on application are preferred over spherical matrix systems. Similarly polymer films containing drug (e.g. transdermal patch or buccal, muccoadhesive strips) also have a wide range of application. Mathematical modeling of drug release from such systems has been studied widely in literature. However, the affect of absorption rate, diffusion rate and dissolution rate on these matrix types has not yet been explored. It will also be interesting to see how the geometry in conjunction with physiological and physiochemical parameters affects the drug release process.  2. Drug Release from Thin Film Drug Delivery Systems (ERC related work)  Future studies will also focus on attempting to apply the developed models to experimental data for drug release from polymer films or polymer thin film strips.  As mentioned previously polymer thin films have a wide range of applications and depending on the type of polymer used, the drug release mechanism can be manipulated, the diffusion rate can be controlled etc. In the ERC- NSF funded project at NJIT efforts are currently being made for development of polymer thin films containing dispersed BCS class II drug nano particle. By varying the thickness of the film the drug loading and polymer content vary and thus the release mechanism can also vary. As the drug 101   compounds have low solubility, dissolution might also become a rate controlling mechanism depending on the drug loading of the system.   3. Analysis of Results Further analysis has to be done for the results obtained in Chapters 4 through 8. The effect of each parameter value (B, M and N) on the drug release behavior is to be investigated in depth. It is also of interest to compare the drug release behavior for sink and non sink conditions (with and without inclusion of absorption rate). Finally, it is a common notion to represent drug release profiles as a ratio of MM t . All the results obtained in this work have been represented as a ratio of drug released to initial drug present within the system. These results have to be recast in terms of the mass ratio.            102   APPENDIX A Numerical Methods   For i=1  )(223 13/2112121 uwdxuudtdub                   )( 13/2111 uwdtdwb               For  i=2  to  i =N-1  )(222 3/2111211ibiiiiiiii uwxuuxxuuudtdu   )(3/211 ibi uwdtdw   For  i = N  NNNnn vxuuuBdtdv2212433    )(3/21 NbNN uwdtdw   103  APPENDIX B  MATLAB Code   clear clc clear all %-------------------Constants------------------------------------ phi2 = 5.205152486; %M phi1 = 9.93E-01;  %N B = 0.30922449; thb = .2; %Theta B %----------------------------------------------------------------- N = 321; %Number of nodes   dx=1/(N-1); %Step size   u0 = zeros(2*N+1,1); %Initial Condition at t=0 for u    %Initial Condition at t=0 for w for i=(N+2):(2*N+1)     u0(i)=1; end   global x %Array of x values for i=1:N     x(i) = (i-1)*dx; end   options = odeset('RelTol',1e-6,'AbsTol',1e-6); %Error tolerance   tstep = (0:.0001:.02); %Time step   %Calls ODE Solver [t,u] = ode15s(@ode_uvw,tstep,u0,options,dx,N,B,phi2,phi1,thb);   %Extracts V from u matrix V1 = u(1:end,N);   %Extracts U from u matrix U1 = u(1:end,1:N);   plot(t(1:end),V1(1:end,1)) title(['Concentration of Dissolved Drug outside Sphere w/ step size of ',num2str(dx)]); ylabel('V(tao)') xlabel('tao') legend(['B = ',num2str(B),', phi1 = ',num2str(phi1),', phi2=',num2str(phi2)])   104    function dt=ode_uvw(t,u,dx,N,B,phi2,phi1,thb)   global x %Array of x values   dt = zeros(2*N+1,1); %Initiates Size of dt   %In matrix, u is represented from i=1 to i=N %w is represented from i = N+2 to i = 2N +1   %Solves for u when i=1 dt(1) = 3*((2*u(2)-2*u(1))/(dx^2))+((phi1)*((u(N+2))^(2/3))*(thb-u(1)));   %Solves for w when i=1 dt(N+2) = ((-phi1)*((u(N+2))^(2/3)))*(thb-u(1));      %Solves for inner nodes of u and w for i=2:N-1     %u(i) Equation:     dt(i) = ((u(i-1)-2*u(i)+u(i+1))/(dx^2))+((2/x(i))*((u(i+1)-u(i-1))/(2*dx)))+(phi1*((u(N+1+i))^(2/3))*(thb-u(i)));          %w(i) Equation:     dt(N+1+i) = (-phi1*((u(N+1+i))^(2/3))*(thb-u(i)));     end   %Solves for u/v when i=N dt(N) = (-phi2)*(u(N))-(3/B)*((3*u(N)-4*u(N-1)+u(N-2))/(2*dx));   %Solves for W when i=N dt(2*N+1) = (-phi1*((u(2*N+1))^(2/3))*(thb-u(N)));   105  REFERENCES  1.

In a game-theoretic setting, where two producers choose their investment expenditure before simultaneously setting the release date of their good, we prove that two equilibria are possible: Releases are either simultaneous (at the demand peak) or staggered (one producer delays). In the latter equilibrium, the first-mover secures its position by investing more in attractiveness. We test this prediction on a dataset of more than 1500 American movies released in 10 countries over 12 years. Results are consistent with the theoretical predictions, indicating that higher budget movies are released closer to seasonal demand peaks",,info:eu-repo/semantics/article,"Management of Technology and Innovation, Strategy and Management, Economics and Econometrics, General Business, Management and Accounting",,'Wiley'

The Enemy Release Hypothesis (ERH)(Williamson, 1996) forms an important explanation for the success of non-native species:they suffer less from natural enemies (predators, parasites and herbivores) than nativespecies for twomain reasons: (1) non-native speciesmay have been introducedwithout theirHow to cite this article Meijer et al. (2016), A review and meta-analysis of the enemy release hypothesis in plant–herbivorous insect sys-tems. PeerJ 4:e2778; DOI 10.7717/peerj.2778natural enemies, and (2) potential enemies may not yet have colonized and/or adapted tothe novel species. These predictions from the ERH have been tested many times in bothanimals and plants, using either the community approach (studying native and non-nativespecies in the same habitat or community) or the biogeographical approach (studyingthe same species in their native and introduced habitat). However, the outcomes of thesestudies are highly variable (Keane & Crawley, 2002; Jeschke et al., 2012) and sometimes evencontradicting each other. For instance, Colautti et al. (2004) showed that most of the re-viewed studies (15 out of 25) found support for the ERH,while six foundno support and fivefound results opposite to the prediction of the ERH (one study found both support for andagainst the ERH). They therefore conclude that there is no simple relationship betweenenemy release and the success of non-native species.Possibly, the contradictory results are due to the large variety of study systems incor-porated. If so, one would expect less variability when focussing on a more specific system.Indeed, two reviews with such a narrower focus provided more robust results with generalsupport for the ERH. Torchin et al. (2003) reviewed the parasite load of 26 animal hostspecies (including molluscs, crustaceans, fishes, birds, mammals, amphibians and reptiles),using the biogeographical approach, and found twice asmany parasite species on animals intheir native habitat, compared to the introduced habitat. Liu & Stiling (2006) reviewed ERHstudies in plant–herbivore insect systems and similarly found clear support for the ERH.However, these latter results should be interpreted with care for two reasons. First, the stud-ies reviewed only investigated a limited number of plant species. Second, data for this reviewwere obtained using very different methods (ranging from limited anecdotal observationsto many years of field data). Hence, for a proper review of the ERH one would best focus onstudies of a specific system, which apply comparable study approaches and methodologies,and with sufficiently large numbers of species studied.We performed a review of the ERH using one type of study system, namely plants andtheir insect herbivores.We compiled a large number (68) of datasets that use the communityor biogeographic approach, incorporating in total more than 700 plant species. With thisdataset we performed ameta-analysis for both approaches to test the predictions of the ERHthat the insect diversity, insect load and level of herbivory are higher on native host plants(or in native habitats) than on non-native host plants (or in non-native habitats).MATERIALS AND METHODSData collectionThe two main methods used to study the effect of the ERH—the community approach andthe biogeographical approach—each have their benefits and disadvantages. The benefit ofthe community approach (studying different native and non-native species in the samecommunity) is that all species are studied within the same environment. However, the dis-advantage is that taxonomically very different plant species are compared, often even fromdifferent families. Since the diversity and numbers of herbivorous insects (hereafter insects)between plant taxamay vary greatly (Agrawal & Kotanen, 2003), the choice of plants studiedcan greatly influence the outcome of study. Probably the best way to use the communityMeijer et al. (2016), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.2778 2/15approach is to compare native and introduced species from the same genus, as somestudies have done (Auerbach & Simberloff, 1988; Kennedy & Southwood, 1984; Leather,1986; Proches et al., 2008; Sugiura, 2010), or to encompass a substantial representation of aregion’s entire flora. With the biogeographical approach (comparing the same plant speciesin both native and novel habitat) this problem of using taxonomic different plant species isavoided, but the community in which the species are studied may be very different. Fromhere onwards, when considering the biogeographical approach, wewill refer to native speciesfor species growing in their native area and to non-native species for species growing in theirintroduced area. In line with the reviewed papers, we here use a rather broad definition ofsuccess of non-native species that includes species that successfully establish and (rapidly)expand in the novel environment, often—but not necessarily—becoming pest species(i.e., resulting in large negative economic or ecological impact (sensu Williamson, 1996)).We searched Web of Science for relevant studies using single or a combination of thefollowing keywords: native, non-native, insect, plant, introduced, non-indigenous, exotic,invasive. Furthermore, we used cross-referencing to find additional articles referring tothese retrieved studies. In total, we found 68 datasets in 44 articles published between 1974and 2015, studying one of the following variables: number of insect species (measure ofdiversity, 33 datasets, Table 1), number of insect individuals (measure of insect load, 18datasets, Table 2) and level of herbivory—predominantly scored as number/percentage ofleaves with herbivore damage (including leaf mining), percentage herbivore damage perleaf, or differences in leaf biomass (17 datasets, Table 3). For all datasets, the means andstandard deviations of the above-mentioned variables were taken (if only standard errorwas given, standard deviation was calculated based on standard error and sample size), aswell as the number of plant species for native and non-native plant species. We excludedeight datasets from the analyses on the number of insect species (Clement, 1990; Jobin,Schaffner & Nentwig, 1996; Johnson, Mccaffrey & Merickel, 1992; Lindelöw & Björkman,2001; Moran, 1980; Morrow & Lamarche, 1978; Strong, Lawton & Southwood, 1984; Tewks-bury et al., 2002;Waloff, 1966), as in these eight studies the data collection of the insects onnative plants was done during a different study and/or using a different method than thedata collection of the insects on non-native plants. One of the datasets (Table 2, dataset 42)was collected by one of the authors (KM) in 2009 and is here reported for the first time(K Meijer, 2009, unpublished data). Native and non-native plant species were sampled forherbivore insects in three nature areas in the North of the Netherlands that are quite similarin tree species composition and land-use history, and within a 15 km radius (NoordlaarderBos 53.117◦N, 6.644◦E; Vosbergen 53.141◦N, 6.583◦E; Mensingebos 53.123◦N, 6.436◦E).Eight native plants (Betula pendula, Frangulus alnus, Lonicera periclymenum, Populus alba,Prunus avium, Prunus padus, Quercus robur, Sorbus aucuparia) and four non-native plantspecies (Amelanchier spec., Prunus serotina, Quercus rubra, Robinia pseudoacacia) weresampled. To standardize data collection, we selected low hanging branches (up till 2 mhigh) of at least 1 m long that were shaken for 10 s above a 1 m2 sheet, and counted thenumber of herbivore insects in the sheet. All other collected functional groups such aspredatory or omnivorous insects were discarded. Samples were taken on average 8.25 timesper plant species.Meijer et al.

For each dataset the standardizedmean difference and 95%confidence interval were calculated, and for each group of datasets the overall standardizedmean differences and 95% confidence interval was calculated and tested (Tables 1–3). Wereport the results for the number of insect species, number of insect individuals and levelof herbivory for each approach separately (community and biogeographical approach).RESULTSNumber of insect speciesCommunity approachIn total 22 datasets (261 native and 168 non-native plant species) were found that usedthe community approach to study differences between native and non-native plants inthe number of insect species. Most studies (19) found more insect species on native thanon non-native plant species, two found the opposite, and one found no differences. Sixof the datasets consisted of only one native and/or only one non-native plant species.These datasets could not be included in the meta-analysis. The analysis of the remaining 16datasets (256 native and 162 non-native plant species) showed significantly higher numbersMeijer et al. (2016), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.2778 6/15of insect species on native than on non-native plant species (z = 6.16, P < 0.001, Table 1,Fig. 1A).Biogeographical approachEleven datasets (25 plant species) were found using the biogeographical approach tostudy differences between plants growing in their native and non-native range. All of thesedatasets showed higher numbers of insect species in the native than in the non-native range,but all consisted of low numbers of plant species studied. Seven datasets studied only oneplant species, the other four datasets studied two species (3 datasets) and 12 (one dataset).These last four datasets (containing more than one plant species) were used for themeta-analysis, which showed a non-significant trend that plants growing in their nativerange containedmore insect species than when growing in their non-native range (z = 1.75,P = 0.08, Table 1, Fig. 1A).Number of insect individualsCommunity approachFourteen datasets (94 native and 101 non-native plant species) used the community ap-proach to study the differences in the number of insect individuals between native and non-native plant species. Ten datasets showed higher numbers of insects on native than on non-native plants, four the opposite. Ten of the datasets (90 native and 95 non-native species)consisted of enough plant species to be used for the meta-analysis, which showed nosignificant differences in the number of insect individuals between native and non-nativeplant species (z =−1.44, P = 0.15, Table 2, Fig. 1B).Biogeographical approachFour datasets (29 plant species) were found that used the biogeographical approach to studythe differences in the number of insect individuals between plants growing in their nativeand non-native range. Three datasets showed higher numbers of insect individuals on plantsgrowing in their native than their introduced range, one dataset showed the opposite result.Overall, the numbers of insect individuals was significantly higher on plants growing intheir native than their introduced range (z = 2.14, P = 0.03, Table 2, Fig. 1B).Level of herbivoryCommunity approachThirteen datasets (102 native and 104 non-native plant species) were found that used thecommunity approach to study the differences in the level of herbivory between native andnon-native plant species. Ten datasets found higher levels of herbivory on native than onnon-native plant species, three datasets found the opposite. Eight of these datasets (96 nativeand 99 non-native species) could be used for the meta-analysis, showing no significantdifference in the level of herbivory between native and non-native plant species (z = 0.996,p= 0.32, Table 3, Fig. 1C).Biogeographical approachFour datasets were found that used the biogeographical approach to study the differences inthe level of herbivory between plants growing in their native and their non-native range.

(2016), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.2778 8/15four datasets showed higher levels of herbivory when plants were growing in their nativerange. Unfortunately, all four datasets consisted of only one plant species studied, andtherefore it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis on these datasets.DISCUSSIONRegardless of the applied approach (community or biogeographical), the results of thismeta-analysis indicate that native plants contain more insect species than non-native plantspecies do. Results for insect load and level of herbivory point in the same direction, butdifferences between native and non-native plants were only marginal or not significant,depending on the applied approach (community or biogeographical approach). Hence, ourresults are relatively consistent and, at least partly, in line with the predictions of the ERH.The narrower focus on a specific study system—here: plants and their herbivorous insects—may have helped to reduce the variability and contradictory results that others previouslyencountered (e.g., Colautti et al., 2004).Our finding that non-native plants contained fewer herbivorous insect species thannativeplants can best be explained by the high level of specialization of themajority of herbivorousinsects. Most herbivorous insects are extreme specialists, adapted to feeding on only oneplant genus (monophage) or one plant species (strict monophage) (Thompson, 1994).Even the more generalist species often consist of locally specialized populations, races oreven sibling species, e.g., the ermine moth (Lepidoptera) Yponomeuta padellus L. complexfeeding on a various Rosaceae species (Menken, 1996). Most species of phytophagousinsects appear to have speciated due to sequential evolution (Miller & Wenzel, 1995).Our results show that both insect load and herbivory levels on non-native plants arenot—or only marginally—different from those on native plants. In fact, it may be veryadvantageous for herbivorous insects, even monophages, to shift hosts from native tonon-native plants as this novel environment is relatively free of competitors. Indeed, hostshifts from native to non-native plants by specialist herbivorous insects have been reported.The most famous example is the host shift by the apple maggot fly Rhagoletis pomonellaWalsh (Diptera: Tephritidae) from the native hawthorn (Crataegus spp.) to apple (Malussylvestris) after the introduction of apple into North America some 400 years ago (Bush,1969; McPheron, Smith & Berlocher, 1988). A more recent example is the host shift by theleaf beetle Gonioctena quinquepunctata from native Sorbus aucuparia to Prunus serotina inWestern-Europe, leading to (weak) host-specific differentiation in the beetle populations(Schilthuizen et al., 2016). With the increasing number of established non-native plants itis to be expected that other native herbivorous insects will follow over time.With time since arrival in a novel environment also the number of insect species pernon-native plant is expected to increase. Shortly after arrival, only very few insect specieswill be able to shift host plant, resulting in lower numbers of insect species and/or a lowerinsect load (number of insects) feeding on non-native plants. However, over time, thesenumbers may increase, as evidenced by the study of Brändle et al. (2008). Although wewere not able to take into account the time since arrival of non-native plants in this study,it would be very interesting to study how this affects the outcome of such a meta-analysis.Meijer et al. (2016), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.2778 9/15Almost all studies we reviewed used a ‘one-way’ approach: studies using the communityapproach that compared native and non-native plants in one habitat—but not reciprocally,and studies using the biogeographical approach that compared plants in their native andnon-native habitat, but—again—not in a reciprocal way. Using only one of the one-way ap-proaches is likely to result in either over- or underestimation of the differences between na-tive and non-native plants (Meijer et al., 2015). Using both approaches simultaneously in areciprocal way is arguably the best method for testing the predictions from the ERH, butdespite the numerous studies performed on the ERH, very few studies have so far appliedthis method.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSWe would like to thank Anurag Agrawal and Marion E.

A protection system can be implemented as a filter governing the access to assets. Typically we will have a chain of attacks and countermeasures concerning this access to the desired assets. We model this process as an arms race. We base our model on a process model of a protection system based on exposure time. A user&apos;s reaction against an exploiter measure could either be a direct response to the measure or an attempt to anticipate future attacks by more general means of defeating the protection of the exploiter agent. When anticipating future attacks and countermeasures, both users and exploiters will improve their methods and tools due to an arms race. Our arms race model refines the competition as modeled in computational markets to model aspects which typically arise when societies grow beyond what can be controlled in a centralized manner. A dynamic, evolving and robust ecosystem of autonomous agents is sometimes a preferred and possible outcome of the arms race as a hardening process.in eds.

As worms start spreading, knowing the worm prevalence patterns under the impact of various patching schemes is important for software vendors to decide whether or not, and when to release the patches. Due to the strong analogy between the spread of worms on Internet and the spread of disease among human society, we analytically model the spreading process and the impact of patching decisions on it by using the same techniques in epidemiological research. We find that, only by releasing patches providing immunity to susceptible users, the epidemic can be ceased efficiently. From the viewpoint of software vendors, the patch development cost and the reputation cost incurred indirectly from victim users should be balanced to decide whether, and when, the patch should be released.

Our basic model explores whether such emissions serve as a means of temporary withdrawal, preventing the winner of the current round of a contest from translating its victory into permanent possession of a contested resource. A variant of this model explores an alternative possibility, namely, that such emissions serve as a means of permanent retreat, attempting to prevent a winner from inflicting costs on a fleeing loser. Our results confirm that the underlying logic of either interpretation of weapons of rearguard action is sound; however, empirical observations on parasitoid wasp contests suggest that the more likely function of chemical weapons is to serve as a means of temporary withdrawal. While our work is centered around the particular biology of contest behavior in parasitoid wasps, it also provides the first contest model to explicitly consider self-inflicted damage costs, and thus responds to a recent call by empiricists for theory in this area",,"Article, PeerReviewed",,,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC'

Further, we propose that system designers should exploit the fact that they can impose certain restrictions on the intrud-ers and the way they interact with the system.

This complements existing predictions of loss aversion and risk seeking behaviour over the domain of avoidable losses and provides a starting point for developing explanations for patterns of behaviour that are observed in the terrorism context, including pauses in violence, even during brutality contests, and time-lags between terrorist attacks",,article,"sp/a theory, terrorist behaviour, risk, uncertainty, inevitable losses, aspiration, brutality, violence, contests, attacks, avoidable losses, Economics as a science, HB71-74",Open Economics,'Walter de Gruyter GmbH'

enemy release hypothesis,70569873,Policies and mechanisms for secure information release,,"Askarov, Aslan",2007,"Security assurance is an important challenge for modern computing. Intentional information release (declassification) is often crucial for such assurance. Security-critical systems demand expressive policies for information release that are beyond what conventional security models may offer.   This thesis studies practical and theoretical aspects of information release. It starts with a case study of implementation a declassification-intensive security protocol in a security-typed language. This, largest up to the publication date, case study suggests patterns for secure programming and demonstrates the multifaceted nature of declassification: from near-innocent relabeling of a ciphertext to dangerous release of secret keys.   As confirmed by the case study, declassifications of encrypted data before sending it on a public channel are ubiquitous in security protocols. These declassifications are justified by the usage of strong encryption primitives and secret encryption keys. The thesis introduces cryptographically-masked flows that enable reasoning about information flow in the presence of encryption, decryption, and key generation. We propose a type system that enforces security for a small imperative language with cryptographic primitives, which prevents dangerous program behavior such as giving away a secret key or confusing keys and non-keys. This approach is exemplified with secure implementations of cryptographic protocols.   To facilitate reasoning about released keys, the thesis suggests an attacker-centric model of gradual release. The attackers knowledge is modeled by the sets of possible secret inputs as functions of publicly observable events. Among the latter we distinguish special release events; the essence of gradual release is that the knowledge must remain constant between releases. Gradual release turns out to be a powerful foundation for release policies, which we demonstrate by formally connecting revelation-based and encryption-based declassification. We also show how gradual release can be enforced by security types and effects.   Addressing one aspect of declassification while leaving out the others would not be quite adequate. We present a policy that allows expressing both what is released and where in code it should be released. Moreover, we show that a security type system from the literature (which was designed for treating the what aspect) in fact enforces the combination of what and where policies",,Text.Thesis.Licentiate,,,"Chalmers University of Technology, Göteborg"

enemy release hypothesis,103793484,THE WORK-AVERSE ATTACKER MODEL Empirical evidence from the Symantec/WINE repository of IT attacks in the wild.,,,2016,"In this paper we present and validate a novel attacker model based on the economic notion that the attacker has limited resources to forge a new attack. We focus on the vulnerability exploitation case, whereby the attacker has to choose whether to exploit a new vulnerability or keep an old one. We postulate that most vulnerabilities remain unattacked, and that the exploit development cycle relates to software updates rather than to the disclosure of new vulnerabilities. We develop a simple mathematical model to show the mechanisms underlying our observations and name it “The Work-Averse Attacker Model”. We then leverage Symantec’s data sharing platform WINE to validate our model by analysing records of attacks against more than 1M real systems. We find the ‘Model of the Work-Averse Attacker ’ to be strongly supported by the data and, in particular, that: (a) the great majority of attacks per software version is driven by one vulnerability only; (b) an exploit lives two years before being substituted by a new one; (c) the exploit arrival rate depends on the software’s update rate rather than on time or knowledge of the vulnerability",,text,"Attacker model, Vulnerability exploitation",,

All rights reserved. Social networking sites have become instrumental in spreading information online, which unfortunately includes rumors and misinformation. Past studies have investigated the spread of rumors without considering that truth may spread simultaneously. This study considers both the spread of truth and rumor and investigates the result of their coexistence in a population. We formulated the spreader-spreader interaction model and the exposed-spreader interaction model based on the epidemiological SEIR model. In the spreader-spreader interaction model, the spreaders try to influence the opposing spreaders whereas, in the exposed-spreader interaction model, the spreaders try to influence the exposed individuals from the opposing side. In our study, we calculated the reproduction numbers for truth and rumor, determined the stability of the model at the equilibrium points, and determined an approach for spreading truth while halting rumors. In the spreader-spreader model, we have shown that increasing the removal rate of Spreaders of Rumor decreases the prevalence of rumor in the population. Whereas in the exposed-spreader model, we showed that increasing the conversion rate of Exposed to Rumor to Exposed to Truth significantly increases the amount of Exposed to Truth in the population, thereby making it an effective mechanism for promoting the spread of truth. In conclusion, it is harder to control the information epidemic in the exposed-spreader model but, compared to the spreader-spreader model, information spreads faster according to the exposed-spreader model. For certain information to be endemic to a population, our study proposes that spreaders take advantage during the first few days of the information diffusion process",,text,,,Animo Repository

Such conflict could occur solely on computer networks, but increasingly will be used in conjunction with traditional kinetic attack, or even to eliminate the need for kinetic attack. In either context, precise targeting and effective limiting of collateral damage from cyber weaponry are desired goals of any nation seeking to comply with the law of war. Since at least the Morris Worm, malicious software found in the wild has frequently contained mechanisms to target effectively, limit propagation, allow self-destruction, and minimize consumption of host resources to prevent detection and damage. This paper surveys major variants of malicious software from 1982 to present and synthesizes the control measures they contain that might limit collateral damage in future cyber weapons. As part of this work, we provide a framework for critical analysis of such measures. Our results indicate that a compelling framework for critical analysis emerges by studying these measures allowing classification of new forms of malware and providing insight into future novel technical mechanisms for limiting collateral damage",,text,Army Cyber Institute,,USMA Digital Commons

These histone- and protease-coated DNA structures are released by neutrophils in response to a variety of stimuli, including respiratory pathogens, and have been identified in the airways of patients with respiratory infection, cystic fibrosis, acute lung injury, primary graft dysfunction, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. NET production has been demonstrated in the lungs of mice infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Aspergillus fumigatus. Since the discovery of NETs over a decade ago, evidence that “NET evasion” might act as an immune protection strategy among respiratory pathogens, including group A Streptococcus, Bordetella pertussis, and Haemophilus influenzae, has been growing, with the majority of these studies being published in the past 2 years. Evasion strategies fall into three main categories: inhibition of NET release by down-regulating host inflammatory responses; degradation of NETs using pathogen-derived DNases; and resistance to the microbicidal components of NETs, which involves a variety of mechanisms, including encapsulation. Hence, the evasion of NETs appears to be a widespread strategy to allow pathogen proliferation and dissemination, and is currently a topic of intense research interest.

In order to control rumor propagation, spreading correct information to counterbalance the effect of the rumor seems more appropriate than simply blocking rumors by censorship or network disruption. In this paper, a competitive diffusion model, namely Linear Threshold model with One Direction state Transition (LT1DT), is proposed for modeling competitive information propagation of two different types in the same network. Unlike other competitive diffusion models in which individual beliefs do not change once adopted, LT1DT can model the behavior of a person that, although initially influenced by the rumor, can change his/her mind when receiving correct information.

The presented technique is analytical and is based on a simplified theoretical-game model of the conflict situation “Radar – means of reconnaissance of the enemy”, provides a forecast of the probability of electronic and fire impact on the radar within certain positions. The evaluation criterion is the minimum value of the probability of suppression of the radar station by options. The convenience of the described approach is determined by its simplicity and clear logic in determining the formal consequences of the accepted hypotheses and assumptions in the formation of the forecast of the results of combat use of the radar station.

Why does selection favour cooperation among species rather than cheaters that accept benefits but provide nothing in return? Here we present a general model that predicts three key factors will be important in mutualism evolution: (i) high benefit to cost ratio, (ii) high within-species relatedness and (iii) high between-species fidelity. These factors operate by moderating three types of feedback benefit from mutualism: cooperator association, partner-fidelity feedback and partner choice. In defining the relationship between these processes, our model also allows an assessment of their relative importance. Importantly, the model suggests that phenotypic feedbacks (partner-fidelity feedback, partner choice) are a more important explanation for between-species cooperation than the development of genetic correlations among species (cooperator association). We explain the relationship of our model to existing theories and discuss the empirical evidence for our predictions.status: publishe",,info:eu-repo/semantics/article,"Evolution, Models, Theoretical, Selection (Genetics)",Journal of Evolutionary Biology,'Wiley'

W., Pierce, Naomi E.",2016,"Although mutualisms are common in all ecological communities and have played key roles in the diversification of life, our current understanding of the evolution of cooperation applies mostly to social behavior within a species. A central question is whether mutualisms persist because hosts have evolved costly punishment of cheaters. Here, we use the economic theory of employment contracts to formulate and distinguish between two mechanisms that have been proposed to prevent cheating in host–symbiont mutualisms, partner fidelity feedback (PFF) and host sanctions (HS). Under PFF, positive feedback between host fitness and symbiont fitness is sufficient to prevent cheating; in contrast, HS posits the necessity of costly punishment to maintain mutualism. A coevolutionary model of mutualism finds that HS are unlikely to evolve de novo, and published data on legume–rhizobia and yucca–moth mutualisms are consistent with PFF and not with HS. Thus, in systems considered to be textbook cases of HS, we find poor support for the theory that hosts have evolved to punish cheating symbionts; instead, we show that even horizontally transmitted mutualisms can be stabilized via PFF. PFF theory may place previously underappreciated constraints on the evolution of mutualism and explain why punishment is far from ubiquitous in nature.Organismic and Evolutionary Biolog",,Journal Article,"evolution of cooperation, punishment, symbiosis, partner fidelity feedback, host sanctions",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'
Enhanced Mutualism Hypothesis,302982630,Coevolutionary adaptation in mutualisms,,"Wyatt, Gregory Alan Kenneth, West, Stuart A., Gardner, Andy",2014,"Natural selection favours those individuals that respond best to novel features of their selective environment. For many, a critical challenge is responding to evolutionary change in mutualistic species. These responses create complex feedbacks, so only coevolutionary approaches are able to fully answer key questions about the maintenance or disruption of mutualistic behaviour, and explain the range of mechanisms that allow individuals to benefit from these associations. I first consider the hypothesis that economic models studying multiple classes of traders, where each trader seeks to optimise its own payoffs will yield insights into mutualistic systems. I show that individuals can be favoured to discriminate amongst potential partners based on the price for which they provide resources. Then, I show that market mechanisms can maintain cooperation and drive specialisation in mutualistic systems. I extend this market model to allow individuals to restrict a mutualistic partner's access to resources, and show that this strategy can stabilise cooperation and increase the fitness of both partners. I also explicitly incorporate relatedness in my market model. I show that high relatedness sometimes increases cooperativeness in members of a mutualistic species, but sometimes decreases cooperativeness as it narrow the scope for partner choice to maintain cooperation. Having studied market mechanisms, I consider indiscriminate costly help to members of another species. I discover that this trait can be favoured by natural selection and can be classified as either altruism between or altruism within species. Finally, I consider a framework for analysing coevolved phenotypic responses to a partner's cooperativeness, a challenging process to model. I demonstrate that this framework can yield firm predictions about behaviour whenever partners hold private information about their costs and benefits.This thesis is currently not available via ORA",,"text, thesis","Biology, Evolution (zoology), Game theory,economics,social and behavioral sciences (mathematics), mutualism, social evolution, cooperation, coevolution, adaptation",,

The costs and benefits of mutualism often depend on the abiotic or biotic context in which an interaction occurs, and experimental manipulations can induce shifts in interaction outcomes from mutualism all the way to parasitism. Yet, research suggests that mutualisms rarely turn parasitic in nature. Similarly, despite the potential for 'cheating' to undermine mutualism evolution, empirical evidence for fitness conflicts between partners and, thus, selection for cheating in mutualisms is scant. Furthermore, mutualism seldom leads to parasitism at macroevolutionary timescales. Thus, I argue here that mutualisms do not deserve their reputation for ecological and evolutionary instability, and are not on the verge of breakdown.I also acknowledge funding from an NSERC Discovery Grant and Accelerator Supplement, and thank S.

Two necessary requisites to obtain this result are (i) a small population or a large subdivided metapulation and (ii) an asymmetry between partners in such a way that one of them (donor) proposes the cooperation and elects the partner, whereas the other (receiver) never rejects the offer.

Selection against cheaters should eliminate genetic variation in partner quality—yet such variation is often found in natural populations. One explanation for this paradox is that mutualism outcomes are determined not only by responses to partner performance but also by partner signals. Here, we build a model of coevolution in a symbiotic mutualism, in which hosts’ ability to sanction noncooperative symbionts and recognition of symbiont signals are determined by separate loci, as are symbionts’ cooperation and expression of signals. In the model, variation persists without destabilizing the interaction, in part because coevolution of symbiont signals and host recognition is altered by the coevolution of sanctions and cooperation, and vice versa. Individual-based simulations incorporating population structure strongly corroborate these results. The dual systems of sanctions and partner recognition converge toward conditions similar to some economic models of mutualistic symbiosis, in which hosts offering the right incentives to potential symbionts can initiate symbiosis without screening for partner quality. These results predict that mutualists can maintain variation in recognition of partner signals or in the ability to sanction noncooperators without destabilizing mutualism, and they reinforce the notion that studies of mutualism should consider communication between partners as well as the exchange of benefits",,info:eu-repo/semantics/dataset,,,Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS)
Enhanced Mutualism Hypothesis,33898972,Understanding mutualism when there is adaptation to the partner,10.1111/j.0022-0477.2004.00952.x,"de Mazancourt, C., Loreau, M., Dieckmann, U.",2005,"1. A mutualism is a mutually beneficial interaction between individuals of two species. Here we show that the degree of benefit resulting from an interaction depends on whether adaptation within the mutualism is considered.   2. A species' proximate response measures the short-term effect of addition or removal of the partner species, without allowing for any adaptation. We define a proximate mutualism as an interaction in which removal of each partner results in a decreased performance of the other, i.e. both species show a positive proximate response to the presence of the partner.   3. A proximate mutualism might, however, only reflect evolved dependence (i.e. the species has lost its ability to perform well without the partner). Some authors therefore insist on an ultimate criterion, regardless of the use of proximate responses in almost all empirical studies.   4. A species' ultimate response measures the long-term effect of adding or removing the partner species, thus allowing the focal species to adapt. In an ultimate mutualism neither partner could ever have performed as well without the other. In other words, a mutualism is called ultimate if both species show a positive ultimate response to the presence of the partner. Despite the conceptual attractiveness of this definition, ultimate responses are difficult to measure, rendering its use operationally problematic.   5. Mutualistic evolution, the evolution of a trait that is costly to the bearer but beneficial to its partner, is not, paradoxically, a necessary consequence of either proximate or ultimate mutualism. Another counterintuitive result is that even obligate mutualisms are not necessarily ultimate interactions.   6. We conclude that the proximate response is the only workable criterion for mutualism. Our understanding of mutualism, however, requires further evaluation of how evolved dependence may be responsible for such responses.   7. These concepts clarify the ongoing debate about whether plantherbivore interactions can be considered as mutualistic.   8. This is not a semantic case of hair splitting: naove aspects in current views of mutualism need revision. In most, if not all, interactions now considered as mutualisms, some of the measured benefits are likely to result from evolved dependence, rather than what we would like to consider as ultimate benefits",,"Article, PeerReviewed",,,'Wiley'

Why provide costly services to another species if the feedback of this provision also happens to benefit intra-specific competitors that provide no service? Rewarding cooperators and punishing defectors can help maintain mutualism; this is not possible, however, when one can only respond to the collective action of one's partners, which is likely to be the case in many common symbioses. We show how the theory of public goods can explain the stability of mutualism when discrimination between cooperators and defectors is not possible: if two groups of individuals trade goods that are non-linear, increasing functions of the number of contributions, their mutualistic interaction is maintained by the exchange of these public goods, even when it is not possible to punish defectors, which can persist at relatively high frequencies.

In an evolutionary game where two defenders can cooperate to defend a common resource, this paper analyzes the common-enemy hypothesis when adversity is endogenous, in that an attacker sets the number of attacks. As a benchmark, we first consider exogenous adversity, where adversity is not subject to evolution. In this case, the common-enemy hypothesis is predicted when the degree of complementarity between defenders’ defensive efforts is sufficiently low. When the degree of complementarity is high, the hypothesis is predicted only when cooperation costs are high; when cooperation costs are instead low, a competing hypothesis is predicted, where adversity discourages cooperation. Second, we consider the case of endogenous adversity. In this case, we continue to predict the competing hypothesis for a high degree of complementarity and low cooperation costs.

Contemporary theory on the population ecology of mutualism explicitly focuses on how fitness benefits are conferred from a mutualist to a focal population, which depends on the mutualist partner's density (i.e., functional response).  This body of work implicitly makes the assumption that the per capita benefit received by the focal population is the same, regardless of its density.  The consequence of this assumption was examined in one study that found it to be important, but partner density was not examined.  In this study we bridge examining intraspecific and interspecific densities to investigate their roles on the population dynamics of mutualism.  We created a two-species model that allowed us to explicitly modify both how benefits are received as a function of intraspecific density and how benefits are conferred by a partner as a function of interspecific density.  We also synthesized empirical work on mutualism that explicitly took focal or partner densities into account.  Our principal finding was that anytime mutualistic benefits were either conferred or received at low densities, irrespective or the strength of the mutualistic benefit, populations were always stable and never positively fed back.  We found few studies that explicitly considered population densities, but most show mutualistic benefits being received or conferred at low densities---a promising bearing for future research.  Receiving benefits, and consequently increasing growth, when rare is a key component in many of ways we understand community ecology, including promoting coexistence and strengthening resilience.  As these population models act as the foundation of other, more complex dynamical models, it is of high importance to empirically evaluate the role of intraspecific density on population dynamics of mutualism.</div",,"Image, Poster","Population Ecology, Mutualisms, density dependence, population dynamics models, Evolution 2017",,

We show that: (i) restriction can be favoured when restricting individuals increase their comparative advantage and thus receive more favourable terms of trade; (ii) restriction maintains cooperation in conditions where cooperative behaviour would otherwise collapse; and (iii) restriction can lead to either an increase or decrease in a restricted individual’s fitness.

These possible tactics motivate the hypotheses that people possess egocentric and allocentric representations of the social world, that people are motivated to conceal this information, and that egocentric friend-ranking is determined by allocentric representations of partners' friend-rankings (more than others' traits).We report results from three studies that confirm predictions derived from the alliance hypothesis.

In this paper, firstly, we examine the history and signification of mutualism in relation to symbiosis. Then, we consider the link between concepts and models of mutualism. Models of mutualism depend on different concepts we use: If mutualism is situated at populations' level, it will be expressed by Lotka-Volterra models, concerning exclusively populations' size. If mutualism is considered as a resources' exchange or a biological market increasing the fitness of these organisms, it will be described at an individual level by a cost-benefit model. Our analysis will be limited to the history and epistemology of Lotka-Volterra models and we hypothesize that these models are adapted at first to translate dynamic evolutions of mutualism. They render stability or variations of size and assume that there are clear distinctions and a state of equilibrium between populations of different species. Italian mathematician Vito Volterra demonstrated that biological associations consist in a constant relation between some species. In 1931 and 1935, Volterra described the general form of antagonistic or mutualistic biological associations by the same differential equations. We recognize that these equations have been more used to model competition or prey-predator interactions, but a simple sign change allows describing mutualism. The epistemological problem is the following: Volterra's equations help us to conceptualize a global phenomenon. However, mutualistic interactions may have stronger effects away from equilibrium and these effects may be better understood at individual level. We conclude that, between 1985 and 2000, some researchers carried on working and converting Lotka-Volterra models but this description appeared as insufficient. So, others researchers adopted an economical viewpoint, considering mutualism as a biological market",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/article, Journal articles","[SHS.HISPHILSO] Humanities and Social Sciences/History, Philosophy and Sociology of Sciences",,Springer Verlag

Glen, Frederickson, Megan E., Yu, Douglas W., Pierce, Naomi E.",2010,"Although mutualisms are common in all ecological communities and have played key roles in the diversification of life, our current understanding of the evolution of cooperation applies mostly to social behavior within a species. A central question is whether mutualisms persist because hosts have evolved costly punishment of cheaters. Here, we use the economic theory of employment contracts to formulate and distinguish between two mechanisms that have been proposed to prevent cheating in host–symbiont mutualisms, partner fidelity feedback (PFF) and host sanctions (HS). Under PFF, positive feedback between host fitness and symbiont fitness is sufficient to prevent cheating; in contrast, HS posits the necessity of costly punishment to maintain mutualism. A coevolutionary model of mutualism finds that HS are unlikely to evolve de novo, and published data on legume–rhizobia and yucca–moth mutualisms are consistent with PFF and not with HS. Thus, in systems considered to be textbook cases of HS, we find poor support for the theory that hosts have evolved to punish cheating symbionts; instead, we show that even horizontally transmitted mutualisms can be stabilized via PFF. PFF theory may place previously underappreciated constraints on the evolution of mutualism and explain why punishment is far from ubiquitous in nature",,"Article, PeerReviewed",,,'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'

As is wellknown since Darwin, this creates challenges for evolutionaryexplanation, since in modern evolutionary theory, cooperativebehavior must always be grounded in the individual and in-clusive fitness of the cooperator.In this modern context, there are two main theories of theevolution of human cooperation, both of which focus on themost difficult theoretical problem from the point of view ofevolutionary theory: altruism. The first theory comes fromevolutionary psychology and is often called the Big MistakeHypothesis (e.g., Burnham and Johnson 2005). The basic ideais that human altruistic tendencies evolved at a time whenhumans lived in small groups, comprised mostly of kin. Inthis setting, altruistic acts would either (a) benefit kin, andso evolve due to kin selection, or else (b) benefit the altruistby enhancing in some way her chances for reciprocity, whichis especially critical in small groups in which reputationalassessment among familiar interactants is constant.

Thispaper was submitted 9 II 11 and accepted 3 IX 11.some tendency toward altruism (and antipathy toward cheat-ers) because the proximate mechanism operates as if the an-cient, small-group conditions still held.The second theory is the Cultural Group Selection Hy-pothesis (e.g., Henrich and Henrich 2007; Richerson andBoyd 2005), and it focuses on a later stage in human evolutioncharacterized by larger social groups. The basic idea is thatsocial groups with more altruists will, for various reasons,outcompete other groups. The difference from previous groupselection hypotheses is that the main transmission across gen-erations takes place not genetically but culturally. For otherreasons, modern humans are built to imitate others (e.g.,successful others or the majority), and so if a group has al-truists, others will often imitate them, and that will lead togroup success. As groups become larger in scale, those thatcreate social norms and institutions that better promote al-truism will again thrive relative to others. No biological ad-aptations for altruism are necessarily involved here, but thetheory does allow for later gene-culture coevolution in whichindividuals biologically adapt to life in a culture characterizedby conformist social transmission, group punishment andnorms, and group competition.In what follows, we propose an approach to the evolutionof human cooperation that begins in a different place. Ourstarting point is not cooperation as altruistic helping, butrather cooperation as mutualistic collaboration. Our hypoth-esis, which we call the Interdependence Hypothesis, is that atThis content downloaded from 128.243.002.141 on January 25, 2016 04:25:49 AMAll use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).674 Current Anthropology Volume 53, Number 6, December 2012some point humans created lifeways in which collaboratingwith others was necessary for survival and procreation (andcheating was controlled by partner choice). This situation ofinterdependence led inevitably to altruism, as individuals nat-urally wanted to help the collaborative partners on whomthey depended for, for example, foraging success. Moreover,interdependent collaboration also helps to explain humans’unique forms of cognition and social organization, since it iscollaboration, not altruism, that creates the many coordina-tion problems that arise as individuals attempt to put theirheads together in acts of shared intentionality1 to create andmaintain the complex technologies, symbol systems, and cul-tural institutions of modern human societies.Our evolutionary story comprises two distinct steps, thefirst focusing on small-scale contexts (though we focus onaspects different from the Big Mistake Hypothesis) and thesecond focusing on group-level contexts (though we focus onaspects different from the Cultural Group Selection Hypoth-esis). First, small-scale collaboration involving cognitivelycomplex coordination problems took place initially, we willargue, in the context of collaborative foraging. Although hu-mans’ more stable reproductive bonds (Chapais 2008) andcooperative breeding (Hrdy 2009) clearly played an importantrole in establishing the motivational and emotional founda-tions, the cognitive dimension of human cooperation evolvedin contexts in which, in order to acquire food, individualshad to create together various coordination strategies (ofteninvolving technologies), which they then could communicatecooperatively to others within and across generations (Ster-elny 2012). Second, group-level collaboration followed as theentire social group needed to work together interdependentlyin order to compete with other social groups, leading to suchthings as group-created conventions, norms, and institutions.This step was undoubtedly followed by something like culturalgroup selection, but cultural group selection explains why theparticular social norms and institutions of particular culturalgroups have prevailed, and this assumes species-universalskills and motivations—such as those we will posit—for cre-ating social norms and institutions in the first place.In support of our hypotheses, we focus on two sources ofevidence not common in anthropology. First, we invoke ex-perimental studies, many from our own laboratory, that com-pare the cognitive and motivational skills of humans, mostlyyoung children, and their nearest great ape relatives (as rep-resentative, in a very general way, of the last common an-cestor). We show that even young children are adapted forcollaborative activities in a way that other great apes are not.Second, we also in some cases invoke human ontogenetic1. Here we use the term “shared intentionality” to refer to collaborativephenomena in general. We use the term “joint intentionality” for the adhoc, temporary collaborations characteristic of, e.g., foraging parties (step1 of our story) and the term “collective intentionality” for the moreimpersonal yet permanent group-minded practices and modes of col-laboration that characterize cultural groups as a whole (step 2 of ourstory).sequences as suggestive of potential phylogenetic sequences,for example, that young children in fact (and possibly oflogical necessity) learn to collaborate with other individualsin concrete situations before they construct more abstractgroup-level phenomena such as social norms and institutions.We invoke observations of modern foragers and some paleo-anthropological data, as is more customary in evolutionarytheorizing, in a few places as well.First Step: Obligate Collaborative ForagingThe central challenge of social life is often presented as aPrisoner’s Dilemma in which the individual must choose be-tween its own well-being and that of the group. But the Pris-oner’s Dilemma arises only in very special circumstances, andit does indeed tend to block cooperation. A better model forreal-life cooperation is the Stag Hunt (Skyrms 2004). StagHunt situations are those in which (i) individuals must col-laborate with others to benefit, (ii) the benefits of the collab-oration are greater than those of any solo alternatives, and(iii) all solo alternatives must be forsaken (risked) in orderto collaborate. In the classic parable, I am hunting alone forhares when I spy a stag—which is much better food but whichI cannot capture alone. You are in exactly the same situation,and so it is in both our interests to drop our pursuit of haresand collaborate to capture the stag and then share the spoils.(This general scenario can easily be extended to other foragingactivities, including many gathering activities such as pro-curing honey collaboratively.)Human collaborative foraging first occurred, we hypoth-esize, in Stag Hunt–type situations in which all participantshad alternatives but anticipated an even greater benefit fromsuccessful capturing of the stag (see Alvard 2012). Althoughmuch of the foraging of contemporary hunter-gatherers isonly loosely collaborative, this is very likely because modernforagers have the kinds of projectile weapons that enable in-dividuals to be successful (from a safe distance) where pre-viously only small groups of individuals working togethercould attain foraging success (and contemporary foragers alsosee themselves as part of a group, as in our step 2 [see below],and so bring the bounty back to the home base for sharing).In stark contrast, nonhuman great apes—and so, by hypoth-esis, the last common ancestor—were and are almost exclu-sively individual foragers. Chimpanzees and bonobos maysearch for food in small social groups, but when they findfood, each individual procures and consumes it on its own(with sharing only under special circumstances). They do notextract or otherwise obtain food by working collaborativelywith others, nor do they, as humans do, bring food back tosome central location to provision others.The one potential exception is the group hunting of mon-keys by some (but not all) groups of chimpanzees (Boeschand Boesch 1989; Watts and Mitani 2002). What happensprototypically is that a small party of male chimpanzees spiesThis content downloaded from 128.243.002.141 on January 25, 2016 04:25:49 AMAll use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).Tomasello et al. Interdependence Hypothesis 675a red colobus monkey somewhat separated from its group,and they proceed to surround and capture it (normally oneindividual begins the chase and others scramble to the mon-key’s possible escape routes). One individual actually capturesthe monkey, but all participants usually end up getting at leastsome meat. Chimpanzee group hunting can be reasonablymodeled as a Stag Hunt situation, since it is difficult forindividuals to capture monkeys on their own, and they alwayshave other, less exciting alternative foods potentially available.If the many collaborative foraging activities of humans andthe one collaborative foraging activity of great apes representStag Hunt–type situations, we may compare humans and theirnearest great ape relatives in terms of their proximate mech-anisms, both cognitive and motivational, for operating in suchsituations. We may best do this by telling a very general evo-lutionary story (supported by comparative experimental data)about how humans developed new strategies to meet the threemain challenges to Stag Hunt collaboration as an evolution-arily stable subsistence strategy:a) Sharing the spoils: individuals had to find some way todivide the spoils at the end of the collaboration such thatthere was no destructive fighting and such that everyone wasincentivized for future stag hunting.b) Coordination: individuals had to find some way to makea confidence-inspiring “group decision” about whether to gofor the stag, given that each of them had to relinquish their“hare in the hand” to do so.c) Temptations to free ride: individuals had to solve theproblem that if there were more people present than wereneeded to capture the stag (but all could eat), then everyonehad an incentive to let the others do the hard and risky workof stag killing—resulting in inaction from everyone.In their group hunting of monkeys, chimpanzees have waysof meeting all three of these challenges. But humans havecome to meet them in some demonstrably different ways,using species-unique proximate mechanisms.Sharing the SpoilsChimpanzees, like most primates, are mostly herbivorous(and insectivorous). They forage in small social parties mainlyfor ripe fruit and some insects, consuming other vegetationas backup. When the party finds a patch of fruit, typicallyeveryone gets some by scrambling, which works well becausethe fruit is at least moderately spread out in the tree or onthe ground. If they encounter monopolizable food, the en-suing contest-competition will go to the dominant individualin typical mammalian fashion.The consequences of this way of doing business for col-laboration may be clearly seen in a recent experiment. Melis,Hare, and Tomasello (2006b) presented pairs of chimpanzeeswith out-of-reach food on a platform that could be obtainedonly if both individuals pulled simultaneously on the twoends of a rope. When there were two piles of food, one infront of each individual, the pair often collaborated success-fully. However, when there was only one pile of food in themiddle of the platform, pulling it in often resulted in thedominant individual monopolizing all of the food. This nat-urally demotivated the subordinate for future collaborationwith this individual, and so cooperation fell apart over trials.Chimpanzees’ predominant solution to food competition ingeneral, namely, dominance, tends to destabilize collaborativeforaging over time.So why does not dominance undermine chimpanzees’group hunting of monkeys? The answer is twofold. First, dom-inant chimpanzees do not normally take small parcels of foodaway from subordinates who already have it in their grasp.So if the captor of the monkey is subordinate, he neverthelessis typically able to eat his fill. Second, even if the captor isdominant, he cannot monopolize the carcass himself becauseit is too big. As with social carnivores like lions and wolves,trying to protect a large carcass with other hungry individualsapproaching is a losing battle. After the kill, noncaptors harassthe captor (no matter his dominance) and obtain pieces ofmeat from the too-big-to-monopolize carcass, with those whoharass most getting the most meat (Gilby 2006). Althoughthere is some favoritism in “meat sharing” toward coalitionarypartners (Mitani and Watts 2001), the most important factorin noncaptors’ obtaining of meat is, not surprisingly, domi-nance (Boesch 1994).Humans share their spoils differently. Contemporaryhunter-gatherers routinely share the spoils of their collabo-rative foraging on the scene, without harassment, and largepackets of food are almost always brought back to some cen-tral location and shared with nonparticipants (Gurven 2004).Different cultural groups may do this differently, and it maywork differently with particular resources, but there are nohuman groups who behave like other great apes in simplyscrambling for food competitively in most situations, withdominants taking all that they can regardless of others. Andunlike great apes, humans actively provision their childrenwith food for many years, with human children being wellinto their teens in most cases before they actually pull theirown weight (Hill 1993).In experiments, humans are much more generous withfood than are chimpanzees, and they expect their conspecificsto be more generous (even fair) as well. Thus, in economicgames, humans routinely take into account the needs anddesires of others, whereas this is not the case for chimpanzees.For example, humans routinely give a significant portion ofsome windfall resource to an unknown individual in dictatorgames, whereas no one has ever performed a dictator gamewith chimpanzees because the outcome—that they would ac-tively give none of their windfall to others—is already known.In ultimatum games, humans typically expect their playingpartner to expect a reasonable offer (with “reasonable” de-pending on general cultural norms; Henrich et al. 2006),whereas chimpanzees in the ultimatum game seem not totake into account the needs or expectations of their playingpartner at all (Jensen, Call, and Tomasello 2007a).This content downloaded from 128.243.002.141 on January 25, 2016 04:25:49 AMAll use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).676 Current Anthropology Volume 53, Number 6, December 2012But it is not until the second step of our account (in thesection “Second Step: Group-Mindedness”) that we includesuch things as group-wide social norms of fairness and thelike, and so for now, a better representative of the humanspecies would be children—before they have become fullynormative beings. Nevertheless, even without internalizednorms, human children are more generous with valued re-sources than are their great ape relatives. In one fairly directcomparison, both Silk et al. (2005) and Jensen et al. (2006)found that when pulling in food for themselves, chimpanzeesdid not care whether this also resulted in a companion gettingfood. In contrast, Brownell, Svetlova, and Nichols (2009)found that even 2-year-old children—well before they self-govern through social norms—chose to pull food to them-selves more often when that also meant food for their com-panion. Chimpanzees will in some situations help others gainaccess to food (Melis et al. 2011b; Warneken et al. 2007), butonly if the helper has no possibility of obtaining the foodherself.Perhaps of most importance for the current account, hu-man children share the spoils after collaboration in species-unique ways. Thus, Warneken et al. (2011) presented pairsof 3-year-old children with the same task presented to chim-panzees by Melis, Hare, and Tomasello (2006b): a board theyhad to pull in together, with food either (i) predivided onthe two ends of the board or (ii) clumped in the middle.Unlike the apes, children collaborated readily in both of thesesituations. Even more striking, in a direct comparison of spe-cies, Hamann, Warneken, and Tomasello (2011) found that3-year-old children shared resources more equitably if thoseresources resulted from their collaborative efforts, rather thanfrom parallel work or no work at all, whereas chimpanzees“shared” (allowed the other to take) to the same degree (andinfrequently) no matter how the spoils were produced (seealso Melis, Schneider, and Tomasello 2011a).How might we account for an evolutionary transition fromthe way that other great apes treat food to the way that hu-mans treat food—especially after a collaboration? One es-pecially plausible transitional context is scavenging. Thus, asthe genus Homo was emerging some 2 million years ago, aglobal cooling and drying trend created an expansion of openenvironments and a radiation in terrestrial monkeys, whowould have competed with Homo for many plant foods. Scav-enging large carcasses killed by other animals would have beenone possible response. Such scavenging would have requiredmultiple participants, as other carnivores would be competingfor those carcasses as well.Individuals would be especially well suited for scavengingif they were tolerant of conspecifics cofeeding on a carcasswith them. An important finding in this regard is that whenexperimenters pair together chimpanzee individuals who areespecially tolerant with one another in the context of food(established by an independent food tolerance test), they aremuch more likely to collaborate successfully and share thespoils at the end than are intolerant partners (Melis, Hare,and Tomasello 2006b). And bonobos show both more tol-erance around food and more cooperation in obtaining andsharing monopolizable food than do chimpanzees (Hare etal. 2007). These findings suggest that variation in tolerancearound food among individuals of the last common ancestorto Homo and Pan might have served as the raw material onwhich natural selection worked on the way to a species thatactively shared the spoils of collaboration (Hare and Toma-sello 2005).It is also likely that at some point, individuals who at-tempted to hog all of the food at a scavenged carcass wouldbe actively repelled by others and perhaps shunned in otherways as well—a first step toward what Boehm (2001) calls“counter-dominance.” Chimpanzees already engage in socialselection of collaborative partners, preferentially choosing apartner with whom they have had success over one withwhom they have previously had difficulties (Melis, Hare, andTomasello 2006a). Scavenging Homo would thus have alreadyhad a tendency to avoid dominants who tried to monopolizethe carcass. Moreover, a small coalition attacking a greedydominant to drive him away would have been a simple ex-tension from driving other species away from the carcass (andof course chimpanzees already form small social coalitions inintragroup conflicts). The outcome of socially selectingagainst dominants is of course that good cooperators get se-lected “for” by being chosen more often as collaborative part-ners.As humans became ever more dependent on collaborativeforaging—and so ever more interdependent with others inthe social group—additional factors contributed to their ten-dency to share resources with others relatively generously andeven fairly. But for now, we are interested only in the earlysteps (perhaps in combination with cooperative breeding),and our proposal is that in the context of scavenging, theindividuals who did best were those who (1) were tolerant ofothers peacefully cofeeding on the same carcass and (2) didnot attempt to hog the spoils and so be socially selected againstby others for selfish behavior.CoordinationBoesch and Boesch (1989) describe chimpanzees’ group hunt-ing of monkeys in very human-like terms, with participantshaving a shared goal and well-defined roles. Focusing on thechimpanzees of the Taı¨ Forest (since in more open environ-ments chimpanzees use more solo and less coordinated strat-egies), they posit that all of the chimpanzees have the sharedgoal of capturing the monkey. Then a “driver” begins chasinga monkey, while “blockers” prevent lines of escape and an“ambusher” attempts to make the kill. However, it is alsopossible that what the chimpanzees are doing is somethingless cooperative, that is, the initiating chimpanzee is attempt-ing to capture the monkey for itself since the captor gets mostmeat (or else he knows from experience that once he initiatesthe chase, a group kill will often ensue and he will get at leastThis content downloaded from 128.243.002.141 on January 25, 2016 04:25:49 AMAll use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).Tomasello et al. Interdependence Hypothesis 677some meat), and then the others go to places where theyexpect to maximize their chances of capturing the fleeingmonkey, which also increases the group’s chances as an un-intentional by-product (Tomasello 2008; Tomasello et al.2005).It is not that each chimpanzee is scrambling for the monkeyon its own, ignoring the others. In deciding what to do, eachparticipant takes into account the position of the others andtheir behavior and how these might influence the monkey’sflight. The coordination is therefore an emergent propertygenerated by individual decision making not aimed at thatcoordination. Thus, Melis, Hare, and Tomasello (2006a)found that in situations in which a chimpanzee could pull ina board with food by itself, that is what it did (in preferenceto opening a door for a potential partner). But if pulling inthe board required two individuals, then they would eitherwait for their partner or even open a door for the other tojoin. The chimpanzees were mainly interested in their ownacquisition of food, but they understood when they neededa partner for success. Similarly, Bullinger, Melis, and Toma-sello (2011a) and Rekers, Haun, and Tomasello (2011) foundthat when chimpanzees were given the choice to obtain foodby collaborating with a partner or acting alone, they mostoften chose to act alone, whereas human children most oftenchose to collaborate.Nevertheless, even though chimpanzees will go and opena door for a necessary partner, they do not actively com-municate about the collaboration much or at all. In the wild,chimpanzees do vocalize their excitement at various pointsthroughout the hunt. But chimpanzee vocalizations, as vir-tually all primate vocalizations, are mostly hardwired to par-ticular stimulus and motivational states, so what is being ex-pressed is general excitement (with the same vocalizationsused when excited about other things) and not anything aboutthe content of what is happening or what the vocalizer wantsto happen. There are no reported vocalizations (or gestures)specifically associated with hunting or coordination. Indeed,in the laboratory, several investigators have reported a strikinglack of communication among chimpanzees as they engagein collaborative tasks (e.g., Melis, Hare, and Tomasello 2009;Povinelli and O’Neil 2000), including in tasks in which theyhad previously communicated with humans (Hirata and Fuwa2007).This overall picture may be clearly seen in a recent exper-iment constructed as a Stag Hunt for pairs of chimpanzees(Bullinger et al. 2011b). Each individual had access to a lesspreferred “hare” food, which she would lose for good if sheleft it. Then a highly preferred “stag” food appeared thatrequired the pair to work together for access (which theyknew from previous experience). Because of the risk involved,communicating with the partner, or at least checking on thepartner before forsaking the hare in hand, would seem to becalled for. But what chimpanzees did in this situation wasalmost always bolt for the stag (90% of the time when apartner was present) without communicating or checking,presumably optimistic that the partner would be coming also(leader-follower strategy). They did this even in a conditionin which they could not see what the partner was doing unlessthey looked around a barrier (which they did not do). If anindividual arrived at the stag first, she sometimes banged onthings to induce the other to join her, but there was no com-munication or systematic checking of the partner ahead oftime as a way of coordinating their decisions.Humans, in contrast, coordinate and communicate abouttheir decision making in such situations to form a joint goal.To form a joint goal, we must know together that each of ushas the goal of working with the other (Bratman 1992). Know-ing together means engaging in some form of recursive mindreading (we each know that the other knows, etc.), which isthe basic cognitive ability that enables humans to engage inall forms of joint and collective intentionality (Tomasello2008, 2009), including joint attention, common conceptualground, and all “public” knowledge and activities. And oncethey have formed a joint goal, humans are committed to it.Thus, when their collaborative partner stops interacting withthem, even 18-month-old infants expect her to be committed,and so they attempt in various ways to reengage her—asopposed to human-raised chimpanzees, who do not (War-neken, Chen, and Tomasello 2006). Slightly older childrenunderstand and respect their own commitment, such that theykeep pursuing the joint goal until both partners have receivedtheir reward even if they have already received theirs (Ha-mann, Warneken, and Tomasello 2012)—which, again, is nottrue of chimpanzees (Greenberg et al. 2010). And when 3-year-olds need to break away from a joint commitment witha partner, they even “take leave” through some form of im-plicit or explicit communication—as a way of acknowledgingand asking to be excused for breaking the commitment (Gra¨-fenhain et al. 2009).Young children also understand the role of the partner inthe collaborative activity in a way that chimpanzees do not,and they communicate about roles as well. Thus, when theyare forced to switch roles in a collaborative activity, youngchildren already know what to do from having observed theirpartner earlier from the “other side” of the collaboration—whereas chimpanzees seemingly do not (Tomasello and Car-penter 2005). And even prelinguistic children communicatewith others to help them play their role in a joint activity,for example, by using a pointing gesture to direct them tothe part of an apparatus they should be acting on—whereas,once more, human-raised chimpanzees do not (Warneken,Chen, and Tomasello 2006; and of course human adults com-municate about their collaboration with language). One pos-sible explanation for this different understanding of the rolesin the collaborative activity is that humans, but not chim-panzees, comprehend joint activities and their different rolesfrom a bird’s-eye view in which all roles are interchangeable,that is, conceptualized in an agent-neutral manner in a singlerepresentational format.

How didearly humans move from a chimpanzee mode of initiatingand coordinating Stag Hunt activities—based either on aleader-follower strategy or on a kind of naive optimism aboutthe other’s actions—to the modern human mode in whichindividuals coordinate their decision making through somekind of implicit or explicit communication, resulting in a jointcommitment to follow through until everyone gets their re-ward, with a coordination of interchangeable, agent-neutralroles?The main thing to note is that, given the normal feedingecology of chimpanzees, their approach to Stag Hunt situa-tions makes immanently good sense—and indeed is success-ful. Their main food sources are fruits and other vegetation,and monkeys are an addition. A chimpanzee on its way to afig tree is sacrificing only a small amount of time and energyto participate in an unsuccessful monkey hunt.2 With humans,the hypothesis is that at some point their scavenging turnedinto active collaborative hunting and gathering (perhaps withthe emergence of Homo heidelbergensis some 800 kya (thou-sand years ago; Dubreuil 2010), with evidence for bringinglarge prey back to a home base from at least 400–200 kya(Stiner, Barkai, and Gopher 2009). The key point in the tran-sition from chimpanzees, from a psychological point of view,would have been when the decision making became morechallenging, in particular when the risk became such that justoptimistically leaving the hare in hand (as chimpanzees seem-ingly do) was no longer an effective strategy. That is to say,the situation was such that giving up the hare was no longerso cheap that one should just go for the stag without at-tempting to coordinate decisions with other potential hunters.As in the case of sharing the spoils, social selection basedon reputation almost certainly played a role in all of this aswell—but in this case, not for individuals who were tolerantaround food and fair at sharing the spoils but rather forcompetent coordinators and communicators who would in-crease the likelihood of success. Clearly, humans’ skills ofcoordination and communication increased continuously af-ter their initial emergence—from pointing and pantomimingto conventional languages—and the hypothesis is simply thatbetter coordinators and communicators were chosen as col-laborative partners more often. In general, as humans wentfrom more passive scavenging to more active collaborativeforaging, they were faced with ever more challenging coor-dination situations and decisions, and this provided the se-lective context for the evolution of ever greater skills of co-ordination and communication.2. This may help to explain the surprising fact that chimpanzees huntmore frequently for monkeys in the rainy season, when their fruit andother options are actually more plentiful (perhaps because the cost ofunsuccessful monkey hunting is lower; Watts and Mitani 2002).Temptations to Free RideIn Stag Hunt situations with no excess of labor available (allindividuals present are needed for success), free riding is notpossible: if I do not participate, then I (and everyone else)get nothing. The proposal is thus that the earliest manifes-tations of human collaborative foraging were not so vulner-able to free riding because they involved very small numbersof collaborators, each of whom believed their participationto be necessary. Interestingly, contemporary children seem tohave virtually no interest in free riding, as participating incollaborations seems to be rewarding in itself (Gra¨fenhain etal. 2009).So how does it work in chimpanzee hunting of monkeys,when there are often excess participants around? As notedabove, the main factor in acquiring meat in chimpanzee huntsis being the captor. But, in addition, Boesch (1994) reportsthat individuals get more meat when they are actually in thehunt than if they are either bystanders or latecomers to theparty—suggesting the possibility that meat is divided basedon participation. But bystanders still get plenty of meat (83%of bystanders in Taı¨ get at least some meat), and they getmore than latecomers. This suggests that the main variablein obtaining meat is proximity to the kill at the key moment,with the captor getting most, those in the immediate vicinitygetting next most, and latecomers getting least—a hypothesisreceiving strong support from a recent experiment (Melis etal. 2011b). Boesch also reports that of the hunters who arenot captors, the one who obtains the most meat is the onewho best anticipates the monkey’s escape route—but theytend to be both close to the kill site and also older individualswho command more meat in general. Interestingly, inBoesch’s (1994) similar analysis of the hunting of the Gombechimpanzees, bystanders actually get more meat than hunters.So, overall, hunting chimpanzees would seem to have eitherno, or very poor, mechanisms for controlling free riders, lead-ing Boesch (1994:660) to ask: “Why do so many individualscheat, and why are they so readily accepted by hunters?”Another interesting situation is that the individual whobegins chasing the monkey is not the one most likely to cap-ture it (Boesch 1994). This could easily undermine groupaction altogether, as each individual lags to avoid being thefirst chaser. But it does not, and this is instructive of theprocess. The key is that at least one individual would ratherbe the dispreferred first chaser than for there to be no huntat all. That is, some individual must reason that if I do notact soon, no one will get anything—and I would prefer toget something, even if it is less than maximal (and even asmall amount of meat is valuable because it contains vitalmicronutrients; Tennie, Gilby, and Mundry 2009b). In gametheory, this is the Snowdrift situation, with as many equilibriaas participants who reason in this way. Interestingly, in theTaı¨ chimpanzees, it is most often youngsters who begin thechase, perhaps because they have yet to learn that the firstchaser is disadvantaged (whereas the older individuals knowThis content downloaded from 128.243.002.141 on January 25, 2016 04:25:49 AMAll use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).Tomasello et al. Interdependence Hypothesis 679this, and so lag a bit). But it also might be because youngstersare typically more impulsive, impatient, and risk prone thanare adults.So what do humans do about free riders? The answer is,of course, social selection by means of reputation. Humanshave evolved extremely sensitive cheater-detection mecha-nisms of a type never observed in chimpanzees or other greatapes (no studies have investigated apes’ partner choice withrespect to free riders)—which lead them not only to shunfree riders but sometimes even to punish them (Cosmides1989). Because everyone knows this to be the case, individualsare very concerned that others not think them to be laggards,and so they have developed a concern for self-reputation,something also never observed in other great apes. Manyexperiments clearly demonstrate that humans’ concern fortheir own reputation is an important incentive for coopera-tion in many situations in which free riding would otherwisebe beneficial (Milinski, Semmann, and Krambeck 2002). Ingeneral, to the degree that collaborative foraging becomesobligate for survival, a reputation as a good collaborativepartner becomes obligate as well.A mechanism related to reputation and self-reputation ispunishment. So far we have simply assumed that individualschoose partners with good reputations and avoid those withbad reputations. But there is also the possibility of punishingthose who do not cooperate (or rewarding those who do),presumably both to encourage their cooperation on the spotand also to improve their behavior for future collaborations—and indeed such punishment has been shown to be effectivein helping to enforce cooperation in various economic games(Boyd 2006). Humans sometimes even mete out third-partypunishment against those harming others (when they them-selves are not being harmed), whereas chimpanzees—eventhough they retaliate against those who harm them directly(Jensen, Call, and Tomasello 2007b)—do not (Riedl et al.2012).3 When humans are punishing a noncooperator, theytypically experience resentment or moral anger, which goesbeyond normal anger because it seems justified.And so, lagging or free riding would not have been muchof a problem for early humans foraging together in pairs ortrios, where the participation of all is necessary for successand where lack of participation would be easily noted andcount against reputation. When the collaboration is obligate,the stakes are raised to the degree that there may be evencompetition for partners, and in this case a concern for self-reputation would be especially important. Note that by thispoint, reputation means both (i) a more motivated collabo-rator who will not cheat either by monopolizing the food orby lagging and (ii) a more skillful collaborator who is betterable to form joint goals and coordinate roles. What enables3. Chimpanzees sometimes intervene in the fights of others (so-calledpolicing; Flack et al. 2006). However, they are not in these interventionspunishing particular individuals for bad behavior, but only attemptingto keep a dangerous (for them) situation of conflict from escalating.good collaborators to find one another is thus not reputationfor altruism or anything else external, but simply reputationfor being a good collaborator—which is, with actual partnersand direct observers, impossible to fake.Interdependence and Altruistic HelpingHelping one’s partner during a mutualistic collaborative ac-tivity pays direct dividends. If my partner has dropped orbroken his spear, it is in my interest to help him to find orrepair it, as this will improve our chances for success towardour joint goal (and he has no incentive to now suddenlydefect, as the mutualistic situation is still operative). Mutu-alistic collaboration thus provides a safe context within whichbasic tendencies to help others could evolve (see Silk 2009).It is thus not surprising that when Ache foragers are hunting,they do such things for their partners as give them weapons,clear trails for them, carry their child, repair their weapon,instruct them in best techniques, and so on (Hill 2002). In-terestingly, young children, but not chimpanzees, help othersmore readily in the context of collaborative activities thanoutside of such activities (Greenberg et al. 2010; Hamann,Warneken, and Tomasello 2012).But humans help one another outside of collaborative ac-tivities as well. Indeed, in experimental settings, infants asyoung as 14 months of age will help adults with all kinds ofproblems, from fetching out-of-reach objects to openingdoors to stacking books (Warneken and Tomasello 2006,2007). Perhaps surprisingly, chimpanzees also help conspe-cifics with their problems in some similar ways (Melis et al.2011b; Warneken et al. 2007). But humans would seem to doit much more frequently and in a much wider array of con-texts, including actively sharing resources and informationmore freely (e.g., informing others of things helpfully andeven teaching them things; see Warneken and Tomasello 2009for a review). Why might this be the case?Our proposal is that obligate collaborative foraging pro-duces interdependence among members of a group, and thisinterdependence makes it in my direct interest to help otherswho might be my future partners. If I can acquire food onlywith the help of a partner, then when potential partners arein trouble, I should help them—even outside of any collab-orative activity. The logic is exactly the same as Hamilton’sequation for kin, as worked out by Roberts (2005) in hisStakeholder model: I should sacrifice to help potential part-ners whensB 1 C.In this equation, as in Hamilton’s, B represents ultimate re-productive benefits, and these must exceed costs, C, when thebenefits are conditioned by the stake, s, I have in the particularpartner (analogous to Hamilton’s coefficient of relatedness).The variable s in the case of collaborative foraging simplyrepresents how important it is for me that an individual cur-rently in trouble be alive and well and ready to collaborateThis content downloaded from 128.243.002.141 on January 25, 2016 04:25:49 AMAll use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).680 Current Anthropology Volume 53, Number 6, December 2012with me in the future.4 To be a bit fanciful, if a particularindividual’s survival will lead to me to be successful in for-aging to the tune of 1.3 more offspring in the future (e.g.,because it will help me to live longer), then it will pay forme to sacrifice for her to the tune of 1.2 fewer offspring forme in the future. The same logic holds for many other be-haviors in social groups, of course, so that if an alarm callerbenefits my reproductive fitness, I should help her whenneeded. Clutton-Brock (2002) proposes a generalized versionof this mechanism called group augmentation: if my pros-perity depends on my social group (for defense against pred-ators, etc.), then it is in my interest to keep them alive andprosperous as well.The process is, then, a form of social selection: I help otherswho do things that benefit me (more than my help costs me).But the scenario we are proposing here is special. It is specialbecause if I have a stake in an alarm caller and so help her,then what I am socially selecting for is better alarm callers(who have keen perception, loud vocalizations, etc.). Butwhen the target domain is collaboration, then what is beingsocially selected for is good collaborators—who are tolerantof others in cofeeding situations, skillful at coordination andcommunication, have a tendency to shun or punish free rid-ers, help their partners, and so on.Of course, this account still has a problem of free ridingbecause one can lag on the helping: my highest preference isthat someone else help my potential collaborative partner oralarm-calling groupmate so that I do not have to bear thecosts. But as Zahavi (2003) points out, the same is true ofkin selection: it is in my interest to help my sibling becausehe shares my genes, but my first preference is that someoneelse help him so that I do not have to bear the costs. Thepoint is not that interdependence as described by the Stake-holder model solves the problem of altruism but that, usingthe same logic as kin selection, it changes the math becausemy selfish benefits depend on the well-being of selected others.Obligate collaborative foraging thus creates a logic of in-terdependence, which leads to the selective helping of thosewho will be needed as collaborative partners in the future. Itis noteworthy that whereas almost all other accounts of theevolution of human altruism rest on one or another form ofreciprocity, reciprocity cannot explain uncontingent acts ofaltruistic helping. The current account, in contrast, does notdepend on reciprocity because I am repaid for my altruisticacts not by reciprocated altruistic acts from others, but ratherby their later mutualistic collaboration, which costs themnothing (actually benefits them). Indeed, it has recently beendemonstrated experimentally that humans will actually com-pete with one another to be more altruistic so that observers4. The process is thus similar to what has been called pseudoreciprocity(e.g., Bshary and Bergmu¨ller 2008), in which one individual “invests” inanother, who does nothing contingent in return but just what she nor-mally would do in such circumstances.will later choose them to engage in a mutualistic collaboration(Sylwester and Roberts 2010).5SummaryBonobos, gorillas, and orangutans do not collaboratively for-age at all. Only some chimpanzees do so and then in onlyone of their many foraging activities. And the data we havepresented suggest that when chimpanzees do hunt in smallgroups for monkeys, they do this with cognitive and moti-vational mechanisms not specifically evolved for the task, thatis, they somehow manage to be successful quite often in spiteof their tendencies toward dominance in solving food dis-putes. In contrast, humans, as already evident in young chil-dren, have evolved a suite of cognitive and motivational mech-anisms for sharing food cooperatively, coordinating andcommunicating toward joint goals with complementary roles,and engaging in various kinds of reputation-based social se-lection (including a concern for self-reputation as a coop-erator)—what we have called skills and motivations for jointintentionality. They seem evolved for the task. Table 1 sum-marizes the basic mechanisms involved.Our evolutionary story so far has been highly selective. Asnoted at the outset, we have backgrounded the important roleof kinship, as humans evolved more stable reproductive bonds(resulting in an increase in male tolerance), which obviouslyplayed an important role in the attitudes of individuals towardone another in small groups (Chapais 2008). Further in thiscontext, humans also became cooperative breeders, regularlyproviding child care for offspring who were not their own,and this clearly would have affected emotions and motivationsfor collaboration and altruism as well (Hrdy 2009). Mostlikely, both of these processes played a key role in the earlieststages of the story we are telling here, as humans were be-coming more tolerant with one another around food. But, asalso argued at the outset, these kinds of processes, importantas they are, would not help us to explain the more cognitiveaspects of coordinating and communicating toward jointgoals, nor would they explain humans’ tendency to sociallyselect others with regard to their cooperative behaviors. Toexplain these, we need not just prosocial tendencies, but jointintentional skills and motivations for various kinds of col-laboration.And so a big first step in the evolution of uniquely humancooperation is one in which the usual suspects—kin selection,sexual selection, direct reciprocity, and indirect reciprocity—play only minor roles. The heroes of our story are (1) mu-tualistic collaboration and the logic of interdependence and(2) social selection based on reputation as a good collaborator.5. Note that if two thieves are totally interdependent—the first needsthe second to pick the lock, and the second needs the first to crack thesafe—and this is the only way they can get resources for food, then whenthe police question them, there is no Prisoner’s Dilemma. Neither wantsto be set free on his own while the other stays in jail because this wouldmean starvation.This content downloaded from 128.243.002.141 on January 25, 2016 04:25:49 AMAll use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).Tomasello et al.

There was still someway to go to get to human large-group cooperation and itscomplex conventions, norms, and institutions.Second Step: Group-MindednessSmall-scale obligate collaborative foraging would seem to bea stable form of cooperation: it is in the enlightened self-interest of individuals to collaborate well with others and tohelp their collaborative partners. But, apparently, at somepoint it was not stable, as evidenced by the fact that contem-porary humans possess a whole other level of mechanismsfor cooperation, including social conventions, norms (inter-nalized into guilt and shame), and institutions, along with astrong in-group bias. Why did these become necessary?We think there were two, essentially demographic, factors:population growth within groups, and competition betweengroups. These factors probably began playing a role with theemergence of behaviorally modern humans. Thus, Foley andGamble (2009) argue and present evidence (mostly frompaleo- and modern genetics) that in the Middle Pleistocene,hominin groups (characteristic of the first step of our story)had relatively small effective population sizes. In contrast, Hilland Hurtado (2009) argue and present evidence that a tran-sition to larger social groups with central-place foraging—and comprising a hierarchical structure in which “bands”coalesce into “tribes” or “societies”—took place basically withmodern humans and the advent of behavioral modernity (i.e.,at the time of our second step). The result was two new setsof challenges to human cooperators:Large-group coordination: as groups became larger, at leastpartly in competition with other groups, individuals neededto be able to coordinate with relative strangers—while stillknowing that they were from within the group (and so hadthe requisite skills and trustworthiness).Large-group social selection: as groups became larger, againdue partly to competition with other groups, incentives forcooperation diminished (each individual was less needed, andreputational information was more difficult to obtain; Olson1965), so free riding—and even active cheating—proliferatedand needed to be controlled.With these large-group processes, we have pretty much leftthe domain of factors important in the lives of nonhumangreat apes. But still, a comparison of humans’ and great apes’proximate mechanisms for meeting these two challenges isinstructive for the question of origins. Also instructive is thefact that human children do not participate in group-mindedthings such as social norms and institutions until some timeafter they have learned to collaborate effectively with othersin concrete tasks—giving at least some indirect support toour hypothesized evolutionary sequence of collaboration be-fore group-mindedness.Large-Group Coordination: Cultural Practices andGroup IdentificationIf collaboration is the horizontal dimension of human culture,as adults interact with one another for mutual benefit, thencultural transmission is its vertical dimension, as adults passalong things to children across generations. Cultural trans-mission was very likely an important part of human sociallife from the beginning of the genus Homo, as subsistenceactivities became more complex and the use of tools becamemore important. Being a good social learner was thus goodfor individual fitness and, indeed, even chimpanzees andorangutans socially learn from others in ways that create be-havioral traditions that persist across generations (van Schaiket al. 2003; Whiten et al. 1999).But when social groups become larger, and the target ofsocial learning is collaborative activities in which each par-ticipant must have some skills and trustworthiness to be agood partner, a new set of issues arise. The problem for theindividual is to know who has the requisite skills and trust-worthiness and, reciprocally, to make sure that others knowthat I myself possess these qualities.

Contemporary humans havemany diverse ways of doing this, but one can imagine thatthe original ways were mainly behavioral: people who talklike me, prepare food like me, and net fish in the conventionalway—that is, those who share my cultural practices—are verylikely members of my society. And I know that others arescrutinizing my cultural practices in this same manner.Cultural practices are different from behavioral traditionsbecause their practitioners understand them as “shared” inthe group; that is, they understand them as conventional. Wehave all “agreed” to do them in a particular way, even thoughwe all know that there are other ways we could do them. Itis thus common ground in the society that everyone expectseveryone else both to behave in the conventional way and toexpect others to behave in the conventional way (Lewis 1969).Conventions thus require some kind of recursive mindreadingor common ground as the basis of the agreement, and thisbasic ability evolved initially, as argued above, as a skill forforming joint goals and joint attention in collaborative activ-ities.6 Our hypothesis is that because of this cognitive re-quirement, other great apes do not have human-like conven-tions or cultural practices as such (only behavioral traditions;Tomasello 2008, 2011).Conventions generate the conformity characteristic of cul-tural practices because it is in the individual’s interest to dothings the way that others do them so that they can effectivelycoordinate—and this is especially important if one wishes tobe able to coordinate with anyone in the larger society, in-cluding strangers. I can immediately net fish effectively andefficiently with an in-group stranger if we both do it in theconventional way and can expect the partner to do it in theconventional way as well. In this connection, it is interestingthat human children are much more conformist than areother great apes. Thus, two decades of experimental researchhave shown that human children have a much stronger ten-dency than do other apes to copy the actual actions theyobserve (Tennie, Call, and Tomasello 2009a). This tendencyis so strong that both adults and children conform to otherseven when they know better themselves (Asch 1956; Haunand Tomasello 2011; see also Lyons, Young, and Keil 2007,on children’s tendency to overimitate). Most directly, whenindividuals solve some task on their own and then see otherindividuals demonstrating a different solution, apes tend togo with their own experience over the demonstration (Hru-besch, Preuschoft, and van Schaik 2009; Marshall-Pescini and6. Problems with the proper formulation of mutual knowledge andsimilar constructs are well known. Here we simply adopt the terminologyof Clark (1996), “common ground,” to indicate the various forms ofjoint attention, mutual expectations, mutual knowledge, etc.Whiten 2008),7 whereas human children follow the demon-stration.In addition to pressure from growing population sizes toconform to cultural practices, competition with other groupshelped to engender group identification. In the face of groupcompetition, group life in general becomes one big collabo-rative activity, both directly for agonistic conflicts with com-petitor groups and indirectly in competing for resources withcompetitors in the same geographical area. To compete, thesociety as a whole—especially as population increased andthere was increasing division of labor—had to scale up itssmall-scale collaboration to form collective, society-widegoals, plans, and collective knowledge of things in the face ofoutside threats. And individuals again had to help their col-laborative partners for these group enterprises—who at thispoint comprised essentially everyone in the society, includingsome strangers.Under these conditions—within-group population growthand between-group competition—group identification thusbecame critical. Group identification may seem a fuzzy con-cept, but many phenomena confirm its reality, most especially,the many in-group biases that modern humans show (helpingin-group more than out-group members, caring more aboutreputation with in-group than with out-group members, etc.).Even more striking, people feel collective guilt, pride, orshame when some member of their group does somethingespecially praiseworthy or blameworthy—as if they them-selves had done it (see Bennet and Sani 2008 for this phe-nomenon in young children). Although the process may notbe so well understood, the idea is that group identification isa scaled-up version of the “we” intentionality that small-scalegroups of foragers might have experienced previously as theyhunted or gathered collaboratively toward a joint goal. “We”are all in this together and are interdependent with one an-other, as we compete for food with the barbarians from acrossthe river. This psychological attitude may be called group-mindedness—underlain by skills and motivations not just ofjoint intentionality with other individuals in the moment, butof collective intentionality with the society as a whole (Tom-asello and Rakoczy 2003).8As far as we know, great apes do not have this same kindof group identity or group-mindedness. Chimpanzees live inspatially segregated groups and are hostile toward chimpanzeestrangers they meet on their borders. But this hostility is not,7. Whiten, Horner, and de Waal (2005) claimed that in their study,individuals of a chimpanzee group shifted their problem-solving strategyas a result of observing demonstrators. A close inspection of the data,however, shows that this was true of only one individual. Moreover, asubsequent study with a different chimpanzee group failed to replicatethis result (Hopper et al. 2007).8. Interestingly, social psychologists often distinguish two broad typesof group formation in humans: interpersonal interdependence (corre-sponding to our small-group interdependence) and shared identity (cor-responding to our large-group group-mindedness; e.g., Lickel, Schmader,and Spanovic 2007).This content downloaded from 128.243.002.141 on January 25, 2016 04:25:49 AMAll use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).Tomasello et al. Interdependence Hypothesis 683as far as we know, directed at other groups qua groups, basedon their different appearance or behavioral practices.Large-Group Social Selection: Social Norms and InstitutionsCultural practices are thus conventionalizations (standardi-zations) of the small-scale collaborative (and other) activitiesof step 1 humans. Similarly, the acts of social selection bystep 1 humans were also conventionalized, leading, at step 2,to social norms. Social norms are conventionalizations (stan-dardizations) of the specific acts of social judgment that step1 individuals meted out to collaborative partners. Socialnorms are mutual expectations in common ground that peo-ple behave in certain ways, where the expectations are notjust statistical but rather normative, as in you are expectedto do your part (or else!).Social norms have two key aspects. First is their force. Socialnorms have force over human behavior because, first of all,individuals know that to participate effectively in the collab-orative activities of the group, they must conform to thegroup’s ways of doing things. Even young children enter newsituations in their culture looking for “What am I supposedto do here? How do I do it?” (Kalish 1998). In addition, ofcourse, individuals do not want to suffer the consequencesof norm violations in the form of shunning or punishment.These punitive aspects of social selection were already a partof collaborative activities at step 1 of our story, but now, withtheir conventionalization, everyone knows with everyone elsein common ground that conforming to cultural practices andsocial norms is necessary for group coordination—so thatgroup members may view nonconformity in general as po-tentially harmful to group life in general. Moreover, if con-forming to social norms also displays my group identity(which, again, we all know in common ground), my non-conformity expresses my disdain for the opinion of this groupand for being considered a member of this group—whichmakes me potentially dangerous.Social norms can thus channel human behavior quitestrongly in certain directions. The theoretical problem is thatsocial norms can, in principle, channel human behavior inany direction, including group-detrimental directions (Boyd2006). But this potential multidirectionality is only a problemif we envision social norms emerging in a vacuum. In ourview, because of humans’ already existing cooperative lifewaysand interdependence as evolved in step 1, social norms couldnot have emerged as directionally arbitrary, but only as en-couraging collaboration and helping and as discouraging theiropposites—since, to repeat, social norms are nothing morethan conventionalizations of the more particular acts of socialselection for cooperative behavior (and against uncooperativebehavior) of step 1 individuals. Under conditions of groupcompetition, social norms may be scaled up to the level ofsocietal life in general.The second key aspect of social norms is their generality.They are general, first, because they imply an objective stan-dard against which an individual’s behavior is evaluated andjudged. These objective standards come from the fact that weall know in common ground how the different roles in par-ticular cultural practices need to be performed for everyoneto reap the anticipated benefit. Thus, if it is common groundin the group that when collecting honey, the person smokingout the bees must do it in this particular way and that if shedoes not, we will all go home empty-handed, then everyone’sbehavior may be evaluated relative to this mutually knownbehavioral standard. Social norms are general, second, becausethey emanate not from individual opinion but from groupopinion. Thus, if dominance is not an important part of thesocial interaction of the beings we are talking about here, thenthe punishment of the laggard needs to be by the group as awhole—so that when an individual enforces a social norm,she is doing so, in effect, as an emissary of the group as awhole (with even further objectification of the norm comingif the enforcer is supposedly a representative of a deity). Thethird source of generality of social norms is that the groupdisapproval involved is aimed in an agent-neutral way at, inprinciple, all individuals equally (including the self), that is,all who know with us in common ground the social normand identify with our group’s lifeways. Social norms are thusgroup expectations and judgments, with respect to group-known standards, that all group members mutually expectone another to respect.9It is thus easy to see why people follow social norms—following social norms coordinates their behavior with thenormative expectations of the group so as to collaborate betterand avoid punishment and/or shunning. But the reason whypeople enforce social norms is not as straightforward. Onereason is again a natural tendency to want to help and protectone’s collaborative partners and, in the spirit of group-mind-edness, the smooth functioning of the group. When we enterinto a joint commitment to a social norm, group-mindedthinking means that we commit not only to follow it but tosee that others do too—for the benefit of both ourselves andthose with whom we are interdependent (Gilbert 1989). Thus,when 3-year-old children observe someone doing somethingthat violates a previously established conventional norm, theyoften object, using normative language about what peopleshould or ought to be doing (Rakoczy, Warneken, and Tom-asello 2008). Nonconformists are not doing things the waythat “we” in this group do them, and this is, in a sense, athreat to our group.Nevertheless, there is still the problem that punishing otherson behalf of the group is costly and risky, and so there is theproblem of free riding: why not let someone else do it? Onesolution would be to punish those who do not punish othersas they should. This, of course, leads to an infinite regress iffollowed to its logical conclusion: individuals punishing non-9. The common-ground assumption exempts from the force of oursocial norms individuals from another social group, young children, ormentally incompetent persons.This content downloaded from 128.243.002.141 on January 25, 2016 04:25:49 AMAll use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).684 Current Anthropology Volume 53, Number 6, December 2012punishers of nonpunishers, and so forth. And this is wheresocial norms help: recent mathematical models show thatwhen it is a group that is punishing, costs to the individualpunisher may be negligible (Boyd, Gintis, and Bowles 2010).Another part of the solution is that we do not sanction peoplewho fail to enforce norms in the same way that we sanctionnorm violators themselves. If you see me trying to steal somehoney, you will either try to stop me or punish me. But if athird person watches you not trying to stop me or punishme, her attitude toward you, the nonenforcer, while negative,is not nearly so severe—and may not call for punishment atall. In the model of Ellickson (2001), we punish norm vio-lators, but we simply avoid or shun nonpunishers, which ispotentially cost free (a mathematical treatment of the problemthat goes in this general direction is presented by Pancha-nathan and Boyd 2004).Moreover, in practice, enforcing social norms is mostly notnecessary because individuals have already internalized themand naturally want to conform to them. And if individualsdo violate a norm, they often punish themselves. Thus, if, ina moment of weakness, I take some honey that is needed byothers, I will very likely feel guilty. The feeling of guilt is akind of self-punishment that functions to prevent me fromdoing it again in the future, lessening the chances of actualpunishment (or shunning) from others. In addition, display-ing guilt to others, if caught, signals that I know the norm,that I know I should have followed it, and that I am punishingmyself for its violation already (hopefully evoking your em-pathy)—which all means that I am indeed a cooperative groupmember and norm-follower who just had a momentary lapse(see Vaish, Carpenter, and Tomasello 2011 for evidence thateven young children prefer individuals who display guilt fortheir transgressions). Shame is not bound up with harm inthe same way as guilt, but it is also a form of self-punishment(Fessler 2004 emphasizes its appeasement function). I amashamed that I wore the wrong clothing to the wedding, andmy blushing displays that I know the norm and that I shouldhave followed it, so you don’t have to shun or punish me,and you can trust me to do better in the future.Guilt, shame, and pride are thus internalized versions of thekind of moral indignation and approbation that humans meteout to others who violate social norms. These norm-relatedemotions thus demonstrate with special clarity that the judg-ment being made is not my personal feeling about things butrather the group’s. I am sanctioning myself or praising myselfas an emissary of the group. I stole the honey because I wantedit, and I still like having it, but I feel guilty. I, as a representativeof the group’s values, am judging myself, as an individual,negatively. It is almost certainly the case that the individuals ofno other animal species judge and evaluate themselves in thisway. And, as noted above, collective guilt and pride for thegroup (based on the behavior of individuals as representativesof the group) are perforce uniquely human as well.Pretty much all of the cooperative mechanisms character-istic of humans at this second step in our evolutionary storycome together in the creation of social institutions. Socialinstitutions are collaborative cultural practices with joint goalsand standardized roles, with social norms governing how re-wards are dispensed, how cheaters and free riders are treated,and so on. What is new about institutions is that they createnew statuses for individuals playing particular roles that ev-eryone must respect; for example, we give individuals therights and obligations to be group “chief,” and we give “po-lice” the rights and obligations necessary to keep within-grouppeace. These new statuses exist because and only becauseeveryone agrees in common ground that they do; becauseinstitutions are especially clearly public, no one may ignorethe new statuses by pleading ignorance of them (Chwe 2003).These status functions (as Searle 1995 calls them) are essen-tially entitlements: the group has, in essence, agreed that anindividual can and indeed should do certain specified thingsimmune from punishment via “normal” social norms. Thesestatuses are typically symbolically marked with all kinds ofofficial markers, and their ontological status is prefigured on-togenetically in young children pretending socially that, forexample, this stick is a bird that can fly through the air as itpleases (Rakoczy and Tomasello 2007).SummaryThe dynamics of small-scale collaboration worked fine forforaging in dyads and triads of the moment. But as groupsbecame larger, eventually turning into tribal societies, andgroups started competing with one another for resources, newchallenges to cooperation arose. The solution was a suite ofnew proximate mechanisms that we may summarize with theterm “group-mindedness.” Behavioral traditions were con-ventionalized into cultural practices that everyone knew andthat everyone expected everyone else to know and conformto, which facilitated individuals’ coordination with in-groupstrangers. Social selection was conventionalized into group-wide social norms, which were also part of the commonground of the group, as was the group-wide obligation toenforce these norms. People used conformity to the culturalpractices and social norms of the society as markers of groupidentity, and everyone favored and trusted members of theirown society over others, especially as group competitionheightened. The result was a new kind of interdependenceand group-mindedness that went well beyond the joint in-tentionality of small-scale cooperation to a kind of collectiveintentionality at the level of the entire societal, that is, cultural,group (Tomasello and Rakoczy 2003). Interestingly and im-portantly, young children do not begin to show this kind ofgroup-mindedness and collective intentionality—in particu-lar, they do not enforce social norms on others—until after3 years of age, which is considerably after they are capable ofcollaborating with other individuals toward joint goals, as instep 1 of our story (Rakoczy, Warneken, and Tomasello 2008).Cultural group selection may have played an importantrole at this point as well, as some groups created culturalThis content downloaded from 128.243.002.141 on January 25, 2016 04:25:49 AMAll use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).Tomasello et al.

But, as noted at the outset, cultural group selectionexplains why the particular social norms and institutions ofparticular cultural groups prevailed, and this assumes species-universal skills and motivations for creating social norms andinstitutions in the first place. We thus view cultural groupselection as a critically important component in the processleading to modern human cooperation in large-scale societies,but only fairly late in the process, that is, after our secondstep, in which human groups began their truly cultural lifein larger societies. In any case, a summary of the specificproximate mechanisms and group processes involved in step2 of our account, and some of their possible evolutionaryprecursors in other great apes, is presented in table 2.ConclusionModern theories of the evolution of human cooperation tendto focus either on small-scale cooperation early in humanevolution or on group-level cooperation later in the processwith the advent of modern humans (or even later, with ag-riculture). We believe, however, that the full story will requirean account that incorporates both of these levels and evo-lutionary periods.Small-group collaboration, in our account, is not solelyabout kinship and reciprocity, as in most accounts, thoughthese undoubtedly played some role. Kinship and reciprocityare important in the lives of almost all primates, so if theywere the whole story, it would be hard to see how humanscame to their distinctive lifeways and social organization. Kin-ship and reciprocity do not get you culture. Instead, we havehypothesized a change of ecology that led humans to an in-terdependent lifestyle, especially collaborative foraging, whichresulted in the evolution of new skills and motivations forcollaborating with others (joint intentionality) and gave in-dividuals special incentives for helping their partners altru-istically as well. The emergence of more stable reproductivebonds and cooperative breeding undoubtedly played impor-tant roles in the emotional-motivational side of things at thisearly period as well, but contrary to what is implied by Burkartand van Schaik (2010), we do not believe that if chimpanzeesbecame cooperative breeders that human-like social-cognitiveskills and shared intentionality would automatically result.What is needed, in addition, is new cognitive challenges suchas those presented by collaborative foraging: the need to co-ordinate with others toward joint goals, the need to masterwith others complex skills and technologies, and the need tocommunicate these skills and technologies to others withinand across generations. In our view, cooperative child carefits in very well with a lifestyle of collaborative foraging, sothe cooperative breeding and cooperative foraging accountsgo very well together.Group-level cooperation was then built upon the cognitiveand motivational foundations of small-scale collaboration.Creating cultural conventions, norms, and institutions at thelevel of the social group as a whole requires a new way ofthinking in which there is a “we” that constitutes not just mycurrent partners in a collaborative enterprise but all of us inthis society. This new way of thinking—that we are a “we”—very likely evolved in response to group competition, as eachgroup had to “circle its wagons.” Group-mindedness thusrelies on a kind of collective intentionality in which all mem-bers of the group participate, both following and enforcingthe norms that define the group and stabilize its cooperativeactivities. At this point, cultural group selection undoubtedlyplayed an important role as well. But it could play that roleonly after humans had evolved the kind of group-mindednessthat is the mark of human cultural organization in the firstplace. Thus, cultural group selection cannot help us muchwith the cognitive dimension of human collaboration—whichat this level means the creation of cultural conventions,norms, and institutions—which is the target of cultural groupselection, not its creation.And so, for us, it is all about the evolution of a distinctivelynew, un-chimp-like lifestyle that required both emotional-motivational and cognitive adaptations. The key ecologicalchange was one that made individual human beings inter-dependent with one another for subsistence, which led nat-urally to helping those on whom one was dependent. Thisrequired the development of cognitive skills for putting one’shead together with others in acts of mutualistic collaborationand communication. It also required individuals suppressingcertain selfish tendencies, for example, for hogging all thespoils or for free riding on the efforts of others.

Inorder to be chosen, one needs to appear to others to be agood partner, and the best way to do that is to actually be agood partner—which means good cognitive skills for coor-dination and communication, sharing the spoils peacefullywith others, shunning and punishing noncooperators, con-cerns for self-reputation as a cooperator, and so forth. Thislogic of interdependence and resulting social selection scalesup to the level of the whole society if all of its members areinterdependent because they are in competition with othergroups and so have become group-minded.This account is, of course, speculative. Ethnographies ofmodern-day foragers may not be representative of the earlierperiods in human evolution in which we are interested, andthe paleo-anthropological record is far from definitive on anyof the important issues. We have thus supplemented these tra-ditional anthropological forms of evidence with comparativeexperimental data on similarities and differences in the skillsand motivations for cooperation between contemporary hu-man children and other great apes. Here the data are quiteclear that contemporary humans have some specific skills andmotivations for collaboration and cooperative communicationnot possessed by other great apes, at least not in the same way.And, importantly, these can be theoretically connected to thespecific challenges presented by collaborative foraging—as rep-resented by the Stag Hunt from game theory—which providesfurther evidence for collaborative foraging as a key context forthe evolution of uniquely human skills and motivations forcooperation and shared intentionality.In any case, what the current account makes abundantlyclear is just how difficult it is to establish and maintain co-operation in complex social organisms. Humans have all kindsof species-unique skills and motivations specifically designedto support cooperation, but still we are very, very far fromperfect cooperators. Cooperation is really difficult.AcknowledgmentWe thank Anna-Claire Schneider for her help with this paper.CommentsIan C.

(ian.gilby@duke.edu). 16 V 12I applaud Tomasello et al. for highlighting the role of mu-tualism in the evolution of human cooperation. In chimpan-zees and bonobos, which often serve as models of the lastcommon ancestor of apes and humans, the importance ofmutualism is often overlooked in favor of altruism-basedmechanisms common in the genus Homo. Mutualism explainsthe majority of non-kin cooperation in the animal kingdom(Dugatkin 1997); therefore, it is critical to understand its rolein the development of the uniquely high levels of cooperationin humans. With this said, I must make it clear that I am notarguing that altruism-based cooperation is entirely absent innonhuman primates. Indeed, several studies have providedexperimental and correlational evidence for reciprocal ex-change, albeit typically characterized by short delays and lowcosts (Clutton-Brock 2009). However, I feel that mutualisticexplanations for cooperation in chimpanzees and bonoboshave not received research attention in proportion to theirbiological importance.I study hunting and meat-sharing among wild chimpanzeesin two East African communities—Kasekela (Gombe NationalPark, Tanzania) and Kanyawara (Kibale National Park,Uganda), and I would like to echo the authors’ emphasis onthe mutualistic nature of group hunts of red colobus monkeysat these sites. In fact, I argue that group hunting by chim-panzees may be even simpler than Tomasello et al. claim.They use the game-theoretical model of the Stag Hunt as atool for understanding chimpanzee hunting. In the most im-portant respect, this is a valid approach—as the number ofhunters increases, each individual has a greater chance ofobtaining meat. Thus, there is selection on the individual toparticipate, as long as others are already doing so. However,Tomasello et al. point out that the Stag Hunt hinges on theassumption that “all solo alternatives must be forsaken(risked) in order to collaborate,” which is clearly not the casein a chimpanzee hunt. The alternative prey (vegetation) re-mains a viable option if a hunt fails. In fact, the existence ofa high-quality alternative food source (ripe drupe fruits) in-creases hunting probability at Kanyawara, even after the con-comitant occurrence of large groups is controlled for (Gilbyand Wrangham 2007). Thus, it would seem that the costs ofhunting (at least with regard to missed alternative foragingopportunities) are negligible.As an alternative to the Stag Hunt, Richard Wrangham,Richard Connor, and I have argued that group hunting bychimpanzees may be driven by a simple by-product mutu-alism (Gilby and Connor 2010; Gilby, Eberly, and Wrangham2008) by which each individual’s selfish actions incidentallybenefit others (Brown 1983). Each male hunts for himself butexperiences an increased chance of success when others hunt.There is growing evidence that certain males act as huntingcatalysts by being the first to act. At both Kanyawara (Gilby,Eberly, and Wrangham 2008) and Gombe (Gilby, Pusey, andWilson, forthcoming), hunts were significantly more likely tooccur if at least one of two particular males was present whena party encountered red colobus than if both were absent.This suggests that once one of these “impact males” beginshunting, the prey’s defenses are compromised, reducing thepotential costs for other hunters.This content downloaded from 128.243.002.141 on January 25, 2016 04:25:49 AMAll use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).Tomasello et al. Interdependence Hypothesis 687Given this evidence in favor of by-product mutualism, Ienthusiastically agree with Tomasello et al. that group huntingby chimpanzees may arise as “an emergent property generatedby individual decision making not aimed at . . . coordination.”I am also particularly pleased at their observation that indi-vidual decision making does not mean that hunting is a madscramble during which all hunters ignore each other. Instead,“in deciding what to do, each participant takes into accountthe position of the others and their behavior, and how thesemight influence the monkey’s flight”—that is, a by-productmutualism may result in differentiated roles (as described atTaı¨ [Boesch 2002]), without involving shared goals and in-tentions.Nevertheless, chimpanzee hunting is probably not as simpleas I have made it out to be in this comment. For example,it is becoming clear that above a certain threshold numberof hunters, when bystanders obtain meat at predictably highrates, individuals refrain from hunting (Gilby, Eberly, andWrangham 2008). This suggests that receiving meat in anyamount is beneficial, probably due to concentrated micro-nutrients (Tennie, Gilby, and Mundry 2009b). Therefore, agreater understanding of the nutritional benefits of meat forchimpanzees will be critical for unraveling the complex dy-namics of group-level foraging in humans’ closest living rel-atives.In sum, while we differ on some of the finer points, Iapplaud the authors’ two-step scenario of the evolution ofhuman cooperation. Their invocation of mutualism in thecontext of cooperative foraging as a step toward altruism-based human cooperation is compelling.Kristen HawkesDepartment of Anthropology, University of Utah, 270 South 1400East, Salt Lake City, Utah 84112, U.S.A. (hawkes@anthro.utah.edu). 29 V 12Stag Hunts or Rearing Environments?Tomasello et al. have made the case that shared intentionalitydistinguishes humans from our nearest living relatives. Whataccounts for the difference? The answer they offer is Stag Huntchoices faced by ancestral foragers. Noting problems with thatanswer, I urge attention to a promising alternative stimulatedby Tomasello et al.’s own findings. It comes from Sarah Hrdy,who posed the question, “Why us and not them?” The answershe nominated is distinctive rearing environments in our lin-eage, with consequences for selection on motives and capac-ities for social engagement at the youngest ages.Tomasello and his collaborators have produced an extensivebody of results from experiments with chimpanzees and hu-man children, demonstrating that very young—even pre-verbal—children display an eagerness for social engagementnot found in our nearest living relatives. As indicated in thepaper here, the experimental evidence gets richer all the time.Building on this and a long history of findings in social phi-losophy and developmental psychology, Tomasello et al. havehypothesized that the evolution of shared intentionality wasa crucial antecedent to human language and the socially con-structed worlds in which we live our cultural lives.If shared intentionality is key to so much, explanations forit become especially important. Here and elsewhere, the ex-planation Tomasello et al. favor is the Stag Hunt. This parableis an assurance game in which cooperation is easily achievedbecause players take the risk of abandoning pursuit of a harethey could capture alone in anticipation of the greater benefitfrom capturing a stag by cooperating (but see Brosnan et al.2011). Here Tomasello and colleagues argue that chimpanzeepursuit of monkeys may also fit the Stag Hunt. But does it?When a chimpanzee leaves a fig tree to join a monkey hunt,the figs don’t run away. Stag-versus-hare alternatives are notobvious for ancestral hominin foragers either. The authorssay the parable “can easily be extended to other foragingactivities, including many gathering activities,” but they donot elaborate. Their examples are big-game hunting in themiddle Pleistocene and scavenging—competitive and pas-sive—before that. Behavior presumed in these cases is barelysketched—perhaps because the exercise is a thought experi-ment. Still, a thought experiment should specify imaginedalternatives. The parable is not a good fit for solitary big-game hunting among living foragers in the arid African tropics(e.g., Hawkes, O’Connell, and Blurton-Jones 2001). Moderntechnology (bows and arrows) likely alters payoffs but doesnot prevent useful application of ethnographic lessons to thehunting and competitive scavenging past (O’Connell et al.2002). As for passive scavenging, where is the stag when theusual gain is only cranial contents and bone marrow thatcan’t run away?Focus on Stag Hunts leaves no space for Hrdy’s (2009)cooperative breeding hypothesis. Although it is mentioned inpassing, her specific arguments about ancestral rearing en-vironments and the evolution of shared intentionality are not.Findings from Tomasello’s own group about the sociality ofvery young children play an important role in her synthesis.Because human mothers, unlike other apes, depend on helpersin child rearing, they have next babies before the previousone is independent. That means maternal concern about thenew infant trades off with concern about potential helpersand other still-dependent offspring. So, human infants, unlikeother apes, cannot count on their mother’s undivided atten-tion. In this rearing environment, the welfare of infants andyoungsters depends heavily on their own ability to engage thecommitment of mothers and others, with selection for thosecapacities especially strong in high-mortality environments.A contender to explain the origin of these rearing envi-ronments is the grandmother hypothesis, favored because itaccounts for distinctive human postmenopausal longevity,later maturity, and shorter birth intervals compared to theother great apes (Blurton Jones, Hawkes, and O’Connell 1999;This content downloaded from 128.243.002.141 on January 25, 2016 04:25:49 AMAll use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).688 Current Anthropology Volume 53, Number 6, December 2012Hawkes 2003; Hawkes et al. 1998; O’Connell, Hawkes, andBlurton Jones 1999). Hrdy’s cooperative breeding hypothesis(2009) casts its comparative net much wider than the apesand does not privilege grandmothers among possible helpers.But most important here is that Hrdy points to selectionpressures on infant sociality that arise from the challengesposed by maternal reliance on help from whatever source.Tomasello and colleagues give indirect support to the priorimportance of rearing environments for our prosociality bysuggesting that developmental timing may be a guide to evo-lutionary sequence. Their own evidence shows distinctive hu-man appetites for mutual orientation and joint activities inchildren much too young to forage—collaboratively or oth-erwise. The early appearance of these motivations and ca-pacities suggests they are adaptations to challenges faced atthose early ages. That developmental timing is directly con-sistent with Hrdy’s proposal that distinctive human proso-ciality began initially as a consequence of the rearing envi-ronments that emerged as ancestral mothers relied enoughon help that they bore the next baby before the previous onecould feed itself.Kim SterelnyPhilosophy Program, Research School of the Social Sciences, Aus-tralian National University, 0200 Canberra, Australian Capital Ter-ritory, Australia (kim.sterelny@anu.edu.au). 10 V 12I agree with the core argument of this paper, having developeda similar argument in Sterelny (2007). So my comments high-light differences in emphasis, not different models of humancooperation. That said, I agree that cooperative foraging wasan early-evolving, central factor in the human cooperationexplosion, but in coevolutionary interaction with reproduc-tive and informational cooperation, rather than being itsprime driver. Even when we focus on ecological cooperation,mutualistic teamwork complements other factors. Coopera-tion generates benefit in two ways: (i) through collective ac-tion in teamwork, as groups of agents secure resources (orescape dangers) that none could secure by themselves and (ii)through risk management. Dispersed search is more efficientthat a band searching together; variation in return is con-trolled if individuals target different resources. Risk manage-ment is important to those with limited storage, so bet hedg-ing, and division of labor (by sex or age) was probably anearly form of cooperation, coevolving with collective foraging.In the early phase of the cooperation explosion, free-ridercontrol was a more pressing problem than the paper supposes.Collective foraging was never a pure coordination problem.Even if hunting (or bully scavenging) teams were originallyso small that every player was needed, there would still be atemptation to minimize the risk costs of participation; not tobe the player closest to the leopard, banging your stick; ornot to be the first to stab at a wildebeest breaking through acordon. Perhaps more important, there are trade-offs betweenredundancy, reliability, and free-riding opportunities. If everyplayer is needed, it takes only one mistake, failure of nerve,or unlucky moment for the hunt to miscarry. Returns willbe fragile. Redundant players make success more robust butopen free-riding opportunities. Sanctions, perhaps throughpartner choice, must have been available close to the begin-ning of cooperation takeoff. These sanctions were not free:exclusion risks making enemies. That risk is never trivial:forager societies are very cooperative, but with very high ratesof interpersonal violence (Seabright 2010).The paper somewhat undersells the role of scavenging instep 1. Lions get much of their food by driving other predatorsfrom their kills, and a pack of erectines with crude spears andgood throwing arms could have driven leopards and the likefrom a kill. Predators cannot afford injury, and a leopard(say) guarding a kill is a stationary target for volleys of thrownrocks. Wrangham (2009) argues persuasively that even ha-bilenes show signs of an improved, richer diet. If so, it islikely that increasingly collaborative, increasingly obligate, col-lective foraging had deep roots in increasingly effective, ag-gressive, scavenging packs. Aggressive scavenging is a plausiblepathway to cooperation because its profits are high while itscognitive preconditions are light: the hominin band must staytogether in a dense pack, make as much noise as possible,throw as hard as they can. Scavenging is not passive (as thepaper notes in passing), but it requires no complex coordi-nation or role differentiation.A final comment: step 2 seems to compress two separatetransitions into one. Group-mindedness seems to haveevolved by the later Pleistocene (perhaps by 75 kya), withmaterial symbols and regional style established in the physicalrecord (Henshilwood and Dubreuil 2011). This “symbolicbehavior” is often interpreted as advertising group member-ship and/or individual status, though these issues are notresolved (Sterelny 2011). However, there seem to be two latePleistocene transitions in social, demographic, and economiccomplexity. One is associated with the emergence of behav-iorally modern humans, perhaps by about 75 kya. The otheris at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, with the emergenceof farming and sedentary life. Only at this point do the factorsthe paper emphasizes become central: groups really did be-come large enough so that cooperating with strangers becamea real issue, just at the time that competition between groupsintensified (Seabright 2010). Despite Bowles’s claims to thecontrary, neither his own data nor theory supports the claimthat group-group competition was cutthroat through thePleistocene (Bowles 2009; Kelly 2005). Group-mindednesscomes before large groups.In short, there are some differences in emphasis betweenmy work and that of Tomasello and colleagues, but their corehypothesis is on the money.This content downloaded from 128.243.002.141 on January 25, 2016 04:25:49 AMAll use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).Tomasello et al. Interdependence Hypothesis 689ReplyWe are very grateful for the sympathetic and constructivecritiques of our paper. The divergences of opinion that havearisen are, by and large, a matter of emphasis and detail, ratherthan substantive disagreements. Nevertheless, we appreciatethe opportunity to clarify three key points with regard to (1)the status of the Stag Hunt metaphor, (2) the relation of ourhypothesis to the cooperative breeding hypothesis, and (3)the evolutionary timing of the transition to group-minded-ness.The Stag Hunt as a Model for CooperationThe Stag Hunt model is game-theoretic tool whose intendeduse is metaphorical, rather than literal. And while we do seecollaborative foraging as having played a centrally importantrole in the evolution of human-specific cooperative capacities,the applicability of the model is not restricted to foragingactivities.The Stag Hunt refers to any situation in which multipleindividuals gain payoff benefits from successfully collaborat-ing, these benefits are greater than acting alone, and individ-uals engaged in collaboration sacrifice in some way. Thus,Gilby’s and Hawkes’s point is well taken, that when chim-panzees launch a hunt for a monkey, alternative foragingpotential in the form of vegetation may not be lost. The “soloalternative,” which is lost in this case, may be more akin toan individual’s personal energetic reserves, safety, or time thatmight have been devoted to courtship, mating, or resting.Indeed, the only difference between the Stag Hunt and Gilbyand Connor’s (2010) “by-product mutualism” model of co-operation appears to be simply that an alternative potentialto cooperation is actually specified in the model. Likewise,whatever is represented by the stag in such a situation neednot be mobile prey, or prey at all. For instance, collectivedefense of some scavengeable remains or engagement in col-lective group defense may benefit an individual far beyondan attempt to defend the carcass or themselves in a solo effort.Given that the Stag Hunt is a metaphor for the payoffsentailed in a coordination problem, we agree with Sterelnythat, in addition to collaborative foraging, multiple forms ofcooperation played an important role in contributing some-thing toward a “human cooperative suite” (see Sterelny 2011),including scavenging, reproductive cooperation, and coop-erative breeding (see Chapais 2010; Hrdy 2009). We simplyargue that at an early stage, the benefits of cooperation andthe dynamics of interdependence would have largely back-grounded any potential free-rider problem.Hawkes’s plea for actual examples in addition to hypo-thetical scenarios is also well taken. We envisage that, in smallgroups, targeted hunting of prime adult bovids and cervids,which was well established in the late Pleistocene (but oc-curred also in the middle Pleistocene; Stiner 2002), as well asthe scavenging activities that appear to functionally precedethis, may well have been Stag Hunt–type situations. The sol-itary big-game hunting of many of today’s foragers (e.g.,Hawkes, O’Connell, and Blurton-Jones 2001) does not standin contradiction to this: the Broad Spectrum Revolution overthe past 40,000 years involved a drastic expansion of the hom-inin subsistence base and, critically, the emergence of projec-tile weaponry such as spears, and bows and arrows (Stiner2001). This would have dramatically reduced the risk asso-ciated with any stag-type pursuit. But Stag Hunt problemscontinue to present themselves, even in contemporary for-aging populations: Alvard and Nolin (2002) show, for in-stance, that whale-hunting practices in the Lamelera of In-donesia conform well to such a payoff structure: anindividual’s returns from a collaborative whale hunt are nu-tritionally superior to those attained by solitary fishing, butriskier. Nevertheless, group norms for sharing the spoils hereappear to enable coordination to great success.The Role of Cooperative BreedingHrdy’s cooperative breeding hypothesis (2009) elegantly doc-uments a mechanism by which extramaternal support in earlychild-rearing environments enabled reduced interbirth inter-vals in females and the bearing of offspring with extendeddevelopmental phases. We fully acknowledge the profoundsignificance of such novel breeding environments in perhapsproviding a context for the development of human-specificprosocial emotions and motivations. But we offer two caveats.The first is that it is difficult to see how cooperative breedingalone could explain the sophisticated cognitive componentsof human shared intentionality. Cooperative breeders such asthe callitrichids are, of course, unusual in their cooperativetendencies, but these manifest themselves in action primarilyin the form of infant carrying, shared vigilance, and foodprovisioning, where the requirement for simultaneous actualcoordination is low, and there is typically some delay betweeneach individual’s investment (for an overview, see Burkart,Hrdy, and van Schaik 2009). In searching for the evolutionaryhome of an ability to coordinate actions, form shared goalsand joint commitments, monitor and reverse designated roles,communicate relevant information and action plans, andshare resources dependently upon prior collaboration (seeTomasello et al. 2005), activities such as collaborative foragingappear to more obviously demand not just all of these, butall of them simultaneously. (Cultural institutions and lan-guage, from our second evolutionary step, make the pointeven more strongly.)In addition, the fact that high levels of cooperativeness andprosociality emerge early in human ontogeny does not meanthat they were directly selected for in infancy. Traits that areadaptive in adulthood often have ontogenetic pathways thatbegin in childhood, as long as these early forms are not mal-adaptive for children.This content downloaded from 128.243.002.141 on January 25, 2016 04:25:49 AMAll use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).690 Current Anthropology Volume 53, Number 6, December 2012The Evolutionary Emergence ofGroup-MindednessSterelny takes late Pleistocene archeological remains indicat-ing symbolic behavior and regional style as evidence for theemergence of group-mindedness. But he suggests that the keyfactors that we cite as driving this emergence (rising groupsizes and intergroup conflict) appear only much later, at thePleistocene-Holocene transition. He thus concluded that“group-mindedness comes before large groups.”There is little dispute that upper Paleolithic hominins weresymbolically modern (Bar-Yosef 2002). However, the claimthat symbolic competence emerged with a “creative explo-sion” in upper Paleolithic Eurasia (see, e.g., Chase and Dibble1987) is contested: symbolic behavior and marking may havemuch earlier roots in middle Stone Age Africa, as evidenced,for example, by burial remains and potentially symbolic useof red ochre pigment for symbolic marking (McBrearty andBrooks 2000).We in no way intend to resolve this debate. Rather, wehighlight that utilitarian arguments against, for example, thesymbolic use of ochre for group marking (e.g., that it mayhave been used to enhance visibility or to increase perceivedthreat; Sterelny 2011) may just point to an early stage in theemergence of the medium as symbolic: status functionsemerge as humans collectively come to regard some naturalor brute phenomenon (typically, actions or objects) as havinga special meaning (Searle 1995). So media that were used forsymbolic group marking are expected to enter the archeo-logical record for utilitarian functions initially. And there issome evidence that group size increases long before the Pa-leolithic may have created selection pressures related to main-taining group cohesion: since community size and complexitycorrelate with neocortex ratio in anthropoid primates (Dun-bar 1993, 2009), group sizes can be estimated for early hom-inins (Aiello and Dunbar 1993). Rather than indicating anysignificant change in size around the Holocene, these esti-mates suggest that group numbers progressed toward criticallevels over the middle Pleistocene, with the emergence ofHomo heidelbergensis between 400,000 and 150,000 years ago.At this time, it is suggested, new mechanisms for maintainingwithin-group social cohesion would have become of para-mount importance.Finally, increases in group size and intergroup conflict maynot have temporally co-occurred in driving the emergence ofgroup-mindedness. It is conceivable that with increasinggroup sizes, initially functional behaviors (such as foragingtechniques or utilitarian uses of red ochre) began to functionas useful conventional indicators of group membership, aid-ing in-group members in their choices of whom to coordinatewith and whom to trust. At a later point, increasingly routineintergroup conflicts might have partially transformed the rel-evance of these internal group signals to the status of between-group cultural markers.—Emily Wyman, Michael Tomasello, Alicia Melis,Claudio Tennie, and Esther HerrmannReferences CitedAiello, L., and R.

Enhanced Mutualism Hypothesis,346569568,Resource-based models of mutualism,,"Cropp, R, Norbury, J",2018,"Mutualist interactions are thought to be ubiquitous, spanning all levels of biological organisation, and involving most species on Earth. However, in contrast to population interactions such as competition and predation, a comprehensive and succinct theoretical explanation of mutualism has proved elusive. We use a new modelling framework that represents obligation, mutualist benefits and mutualist costs in an extended consumer resource approach to develop simple, consistent models of mutualism. We show how populations may stably transition between facultative and obligate mutualism and demonstrate that our solutions do not depend on saturating functions. We show facultative and obligate mutualisms between autotrophs and heterotrophs",,Journal article,,,'Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden GmbH'

Enhanced Mutualism Hypothesis,484265775,Evidence of Human Adaptations for Cooperative Partner Choice in a Biological Market,,"Eisenbruch, Adar Benjamin",2017,"Despite the importance of human cooperation, how humans choose their cooperative partners and how they divide the spoils of cooperation are not yet fully understood. Mutual partner choice creates competitive conditions for cooperative relationship formation, in which individuals compete to form cooperative relationships with the most valuable available partners. Biological market theory therefore predicts that the spoils of cooperation will be divided as a function of each party’s cooperative partner value. This dissertation reports research designed to test two interrelated hypotheses: (1) humans will possess psychological mechanisms designed by natural selection to assess the value of an individual as a long-term cooperative partner, and (2) human intuitions about how the spoils of cooperation should be divided will track cues of cooperative partner value. Six studies were conducted to test these hypotheses. Two commonly-used economic games (the ultimatum game and the trust game) were used to test cooperative partner preferences and resource division intuitions (studies 1-5), and a friend choice task was used to test cooperative partner preferences (study 6). Cooperative partner traits were represented by facial photographs (studies 1, 2 and 6), or were experimentally manipulated with verbal information and in-game monetary consequences (studies 3-5). Results supported the hypotheses. Participants exhibited preferences for partners who appeared more valuable as long-term cooperative partners, and these preferences appeared to be specialized for ancestral forms of cooperation: participants were more sensitive to cues of ancestral productivity than contemporary productivity, participants were more sensitive to cues of productivity when they revealed stable skills rather than luck, and men relied relatively more on a partner’s productivity (versus their generosity) than did women. In addition, intuitions about resource divisions were sensitive to cues of partner value: partners who appeared more valuable received more favorable divisions in the ultimatum game, and more productive partners were judged as more fair in the trust game, regardless of their actual generosity. The discussion of results focuses on future directions for the application of biological market theory and the logic of cooperative partner choice to problems in social psychology",,etd,"Psychology, Behavioral sciences, bargaining, biological market, cooperation, evolutionary psychology, fairness, partner choice",,"eScholarship, University of California"

We tested the hypotheses that selection for costly excretions in a focal population (i) decreases when an exploiter is added (ii) increases when a third mutualist is added relative to the pair-wise scenario. We assayed the selection acting on Salmonella enterica when it exchanges methionine for carbon in an obligate mutualism with an auxotrophic Escherichia coli. A third bacterium, Methylobacterium extorquens, was then added and acted either as an exploiter of the carbon or third obligate mutualist depending on the nitrogen source. In the tripartite mutualism M. extorquens provided nitrogen to the other species. Contrary to our expectations, adding an exploiter increased selection for methionine excretion in S. enterica.

For example, a butterfly receives nectar, a rich source of food, from the flower of a plant and in turn moves pollen from that plant to another far away (Figure 1). In order to reflect about the widespread nature of mutualism, John N. Thompson proposed the following thought experiment: try to imagine a plant species that is viable in its natural habitat without using on top of its own nuclear genome the genomes of a mitochondrion, a chloroplast, of several mycorrhizal fungi, of several insects to pollinate it and of several species of bird to disperse its seeds. Mutualism is everywhere and it is assumed that mutualistic interactions have played a major role in the diversification of life on Earth. An often-cited example is the rich adaptive radiation of the flowering plants (angiosperms), with about 300,000 described species. Flowering plants originated around 160 million years ago and diversified fast during the Early Cretaceous, so that by around 120 million years ago they had become widespread. It is generally assumed that such a fast diversification is largely the result of the mutualistic interaction with pollinators. Thus, mutualism has been most likely shaping the diversity of species on Earth from an early stage. But the relationships between mutualism and diversity are not yet clear, mainly because mutualism has traditionally been studied within pairs or small groups of species. Also, mutualism has historically been studied in isolation from competition, so it is unclear how these two forces balance each other in ecological communities",,"Journal Article, PeerReviewed, info:eu-repo/semantics/article, info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion","Institute of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies, 570 Life sciences; biology, 590 Animals (Zoology)",,'Elsevier BV'

This study concentrates on the emergence of cooperation among heterogeneous populations. A simple model is proposed by considering the impact of interplay between the evolution of strategies and that of social partnerships on cooperation dynamics. Whenever two individuals acquire the rewards by playing prisoner&apos;s dilemma game with each other, the friendship (friendship is quantified as the weight of a link) between the two individuals deepens. Individuals can switch off the social ties with the partners who are unfriendly and rewire to similar new ones. Under this partner switching mechanism, population structure is divided into several groups and cooperation can prevail. It is observed that the frequent tendency of partner switching can lead to the enhancement of cooperative behavior under the enormous temptation to defect. Moreover, the influence of discounting the relationship between different individuals is also investigated. Meanwhile, the cooperation prevails when the adjustment of friendships mainly depends on the incomes of selected individuals rather than that of their partners. Finally, it is found that too similar population fail to maximize the cooperation and there exists a moderate similarity that can optimize cooperation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This approach reveals that some forms of symmetrical cooperation do not require mechanisms """"specifically designed for"""" benefiting others, whereas effective helping requires a specific mechanism that relatively unconditionally and persistently responds to the vulnerability of other individuals. Unraveling the causal structure of different types of other-benefiting shows that a mechanism for asymmetrical helping may considerably improve symmetrical cooperation through properties such as tolerance, patience, and the human capacity to experience a wide variety of moral emotions.

Beraldo, R. Sugden1 IntroductionStudies of animal behaviour have found many practices which create collective ben-efits at some apparent cost or risk to individual participants. Examples include alarmcalls, food-sharing, grooming, and participation in inter-group warfare. One of themost fundamental problems in evolutionary biology since Darwin (1859) has been toexplain how such forms of cooperation evolve by natural selection.An analogous prob-lem in economics has been to look for explanations of cooperative human practices,such as the fulfilment of market obligations, the provision of public goods throughvoluntary contributions, and the management of common property resources, that areconsistent with the traditional assumption of individual self-interest.1 Many differ-ent theories have been proposed by biologists and economists as possible solutions.Among the mechanisms that have been modelled are direct and indirect reciprocity,kin selection, group selection, and the ‘green beard’ mechanism. (For an overview ofthese mechanisms, see Nowak (2006). Tomasello (2014) provides a comprehensiveaccount of why and how cooperation may have evolved among early humans. Hishypothesis is that early humans were forced by ecological circumstances into morecooperative modes of life, and this led to the evolution of ways of thinking that weredirected towards coordination with others to achieve joint goals.) Some economistshave combined biological and economic modes of explanation, hypothesising thathuman cooperation in the modern world is a product of genetically hard-wired traitsthat evolved by natural selection to equip Homo sapiens for life in hunter-gatherersocieties. In some versions of this hypothesis, those traits act as equilibrium selectiondevices in the modern ‘game of life’ (e.g. Binmore 1994, 1998); in others, they cangenerate non-selfish behaviour in modern societies (e.g. Boyd et al. 2005; Bowles andGintis 2011).However, a recent trend in biology has been to question whether such sophisticatedexplanations are always necessary. Many forms of apparently cooperative behaviourhave been found to be forms of mutualism: the ‘cooperating’ individual derives suf-ficient direct fitness benefit to make the behaviour worthwhile, and any effect on thefitness of others is incidental (e.g. Clutton-Brock 2002, 2009; Sachs et al. 2004). TheSnowdrift game (Sugden 1986), in which equilibrium involves cooperation by oneplayer and free-riding by the other, is increasingly used in biology as a model of suchbehaviour. In this paper, we present a newmodel of the evolution of cooperation whichfits with this trend of thought.Ourmethodological approach treats the biological and economic problems of coop-eration as isomorphic to one another. That is, we hypothesise that the emergence andreproduction of human cooperative practices are governed by evolutionary mecha-nisms that are distinct from, but structurally similar to, those of natural selection.Candidate mechanisms include trial-and-error learning by individuals, imitation of1 In parallel with attempts to explain human cooperation in terms of self-interest, there is a large literaturein economics in which cooperation is explained as a product of non-selfish motivations, such as altruism,preferences for equality, fairness or welfare-maximisation, team reasoning, or intrinsic desires to cooperate.Without denying the existence of such motivations, we think it is useful to investigate the explanatory powerof the self-interest assumption.123The emergence of reciprocally beneficial cooperationsuccessful neighbours, and cultural selection through inter-group competition. Analy-ses which use this approach may be both informed by and informative to theoreticalbiology. For example, Sugden’s (1986) analysis of the emergence of social norms wasinspired by the earlier work of theoretical biologists, but it developed new models (inparticular, the Snowdrift andMutual Aid games) which have since been widely used inbiology (e.g. Leimar and Hammerstein 2001; Nowak and Sigmund 2005). The modelthat we present in this paper can be interpreted as a representation either of naturalselection or of trial-and-error human learning.Our modelling strategy is distinctive in that it uses three assumptions which incombination rule out most of the mechanisms that feature in existing theories of coop-eration. Specifically, we assume that interactions are anonymous, that evolution takesplace in a large, well-mixed population, and that the evolutionary process selectsstrategies according to their material payoffs. The assumption of anonymity excludesmechanisms based on reputation, reciprocity or third-party punishment. The assump-tion ofwellmixedness excludesmechanisms of group or kin selection. The assumptionthat selection is for material payoffs excludes mechanisms which postulate non-selfishpreferences as an explanatory primitive. Working within the constraints imposed bythese assumptions, we are able to generate a simple and robust model of cooperation.Our model adapts the familiar framework of a Prisoner’s Dilemma that is playedrecurrently in a large population. We introduce two additional features, which wesuggest can be found in many real-world cases of potentially cooperative interaction,both for humans and for other animals.The first additional feature is that participation in the game is voluntary. One of therestrictive properties of the Prisoner’s Dilemma is that, in any given interaction, anindividual must act either pro-socially (the strategy of cooperation) or anti-socially(the strategy of defection or cheating, which allows a cheater to benefit at the expenseof a cooperator). There is no opportunity to be simply asocial. We add an asocialstrategy, that of opting out of the interaction altogether. Of course, if the only differencebetween anti-social and asocial behaviour was that asocial individuals did not benefitwhen their co-players chose to cooperate, asociality would be a dominated strategy. Itis an essential part of our model that if both players cheat, both are worse off than ifthey had opted out of the interaction.2The second additional feature is that the payoff that each player receives if theyboth cooperate is subject to random variation. Before choosing his (or her, or its)strategy, each player knows his own cooperative payoff, but not the other player’s.With non-zero probability, the payoff from mutual cooperation is greater than thatfrom cheating against a cooperator. Thus, there are circumstances in which it wouldbe profitable for a player to cooperate if he were sufficiently confident that the otherplayer would cooperate too. Crucially, however, it is never common knowledge that thepayoffs are such that mutual cooperation is a Nash equilibrium. In our model, playersreceive no information at all about the realisation of the random component of their2 In some simplified models of the Prisoner’s Dilemma, each player makes an independent decision aboutwhether to incur a fixed cost to confer a larger fixed benefit on the other player; payoffs in the four possibleoutcomes are defined as sums of these costs and benefits. Because we want to distinguish between cheatingand non-participation, our model does not have this additivity property.123S. Beraldo, R. Sugdenco-players’ cooperative payoff. This is obviously an extreme assumption; we use itonly as a modelling simplification. In real interactions, players often have some suchinformation. [For example, explanations of animal behaviour in asymmetric contestsoften depend on the assumption that both contestants recognise some feature of thegame which signals which of them is more likely to attach the higher value to thedisputed resource (Maynard Smith and Parker 1976).] But the main qualitative resultsof our model require only that each player has some private information about his ownpayoffs such that, with non-zero probability, a player may know that cooperation isa non-dominated strategy for him without knowing whether the same is true for theother player.3As an illustration of the kind of interaction that our model represents, we offerthe following variant of Rousseau’s (1755/1998, p. 36) story of hunting in a state ofnature. Two individuals jointly have the opportunity to invest time and energy to hunta deer. The hunters can succeed only by acting on a concerted plan out of sight of oneanother. A hunt begins only if both individuals agree to take part. Each can then cheatby unilaterally pursuing a smaller prey, which the other’s deer hunting tends to flushout and make easier to catch. The anticipated benefit of deer hunting to an individual,conditional on the other’s not cheating, can be different for different individuals andon different occasions. Sometimes, but not always, this benefit is sufficiently low thatunilateral cheating pays off.As a more modern illustration, consider two individuals who make contact throughthe internet. One of them is offering to sell some good which has to be customised tomeet the specific requirements of the buyer; the other is looking to buy such a good.If they agree to trade, each individual invests resources in the transaction (exchanginginformation, producing and dispatching the good, sending payment). Each may haveopportunities to gain by deviating from the terms of the agreement. Sometimes, butnot always, the benefit of completing the transaction is sufficiently low that unilateralcheating pays off.We will show how the interaction of voluntary participation and stochastic payoffscan induce cooperation. Of course, it is well known that voluntary participation canfacilitate cooperation when players can distinguish between more and less cooper-ative opponents. If such distinctions are possible, voluntary participation can allowcooperators to avoid interacting with cheats. This can sustain cooperation without theneed for informationally and cognitively more demanding strategies of reciprocity orpunishment—an idea that can be traced back to Smith’s (1763/1978, pp. 538–539)analysis of trustworthiness among traders in commercial societies. But such mecha-nisms are ruled out by our anonymity assumption.In our model, voluntary participation facilitates cooperation by a different route.Because would-be cheats have the alternative option of non-participation, and becausenon-participation is the best response to cheating, the equilibrium frequency ofcheating is subject to an upper limit. If cheating occurs at all, the expected pay-off from cheating cannot be less than that from non-participation. Thus, for any3 The gamewould be very different (and rather trivial) if all payoffs were common knowledge. In that case,there would be a Nash equilibrium in which there was no cheating and in which each player cooperated ifand only if both players gained more from mutual cooperation than from cheating against a cooperator.123The emergence of reciprocally beneficial cooperationgiven frequency of cooperation, the frequency of cheating is self-limiting. Theunderlying mechanism is similar to that of the Lotka–Volterra model of interactionbetween predators and prey: the size of the predator population (the frequency ofcheating) is limited by the size of the prey population (the frequency of coopera-tion).Clearly, however, this mechanism can support cooperation only if, when the fre-quency of cheating is sufficiently low, some players choose to cooperate. This couldnot be the case if, as in the Prisoner’s Dilemma, cooperation was always a weaklydominated strategy. In our model, random variation in the payoff from mutual coop-eration ensures that players sometimes find it worthwhile to cooperate, despite therisk of meeting a cheat. The players who cooperate are those for whom the benefitof mutual cooperation is sufficient to compensate for this risk. Because cooperatorsare self-selecting in this way, the average payoff in the game is greater than the pay-off to non-participation. In other words, despite the presence of cheats, beneficialcooperation occurs.As a first step in developing an evolutionary model, we begin (in Sect. 2) bypresenting our variant of the Prisoner’s Dilemma as a one-shot game and identi-fying its symmetric Bayesian Nash equilibria. We show that, provided the upperbound of the distribution of cooperative benefit is not too low, the game has atleast one such equilibrium in which beneficial cooperation occurs. In Sect. 3, weinvestigate some comparative-static properties of equilibria in this game. We showthat as the distribution of cooperative benefit becomes more favourable, the max-imum frequency of cooperation that is sustainable in equilibrium increases. InSect. 4, we examine the dynamics of the model, using simple analytical meth-ods. In Sect. 5, we supplement this analysis by computer simulations based onreplicator dynamics. Our analysis shows that, in the neighbourhood of ‘interior’equilibria in which some but not all players choose non-participation, the dynam-ics are similar to those of predator–prey models. Depending on the payoffs of thegame, interior equilibria may be locally stable (with evolutionary paths spirallingin from a large zone of attraction) or unstable (with evolutionary paths spirallingout and ending at an equilibrium of non-participation). In Sect. 6, we discuss thecontribution that our model can make to the explanation of cooperative behav-iour. We show that, despite sharing some features of existing biological models ofmutualism and voluntary participation, our model isolates a distinct causal mecha-nism.2 The model: equilibrium propertiesIn this section and in Sect. 3, we present our game in one-shot form and analyseits equilibrium properties. This is a game for two players 1 and 2. For each playeri ∈ {1, 2} , the benefit xi that he gains if both players cooperate is an independentrealisation of a random variable X whose distribution f (.) is continuous with support[xmin, xmax]. Each player knows his own benefit but not that of the other player. Giventhis knowledge, he plays a game with three pure strategies: to cooperate (C), to cheat(D), or not to participate (N). The payoff matrix is shown in Table 1.123S. Beraldo, R. SugdenTable 1 Payoff matrix for thegamePlayer 1 Player 2N C DN 0, 0 0, 0 0, 0C 0, 0 x1, x2 –b, aD 0, 0 a, –b –c, –cxmax > a > xmin ≥ 0; b > c > 0.The essential features of the game are contained in the structure of best responses.4The condition xmax > a > xmin implies that either C or D (but not N) may be thebetter response toC, depending on the relevant player’s realisation of X . The conditionb > c implies that, as in the Prisoner’s Dilemma, D is better than C as a response toD. Given that the payoff to N is normalised to zero, a > 0 implies that cheating givesa higher payoff than non-participation if the opponent cooperates; c > 0 implies thatthe opposite is the case if the opponent cheats. No assumption is made about whethera − b (i.e. the net benefit of an interaction in which one player cooperates and theother cheats) is positive, zero or negative. It is easy to imagine real-world applications(such as our example of internet trading) in which any of these possibilities would beplausible.5 The condition xmin ≥ 0 (which is not essential for our main results) impliesthat players are never worse off from mutual cooperation than from non-participation.We now consider symmetric Bayesian Nash equilibria (SBNE) of the game.Although our formal analysis in this section and in Sect. 3 treats the game as one-shot,our ultimate concern is with SBNEs as possible stationary points in an evolutionaryprocess in a well-mixed population.We will say that a pure strategy (N, C or D) is played in a given equilibrium ifand only if the unconditional probability with which it is played is non-zero. Somesignificant properties of SBNE hold for all parameter values. First, there is a non-participation equilibrium in which only N is played; in this equilibrium, players’payoffs are zero and unilateral deviations lead to neither gain nor loss. Second, thereis no SBNE in which C is played butD is not. (Against an opponent who might play Cbut will not playD, i’s best response playsDwhen xi < a.) Third, there is no SBNE inwhichD is played but not C. (Against an opponent who might playD but will not playC, N is the unique best response.) Thus, only two types of equilibrium participationare possible. Depending on the parameter values, there may be an interior equilibriumin whichN,D andC are all played; and there may be a boundary equilibrium in whichD and C are played but not N.4 Provided that this best response structure is maintained, themain implications of themodel are preserved.It is not essential that the payoff from playing C against C is stochastic and that all other payoffs are not;but there must be some random variation in the payoffs, such that the best reply to C is sometimes C andsometimes D.5 In our game, unlike the ‘additive’ Prisoner’s Dilemma games described in Footnote 2, the sign of a − bimposes no constraints on whether the payoff from playing C against C is greater or less than that fromplaying D against D.123The emergence of reciprocally beneficial cooperationSince the only information on which a player can condition his strategy choice isprivate to that player, and given the assumed properties of f (.), any SBNE can bedescribed by the values of two variables. The variable β ∈ [xmin, xmax] is definedsuch that each player i chooses C if and only if xi ≥ β. The variable π ∈ [0, 1]is the probability that each player i chooses D, conditional on xmin < xi < β. Inthe non-participation equilibrium, β = xmax and π = 0. In an interior equilibrium,xmin < β < xmax and 0 < π < 1. In a boundary equilibrium, xmin < β < xmax andπ = 1.We now analyse these equilibria. Consider any player i facing an opponent whosestrategy is described by (β, π), in an interaction in which xi = β. Let VN , VD, VCand VM be the expected payoffs to player i from playing N, D, C andM, respectively,where M is the mix of D with probability π and N with probability (1 − π). Letg(x) ≡ F(x)/[1 − F(x)], where F(.) is the cumulative of f (.). It is straightforwardto derive the following expressions:VN = 0 (1)VD = [1 − F(β)]a − F(β)πc (2)VC = [1 − F(β)]β − F(β)πb (3)VM = πVD. (4)In analysing equilibrium, it is convenient to work in a (β, π) space defined byxmin ≤ β ≤ xmax and π ≥ 0. Notice that this space includes points at which π > 1.Although such points have no interpretation within our model, Eqs. (1)–(4) abovedefine VN , VD, VC , and VM for all values of π . This allows us to define the lociof points in this (β, π) space at which the mathematical equations VN = VD andVC = VM are satisfied, and then to characterise equilibria in terms of these loci,imposing the inequality π ≤ 1 as an additional constraint. This method of analysis isuseful in simplifying the proofs of our results.First, consider the locus of points in the (β, π) space at which VN = VD . Anyinterior equilibrium must be a point on this ND locus, with 0 < π < 1; any boundaryequilibrium must be a point at which VN ≤ VD and π = 1. By (1) and (2), this locusis determined by:VD ≥ (or <)VN ⇔ a/πc ≥ (or <)g(β). (5)This is a continuous and downward-sloping curve which includes the point (xmax, 0)and is asymptotic to β = xmin. It divides the (β, π) space into three regions: the setof points on the locus, at which VN = VD; the set of points inside the locus (that is,below and to the left), at which VN < VD; and the set of points outside the locus (thatis, above and to the right), at which VN > VD .Now consider the locus of points at which VC = VM . Every equilibrium mustbe a point on this CM locus, with either π = 0 (the non-participation equilibrium),0 < π < 1 (an interior equilibrium), or π = 1 (a boundary equilibrium). Combiningequations (2)–(4), this locus is determined by:VC ≥ (or <)VM ⇔ (β − πa)/[π(b − πc)] ≥ (or <)g(β). (6)123S. Beraldo, R. SugdenThis is a continuous curve which includes the points (xmin, xmin/a) and (xmax, 0) andhas the property that π < 1 when β ≤ a. It divides the (β, π) space into three regions:the set of points on the locus, at which VC = VM ; the set of points inside the locus, atwhich VC > VM ; and the set of points outside the locus, at which VM > VC .Propositions (5) and (6) together imply the following result about the relative posi-tions of the two loci:if VD = VN and β < xmax and π > 0 then VC ≥ (or <)VM ⇔ β ≥ (or <)ab/c.(7)The loci intersect at the non-participation equilibrium (xmax, 0). If xmax ≤ ab/c, thereis no other intersection and hence no interior equilibrium.6 This case is illustrated inFig. 1a. (The loci are shown by the curves ND and CM; N is the non-participationequilibrium. Sections of these loci which pass above π = 1 are drawn in grey dots tosignify that these points have no interpretation within the model. The arrows refer tothe dynamic analysis, whichwill be presented in Sect. 4.) If instead xmax > ab/c, thereis exactly one other intersection, at β = ab/c. There are now three alternative cases.In the first case, illustrated in Fig. 1b, this intersection is at π < 1. This intersection,denoted I, is an interior equilibrium, defined by β = ab/c, π = a/g(ab/c).7 Thesevalues of β and π imply that the probability with which C is played, conditional onparticipation in the game (i.e. conditional onN not being played) is c/(a+c), ensuringthat VD = 0. (Equivalently, the frequencies with which C and D are played are inthe ratio c:a.) There may also be boundary equilibria; these occur if the CM locusintersects the line π = 1 to the left of the ND locus.In the second case, the loci intersect at π > 1. Because the CM locus is continuous,and because xmin/a < 1, there must be at least one value of β in the interval a < β <ab/c at which the CM locus intersects the line π = 1. Any such point is a boundaryequilibrium. This case is illustrated in Fig. 1c; B is a boundary equilibrium. In thethird case (not illustrated), the loci intersect exactly at π = 1. Then this intersectionis a boundary equilibrium. In this case, there may be other boundary equilibria.The foregoing argument establishes:Result 1 If xmax > ab/c, there is at least one (interior or boundary) equilibrium with0 < π ≤ 1 and xmin < β < xmax.In other words, provided the upper tail of the distribution of cooperative benefit is nottoo short, there is at least one equilibrium in which both C and D are played.We now consider players’ payoffs in such equilibria. Let V *(β, π ) be the ex anteexpected payoff to any player i , prior to the realisations of the random variable X ,given that i and his opponent play according to β and π . We will call V ∗(β, π) thevalue of the game conditional on (β, π).The following results are derived in the Mathematical Appendix:6 In this case, it is possible that the CM locus intersects the line π = 1, creating boundary equilibria.However, this would require a high proportion of the probability mass of f (X) to be between a and xmax,despite the fact that xmax ≤ ab/c.7 The equilibrium value of π can be derived from (2) using the fact that, in an interior equilibrium, VD = 0.123The emergence of reciprocally beneficial cooperationFig. 1 Equilibria and dynamics.a Non-participation the onlyequilibrium. b An interiorequilibrium. c A boundaryequilibriumabc123S. Beraldo, R. SugdenResult 2 In every interior and boundary equilibrium, the value of the game is strictlypositive.Result 3 Suppose there are two equilibria, (β, π), (β ′, π ′), such that β < β ′. ThenV ∗(β, π) > V ∗(β ′, π ′).Result 2 establishes that in every interior and boundary equilibrium, cooperativeactivity creates positive net benefits relative to the benchmark of non-participation,despite the non-zero probability of cheating. If there are multiple equilibria, one ofthese is distinguished by its having the lowest value of β. (Since there can be no morethan one interior equilibrium, no two equilibria have the same value of β.) Result 3establishes that this is the equilibrium at which the value of the game is greatest. Wewill call this the highest-value equilibrium.3 The model: comparative staticsThe frequency of cooperative behaviour that can be sustained in equilibrium dependson the distribution of cooperative benefit X . To keep the exposition simple, we analysethe effect of a rightward shift from one distribution F to an unambiguously superiordistribution G when there is no change in the support [xmin, xmax]. That is, for allxmin < z < xmax,G(z) < F(z). The values of all other parameters are held constant.Using (5) it can be shown that if some point (β, π) is on the ND locus for thedistribution F , it is inside the corresponding locus for G. Similarly, using (6), if somepoint (β, π) is on the CM locus for the distribution F , it is inside the correspondinglocus for G. Thus, an improvement in the distribution of cooperative benefit movesboth loci outwards. Figure 2 illustrates the effects of a shift in the distribution from F[inducing the loci ND(F) and CM(F)] to G [inducing the loci ND(G) and CM(G)].As this diagram shows, if the game has interior equilibria for both distributions,those equilibria have the same value of β, namely ab/c, but the G equilibrium has ahigher value of π . Since G(ab/c) < F(ab/c) and the frequencies with which C andD are played are in the fixed ratio c:a, both C and D are played with higher frequencyFig. 2 Effects of a shift in thedistribution of cooperativebenefit123The emergence of reciprocally beneficial cooperationin the G equilibrium than in the F equilibrium. More intuitively, the relationshipbetween cooperation and cheating is analogous to that between prey and predator. Ifthe distribution of cooperative benefit becomes more favourable, a higher frequencyof cooperation is induced; but the more cooperation there is, the more cheating can besustained.If the game has boundary equilibria for both distributions, the highest-value Gequilibrium must be to the left of the highest-value F equilibrium. (This can be seenby considering the effect of an outward shift of the CM locus in Fig. 1c.) Thus, theformer equilibrium induces a higher frequency of cooperation than the latter.The following general result is proved in the Appendix:Result 4 Suppose xmax > ab/c and let F , G be two distributions of X such that Gis rightward of F . Then in the highest-value G equilibrium, the frequency of cooper-ation and the value of the game are both strictly greater than in the highest-value Fequilibrium.Thus, as the distribution of cooperative benefit becomes progressively morefavourable, the maximum sustainable frequency of cooperation increases.8 Increasesin cooperation are associated with increases in cheating until the frequency of non-participation falls to zero.4 The model: dynamicsWenow embed our game in an evolutionary process.We consider a finite population ofpotential players, sufficiently large to legitimate the use of the law of large numbers.In each of a long series of periods, individuals from this population are randomlyand anonymously matched to play the game. Since we are presenting an evolutionaryanalysis, we do not define any concept of ‘lifetime’ utility that players maximise.Instead, we assume that, at the population level, behaviour gravitates towards whateverpattern of play is currently payoff-maximising for individuals, given the behaviour ofthe population as a whole.In this section, we present a simple dynamic analysis that can be represented inthe (β, π) space of Fig. 1. For the purposes of this analysis, β and π are interpretedas descriptions of the mix of strategies played in the population at any given time:β ∈ [xmin, xmax] is the critical value of X such that C is chosen by any player i if andonly if xi ≥ β, and π ∈ [0, 1] is the relative frequency of D choices among playersfor whom xi < β. We assume that β and π evolve independently. (In a biologicalapplication, this is equivalent to assuming that β and π are determined by distinctsets of genes.) Thus, the direction of change of β depends on the relative values ofVC and VM : β tends to increase (respectively: decrease) if VM > VC (VM < VC ).The direction of change of π depends on the relative values of VD and VN : π tendsto increase (decrease) if VD > VN (VD < VN ). This gives the dynamics shown inphase-diagram form in Fig. 1.8 This comparative-static property is compatible with evidence that in both human and non-human interac-tion, the level of cooperation is greater, the higher the payoffs to cooperation (Clutton-Brock 2002; Capraroet al. 2014).123S. Beraldo, R. SugdenIn the case shown in Fig. 1a, the dynamics in the neighbourhood of the non-participation equilibrium (N) are cyclical. At the level of generality at which we areworking, it is not possible to determine whether this equilibrium is locally stable, butit has a non-empty zone of attraction, including at least all points at which β = xmax.In the cases shown in Fig. 1b, c, the non-participation equilibrium is locally unstable.(In these cases, all paths from points close to N but below the ND locus lead awayfromN, and must eventually pass through or to the left of the interior equilibrium I. Asin the case shown in Fig. 1a, N has a non-empty zone of attraction.) However, in statesin which almost all players choose non-participation, selection pressure is weak, andso the dynamics shown in the diagrams might work very slowly in the region close toN.It is clear from Fig. 1b that, in the neighbourhood of an interior equilibrium, thedynamics exhibit cyclical or spiralling paths. Described in terms of the evolution ofthe frequencies of the three strategies N, C and D, these paths are similar to those ofthe Rock–Paper–Scissors game. (The frequency of cooperation is greatest towards theleft of the diagram, where the value of β is low. From there, evolutionary paths leadtowards the top right, where the values of β and π are both high, and the frequency ofcheating is greatest. From there, paths lead towards the bottom right, where β is highand π is low, and the frequency of non-participation is greatest. And from there, pathslead back towards the left. If paths spiral outwards, they may lead into the zone ofattraction of the non-participation equilibrium.) These paths resemble predator–preyinteractions, cheats acting as predators and cooperators as prey.If the CM locus cuts the line π = 1 at a point where β < ab/c, this point is aboundary equilibrium. If, as in the case shown in Fig. 1c, points to the left of thisequilibrium are outside the locus, the equilibrium is locally stable. Not all boundaryequilibria have this property, but whenever the ND and CM loci intersect at π > 1,there must be at least one locally stable boundary equilibrium.5 SimulationsIn this section, we briefly illustrate some basic features of our theoretical model bymeans of computer simulations. Using a simple deterministic replicator dynamics, weanalyse the evolution of β and π over time, and the associated relative frequenciespN , pC and pD with which strategies N, C and D respectively are played. Furtherdetails are provided in the “Mathematical Appendix”.9In applying replicator dynamics to our game, we cannot treat N-players, C-playersand D-players as distinct sub-populations which replicate separately. This is because,in ourmodel, players’ decisions about whether or not to cooperate in any given interac-tion are conditioned on the relevant realisation of the random variable X . Our methodis to assume that at any given time t , all players are characterised by the same (β, π)pair. In replicator dynamics, the growth rate of the population fraction using a given9 In a preliminary version of this paper, we presented simulations based on a stochastic evolutionaryprocess in which selection acted directly on β and π . However, as a referee suggested, themain evolutionaryproperties of our model can be conveyed more simply through replicator dynamics.123The emergence of reciprocally beneficial cooperationTable 2 Type and stabilityproperties of interior equilibriaValue of c Interior equilibrium propertiesc ≤ 1.33 No interior equilibrium1.33 < c < 1.66 Improper node, unstablec = 1.66 Proper node, unstable1.66 < c < 2.3094 Spiral node, unstablec = 2.3094 Hopf bifurcation occurs2.3094 < c < 2.4 Spiral node, asymptotically stablec ≥ 2.4 No interior equilibriumstrategy is proportional to the difference between the current payoff of that strategyand the weighted average of the current payoffs of all strategies, each strategy beingweighted by the relative frequency with which it is played (Taylor and Jonker 1978).For the purposes of our analysis, we define the current payoff to each strategy as theexpected payoff to any player i from choosing that strategy, conditional on the currentvalues of pN , pC and pD and conditional on xi being equal to the current value of β.At each time t , the rates of change of pN , pC and pD are determined by the replicatorequations; these changes are then implemented through changes in β and π . Thismethod allows mathematically tractable simulations while conserving the essentialfeatures of the dynamics described theoretically in Sect. 4.10Our simulations use the parameter values a = 3, b = 4, xmin = 0 and xmax = 9;the distribution of X over the interval [xmin, xmax] is assumed to be uniform. Weinvestigate the dynamics at different values of c, with particular emphasis on values inthe interval [1.33, 2.4] in which interior equilibria occur. (If c ≤ 1.33, xmax ≤ ab/c,and so the CM and ND loci intersect only at the non-participation equilibrium; if c ≥2.4, the loci intersect at π ≥ 1.) Intuitively, increases in c (that is, increases in the costincurred by each player when both cheat) reduce the rewards from cheating and sofavour cooperation.Irrespective of the value of c, the non-participation equilibrium is unstable underreplicator dynamics. (Since C is the best response to every non-degenerate mix ofC and N, any path starting at a point at which π = 0 and xmax > β > xmin mustmove away from the non-participation equilibrium along the line π = 0.) However,there are also paths that converge to the non-participation equilibrium. (Since N is thebest response to every non-degenerate mix of N and D, any path starting at a point atwhich β = xmin and 1 > π > 0 must have this property.) The stability properties ofinterior equilibria are less immediately obvious. It turns out that, as c varies, there arequalitative changes in the dynamics associated with interior equilibria.Table 2 reports the type and stability properties of the interior equilibriumat differentvalues of c. This equilibrium is unstable for 1.33 < c < 2.3094 but asymptoticallystable for 2.3094 < c < 2.4. At c = 2.3094 there is a Hopf bifurcation (see the“Mathematical Appendix” for details).10 The main difference between the two ways of modelling the dynamics relates to states in which at leastone of pN , pC and pD is equal to zero (i.e. where β = xmin, β = xmax, π = 0 or π = 1). In replicatordynamics, a strategy that is not played in any one period is never played, irrespective of its payoffs. Sinceour main concern in this section is with interior equilibria, this difference is not particularly significant.123S. Beraldo, R. SugdenFigure 3 shows the dynamics at different values of c. In Fig. 3a, c = 1 and theCM and ND loci intersect only at the non-participation equilibrium. Paths that startclose to the non-participation equilibrium but below the CM locus initially moveaway from that equilibrium, but then approach it from above ND locus; all pathsconverge asymptotically to the β = xmax line. As c increases (Fig. 3b, c) the generalpicture does not change until the Hopf bifurcation occurs: paths that start close to theinterior equilibrium eventually approach the non-participation equilibrium. But afterthis bifurcation, paths that start below the ND locus spiral in to the interior equilibrium(Fig. 3d). The implication is that there is a range of parameter values for which a stableinterior equilibrium exists and has a large zone of attraction.6 DiscussionWe do not intend to claim that our model represents the mechanism that underlieshuman and animal cooperation. There is no good reason to suppose that cooperationis a single phenomenon with a unified causal explanation. We find it more plausible toview cooperation as a family of loosely related phenomena which may have multiplecauses. We offer our model as a stylised representation of one mechanism by whichcooperation might emerge and persist.Our model is unusually robust in that it assumes only materially self-interestedmotivations and applies to anonymous, well-mixed populations. In claiming this asa merit of the model, we do not deny that individuals sometimes act on pro-socialmotivations. It has long been known that experimental subjects often cooperate innon-repeated and anonymous Prisoner’s Dilemmas (Sally 1995).Nor do we deny that many recurrent cooperative interactions are between individ-uals who are known to one another, or that populations of potential cooperators areoften structured into clusters of individuals who interact mainly with their neighbours.Each of these factors can contribute to the explanation of cooperation in particularenvironments. Nevertheless, theories that depend on non-anonymity, or on populationstructures taking particular forms, have restricted domains of application. And sinceself-interest is a very common and reliable motivation, models which assume onlyself-interest can be expected to be particularly robust.As an illustration of how theories with less robust assumptions can be restrictedin their application, we consider the currently much-discussed hypothesis of altruis-tic punishment (Fehr and Gächter 2000; Gintis et al. 2005). The key insight is thatmultilateral cooperation can be sustained in equilibrium if individuals have low-costoptions of punishing one another, and if even a relatively small proportion of individ-uals have relatively weak preferences for punishing non-cooperators. However, thegeneral effectiveness of this mechanism depends on the cost of punishing being lowrelative to the harm inflicted, and on the absence of opportunities for punishees toretaliate (Herrmann et al. 2008; Nikiforakis 2008); and it requires that at least someindividuals have non-selfish preferences for punishing. Such preferences might besustained by cultural group selection in hunter-gatherer economies, where groups aresmall and inter-group warfare is frequent, but these conditions are not typical of themodern world; even among hunter-gatherers, biological group selection of altruistic123The emergence of reciprocally beneficial cooperationFig.3Replicatordynamicsfordifferentvaluesofc123S. Beraldo, R. Sugdenpunishment would be frustrated by inter-group gene flow (Boyd et al. 2005). Altru-istic punishment should be understood as a mechanism that can sustain cooperationin specific types of environment, not as the solution to the problem of explainingcooperation. We claim no more than this for our own model.We have said that our model is in the same spirit as some recent work by biologists,which finds apparently cooperative behaviour to be directly beneficial to the individualcooperator (see Sect. 1 above). But, as we now explain, the explanatory principles usedby these biologists are not the same as those exhibited in our model.One of the fundamental features of our model is that the cooperative behaviour itdescribes is reciprocally beneficial. By this, we mean the following. Such cooperationis not simply a unilateral action by one individual which, intentionally or unintention-ally, confers benefits on another; it is the composition of cooperative actions by twoor more individuals, the combined effect of which is to benefit each of them. In otherwords, each cooperator benefits from his action only if this action is reciprocated byone or more other individuals. In the absence of enforceable promises, reciprocallybeneficial cooperation requires at least one individual to choose a cooperative actionwithout assurance that others will reciprocate. In our model, any player who choosesto cooperate incurs a risk of loss, which is realised if his opponent cheats. One mightthink (as we are inclined to do) that reciprocal benefit is a hallmark of genuine, asopposed to apparent, cooperation (see also Sachs et al. 2004; West et al. 2007). In bio-logical models of mutualism, cooperation is not reciprocally beneficial, in the sensewe have defined.In the Snowdrift game, which is often used to model apparently cooperative animalbehaviour, cooperation and cheating are best responses to one another. In the originalstory, two drivers are stuck in the same snowdrift. Both drivers have shovels, and soeach can choose whether or not to dig. If either driver digs a way out for his own car,the other can drive out too. Each would rather be the only one to dig than remain stuck.This defines a game with Chicken payoffs; in a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium, onedriver digs and the other free-rides (Sugden 1986). Such an equilibrium is not a caseof reciprocally beneficial behaviour.Clutton-Brock (2009) offers the Soldier’s Dilemma as a model of mutualism inbiology. In this game, a patrol of soldiers is ambushed by the enemy. Soldiers who fireback attract incoming fire and increase their chance of being killed. By firing back,however, each individual reduces the probability that the patrol will be overrun. Thegain from this may be such that from an individual’s perspective there is no dilemmaat all: firing back may give the best chance of individual survival, irrespective ofwhat the others do. A biological equivalent to this game (or perhaps to Snowdrift)can be found in the behaviour of certain birds and mammals, such as Arabian bab-blers and meerkat, which feed in predator-rich environments. Individuals of thesespecies go on sentinel duty once they have fed for long enough to be close to satiation(Clutton-Brock et al. 1999). In these games, cooperation is chosen either as a dominantstrategy or as a best response to other players’ non-cooperation; it is not reciprocallybeneficial.In the story of the Soldier’s Dilemma, it would be natural to assume that cooper-ation would be a dominant strategy only if the number of soldiers in the patrol wasrelatively small, so that each of them received a significant share of the total benefit123The emergence of reciprocally beneficial cooperationcreated by his own cooperative action. Hauert et al. (2002) present a model which canbe understood as a version of the Soldier’s Dilemma in which the size of the patrolis endogenous. This is an n-player model of voluntary contributions to a public good,but with an outside option of non-participation. A player who takes the outside optionreceives a small positive payoff σ with certainty, but forgoes any share in the benefitsof the public good. Players who participate can either cooperate (contribute to thepublic good) or cheat (not contribute). Each cooperator incurs a cost of 1 and createsa benefit of r (where 1 < r < n and r > σ + 1), which is divided equally between allparticipants. This game has no pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. (If all of one’s oppo-nents take the outside option, the best response is to cooperate; if they all cooperate,the best response is to cheat; if they all cheat, the best response is the outside option.)There is a unique symmetrical mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium in which the expectedpayoff to all three strategies is σ . More intuitively, in equilibrium the expected num-ber of participants in each game is sufficiently small that cooperation and cheatingare equally profitable. Replicator dynamics have the Rock–Paper–Scissors cyclicalpattern.There are some similarities between Hauert et al.’s model and ours: both modelsinclude a non-participation option, and both induce mixed-strategy equilibria withpredator–prey characteristics. However, Hauert et al.’s model differs from ours in twosignificant ways. First, the mechanism that induces cooperation works through vari-ation in the number of participants in the cooperative activity. For this reason, themodel cannot represent cooperative activities which require a fixed number of partic-ipants. In particular, it cannot represent activities which inherently involve just twoindividuals—as, for example, most forms of market exchange do. Second, becausethe costs and benefits of contributing to the public good are non-stochastic, theexpected payoffs to cooperation, cheating and non-participation are equal in equi-librium. Thus, although some cooperative activity takes place in equilibrium, thisactivity generates no net benefit relative to non-participation: it is not reciprocallybeneficial.We suggest that our analysis provides a stylised but essentially realistic accountof a mechanism by which reciprocally beneficial cooperation can emerge and persistin anonymous, well-mixed populations in which strategies are selected according totheir material payoffs. Using two simple components—voluntary participation andstochastic payoffs—that have not previously been put together, we have constructeda robust general-purpose model of cooperation.We are conscious that, for some theoretically-oriented economists, the mechanismwe have described may seem rather prosaic. For decades, the Prisoner’s Dilemmahas been used as the paradigm model of cooperation problems, and the problem ofexplaining cooperation in that game has been treated as a supreme theoretical chal-lenge. Viewed in that perspective, a modelling strategy which relaxes the assumptionthat cooperation is always a dominated strategy may seem too easy. But we sharethe view of Worden and Levin (2007) that many real-world cooperation problemsare less intractable than the Prisoner’s Dilemma. Neglecting these cases results in anincomplete body of theory and fosters unwarranted pessimism about the possibilityof spontaneous cooperation.123S. Beraldo, R. SugdenMathematical appendixProof of Result 2 Let (β, π) be any interior or boundary equilibrium, and consider anyplayer i . With probability F(β), xi < β and i plays N orD. In an interior equilibrium,VD = VN = 0. In a boundary equilibrium, VD ≥ VN = 0 and N is not played. Ineither case, i’s expected payoff is equal to VD and is non-negative. With probability1 –F(β), xi ≥ β and i plays C. If xi = β, i is indifferent between C and D and theexpected payoff is again VD . If xi > β, i plays C; his expected payoff (conditionalon xi > β) exceeds that in the xi = β case by [1 – F(β)](xi –β); here 1 – F(β)represents the probability that i’s opponent plays C. Hence:V ∗(β, π) = VD + [1 − F(β)] E [max(xi − β, 0)] , (8)where E is the expectation operator. Since VD ≥ 0 and β < xmax, the value ofV ∗(β, π) is strictly positive.Proof of Result 3 If (β, π) and (β ′, π ′) are both interior and/or boundary equilibria,Result 3 can be derived from (8) using the fact thatVD is decreasing inβ [an implicationof (2)]. If (β, π) is the non-participation equilibrium, V ∗(β, π) = 0 and so Result 3follows trivially from Result 2.Proof of Result 4 Suppose xmax > ab/c. Let (β, π) be the highest-value F equilib-rium and let (β ′, π ′) be the highest-value Gequilibrium. There are three possibilities.Case 1: (β, π) and (β ′, π ′) are both interior equilibria. Then β ′ = β = ab/c andπ ′ > π . (This case is illustrated in Fig. 2.) Since G(β ′) < F(β), the frequency ofcooperation is higher in the G equilibrium. Using (8) and the fact that VD = 0 inevery interior equilibrium, it can be shown that the value of the game is strictly greaterin the G equilibrium. Case 2: (β, π) and (β ′, π ′) are both boundary equilibria. Then(because the CM locus forG lies outside the CM locus for F) β ′ < β and π ′ = π = 1.Since G(β ′) < F(β), the frequency of cooperation is higher in the G equilibrium.Using (2), it can be shown that VD is strictly greater in the G equilibrium. Then,using (8) in relation to the distributions F and G, it can be shown that the value ofthe game is strictly greater in the G equilibrium. Case 3: (β, π) is an interior equi-librium and (β ′, π ′) is a boundary equilibrium. Then β ′ ≤ β and 1 = π ′ > π . SinceG(β ′) < F(β), the frequency of cooperation is higher in the G equilibrium. In theinterior equilibrium, VD = 0. In the boundary equilibrium, VD ≥ 0. Then, using (8),it can be shown that the value of the game is strictly greater in the G equilibrium.Mathematical details of replicator-dynamic analysisAs explained in Sect. 5, our simulations assume that, at any given time t , all play-ers are characterised by the same (β, π) pair. Under this assumption, and given ourassumptions about the distribution of X , the frequency of cooperation and cheating inthe population can be expressed aspC (t) = 1 − F(β(t)) = xmax − β(t)xmax(9)123The emergence of reciprocally beneficial cooperationandpD(t) = (1 − pC (t))π(t) =(β(t)xmax)· π(t) (10)respectively.

As explained in Sect. 5, the payoff to eachstrategy at t is defined as the expected payoff from that strategy for a player i forwhom xi = β(t).

Because game theoretic analyses typically conclude that a psychology designed for direct reciprocity should defect in such situations, many have concluded that alternative explanations for human generosity—explanations beyond direct reciprocity—are necessary. However, human cooperation evolved within a material and informational ecology: Simply adding consideration of one minimal ecological relationship to the analysis of reciprocity brings theory and observation closer together, indicating that ecology-free analyses of cooperation can be fragile. Using simulations, we show that the autocorrelation of an individual’s location over time means that even a chance encounter with an individual predicts an increased probability of a future encounter with that same individual. We discuss how a psychology designed for such an ecology may be expected to often cooperate even in apparently one-shot situations. Cue-Value of Encounter 3  Cooperation in humans is ubiquitous, richly variable in form, and complex in organization. We cooperate in an enormous range of endeavors with both kin and non-kin, exchange a wide range of goods and activities, and even cooperate in large, flexible groups of overlapping membership. These facts have led to an intense debate over whether human cooperation emerges from the same selective dynamics that are widely believed to have produced cooperation in most other species1-3 (e.g., kin selection, reciprocation), or whether qualitatively different selective dynamics are needed to explain human sociality4-6. Much of the motivation for abandoning traditional explanations has centered on the empirical results of experimental economic games, played both among undergraduates in developed nations and among members of small-scale populations7-13. By design, these games are often anonymous and one-shot: Players never learn who their co-players are and play the game just once. Although there would appear to be no way to benefit from cooperative strategies in such one-shot games, many players nonetheless choose to be generous—e.g., by cooperating in a one-shot prisoners’ dilemma or allocating money to a co-player when the player could have kept it all4,6,14-16. These findings have, in part, led many researchers to conclude that higher-order forms of selection are necessary to explain human cooperation, such as cultural or genetic group selection or gene–culture coevolution5,17-23. These researchers typically make the critical assumption that the design of these experiments rule out traditional explanations for cooperation: Proponents of this view maintain that theories invoking reciprocity2,24-27 cannot explain such results because the interactions are stipulated to never repeat; that theories invoking reputation28 cannot explain the results because anonymity precludes anyone learning of a player’s behavior; and that theories invoking kin selection3,29 cannot explain the results, because interactants are not Cue-Value of Encounter 4  genetic kin. With these explanations apparently ruled out, it seems logical to conclude that some other evolutionary dynamic must be at work.  However, this line of argument suffers from a serious flaw: direct reciprocity and kin selection are general models of selection pressures, not theories of the phenotypic designs that these selection pressures construct independent of circumstances. The ways that selection pressures impact the design of organisms’ minds and bodies necessarily depends on the material and informational structure of the environments in which a particular species evolved and is therefore designed to operate within. To generate a model of an organism’s phenotypic design, general theories of selection must be combined with data on the idiosyncratic material and informational structure of a species’ environment.  For example, for kin selection models to work3, organisms must cause assistance to be delivered to genetic relatives, suggesting that evolved systems of kin detection should accompany systems of kin assistance. Indeed, many species, such as humans, have cognitive mechanisms for identifying probable genetic relatives for use in regulating cooperative and mating behavior30-32. However, while kin selection applies broadly, kin detection mechanisms are selected only when material and informational ecologies have a particular form. Other ecologies, and hence other psychologies, are possible. Consider a hypothetical species of wasp where females lay their eggs inside figs. Females mate only once and only lay eggs in figs untouched by other females. In this case, a newborn wasp will meet only full siblings; it does not need any psychological mechanisms that allow it to distinguish kin from non-kin within the fig. This hypothetical wasp’s perinatal environment has a structure that does not require kin detection mechanisms—even if kin selection were an active selective dynamic33. Selection will set a Cue-Value of Encounter 5  default level of altruism inside the fig, without the wasp needing to possess kin detection mechanisms. It is similarly necessary to consider the ancestral material and informational ecology to predict how selective dynamics would have shaped the human cooperative architecture. Given the social and natural ecology that humans actually evolved in, would theories like direct reciprocity suffice to create a psychology that cooperates to some extent in games that seem one-shot, or would higher-order selection in fact be necessary? As has been discussed by other authors10, multiple features of the ecology faced by ancestral humans suggest that selection for direct reciprocity might create psychologies willing to cooperate even in (likely rare) anonymous and one-shot conditions. One important feature is that social interactions in the real world (both ancestral and present day) involve a high degree of uncertainty. First, there is uncertainty over relative valuation, as valuations in both present and ancestral real world environments are often implicit and heterogeneous across individuals. For example, one party may misestimate the value another party places upon a resource with drastic strategic consequences: If I underestimate the value of a resource to you, I may take it and unintentionally incur your wrath34. Although the stakes in experimental games are often explicit with clear monetary values attached, the relative value between individuals can still be ambiguous; a player in need may place a greater internal valuation on a given stake than others do. Second, there is uncertainty over the spread of reputation. In experimental games, experimenters often go to great lengths to (i) ensure that subjects’ behavior will be kept confidential, and (ii) communicate this fact to subjects35. In contrast, in the real world, both now and ancestrally, situations hardly, if ever, contain such certainty—there is always a chance of being observed by agents whose presence is undetected. Indeed, even highly controlled Cue-Value of Encounter 6  experimental games may have residual uncertainty: Although assurances from an experimenter might be strong predictors of anonymity, other cues, such as knowledge that other players are community members, point in the opposite direction36. Third, there is uncertainty over a relationship’s time horizon. In experimental games, situations are often structured so as to occur only once before the experiment is concluded, and in concert with the anonymity this fact should preclude any future consequences from game behavior. In contrast, in the real world the future of nearly every interaction is uncertain and, because of this, analytic and simulation results show that selection favors decision rules that are generous even in apparently one-shot encounters1. Although many features of ancestral human ecology, in concert with selection pressures for direct reciprocity, might create psychologies willing to cooperate in anonymous and one-shot conditions, here we focus on a single, simple feature: encountering someone now probabilistically predicts encountering that person again. Indeed, the only event that uniquely precludes the possibility of future interactions is the death of one of the interactants. Aside from this case, the probability of future encounter may be decidedly greater than zero. Why might encounter probabilistically predict reencounter? The world is a complex causal system, and whatever causal forces went into encountering a particular individual, to the extent that these forces persist over time, they are more likely than chance to cause re-encounter37. For example, the world is large relative to an individual’s ability to navigate within it, especially under ancestral conditions without modern transportation technology. Thus, an individual’s location will be autocorrelated over time. That two individuals are in the same place at the same time—conditions necessary for encounter—suggests that they have a higher than baseline chance of a future encounter based merely on the autocorrelation of location. Cue-Value of Encounter 7  A large literature explores the effects of spatiality (or viscosity) on the evolutionary dynamics of cooperative strategies. Viscosity, for example, in the dispersal of offspring can lead to designs for cooperation gaining a larger share of the benefits of cooperation than in other environments (but at the same time can lead to greater competition among kin for access to local resources)38-40. As in the wasp example, viscosity may also relax selection on kin detection leading to less discriminant cooperation, but can also expose patches of cooperators to roving exploiters41. Yet, one facet of a spatially viscous ecology that has gone relatively unexplored is the impact of spatial viscosity on re-encounter rates. In other words, while viscosity limits the dispersal of genes in a spatial environment, raising genetic assortment, it also limits the dispersal of agents in a social environment, potentially raising re-encounter rates.  When environments are structured such that encounter predicts re-encounter, natural selection might favor phenotypic designs that act as if conspecifics encountered now will be re-encountered. To the extent that the human mind is designed to act as if it expected repeated interactions, humans will be more cooperative in apparently one-shot or short-term interactions than a retrospective or omniscient analysis would predict. Game theoretic analyses show that if an interaction is one-shot or has a clear, finite endpoint then the payoff-maximizing behavior is to defect. But real minds necessarily have access to only limited and imperfect information—it is impossible to know for certain whether an interaction will be one-shot or will repeat indefinitely into the future. Thus, although some cues in a current interaction might suggest it is one-shot (e.g., the interactants are strangers), if encountering someone now predicts encountering them again, selection might create cooperative psychologies that expect this correlation. Such an expectation will lead to greater default levels of cooperation. Moreover, the strength of this Cue-Value of Encounter 8  expectation—and thus default levels of cooperation—should increase in proportion to the strength of the correlation between encountering someone now and encountering them again. It is critical to note that such expectations are not necessarily conscious or articulable; instead, they might be implicit in the design of the mechanisms that generate cooperative decisions. This is analogous to human color constancy mechanisms: The visual system expects a certain spectrum of wavelengths as produced by long-enduring celestial and terrestrial light sources. This expectation is, of course, not conscious or articulable. Moreover, it can be fooled by anomalous, modern experiences, such as artificial lighting in a nighttime parking lot giving rise to the illusion that a yellow car is blue42. Analytic and simulation studies of the evolution of reciprocity show that selection can build extremely strong implicit expectations of repeat encounters. Such expectations can cause high levels of cooperation even in situations where agents have explicit, articulable beliefs that an interaction is one-shot1. In other words, people might have reportable beliefs that an interaction is one-shot but, because of the expectations embodied in their evolved cooperative psychology, they cooperate nonetheless. Our goal here is to use simulations to explore how the spatial structure of ancestral ecologies affects whether people will re-encounter each other. While human life is intricately complex, in these simulations we include only the most basic of assumptions—that the world has spatial extent, that agents can move within it, that agents encounter each other when they are nearby—so that our results are as generalizable as possible. It is impossible to believe the world of our ancestors lacked these minimal features. We conducted a series of 8,250 simulations to determine whether—under these minimal assumptions—encountering someone now predicts encountering them in the future. We also test the degree to which this relationship is dependent upon quantitative features of the social ecology. (Simulations were written in Java by author Cue-Value of Encounter 9  M.M.K, and checked for errors by author A.W.D. Source code is available upon request to author M.M.K.) In these simulations a population of agents was allowed to randomly navigate a simulated world; throughout, the simulation recorded which other agents they encountered along the way.   Results Simulation Details To parameterize our simulated environment, we consulted the average living conditions of traditionally living populations reported by Marlowe43. Marlowe reports the averages of two samples: the average population density across all surveyed groups was .25 persons/km2 with an average local group area of approximately 1600 km2; for the subset warm climate non-equestrian sample—thought by Marlowe to better represent ancestral conditions—the average population density was .31 persons/km2 with an average local group area of approximately 500 km2. To approximate this range of conditions, we simulated populations of 125, 250 and 500 agents. Assuming the 1600 km2 living area of the full sample, this yields a population density ranging from .08-.31 persons/km2, enclosing the mean of the full sample (.25); assuming the 500 km2 living area of the ancestrally representative sample, this yields a population density ranging from .25-1.0 persons/km2, enclosing the mean of the ancestrally representative sample (.31). As illustrated by Table 1, population size contributed to approximately 0.00% of the variance in re-encounter rate, suggesting that differences in population density within even a range this large are relatively unimportant.  In each simulation run n ∈	ሼ125,	250,	500ሽ agents were each randomly assigned a location within a two-dimensional space with sides 1 arbitrary unit long. How this space maps Cue-Value of Encounter 10  onto real area depends on assumptions that cannot be known with certainty. As described in the previous paragraph, this space could be viewed as 1600 km2 or 500 km2; either way the population densities within this space represent reasonable values for small-scale societies. To test for the existence of edge-effects, this space was sampled twice: once with hard edges which constrained agents’ movements (agents’ movements perpendicular to an encountered edge were truncated at the edge), and once without edges such that space wrapped seamlessly from top-to-bottom and left-to-right. On each of 500 time steps these agents moved by drawing a random distance from a normal distribution with mean of 0 and a standard deviation d	∈	ሼ.01,	.02,	.03,	.04,	.05ሽ, and a random angle ϴ~Uሺ0,	360ሻ. If the distance drawn was negative, the agent moved in the direction opposite to the drawn angle. Assuming the population density of Marlowe’s43 full sample, these walking distance parameter values represent an average movement between 0.17 km (for n = 125 & d = .01) and 1.78 km (for n = 500 & d = .05) every time step (and movements larger than 0.44 km and 4.47 km, respectively, 4.6% of the time). These movements could be thought of as frequent, periodic foraging trips, or other less frequent transitions; as illustrated by Fig 1, the rates of encounter and re-encounter are extremely stable over all but the final time steps in a simulation run. This suggests that our choice of 500 time steps had little impact on the qualitative effects in our simulation. Indeed, a greater number of time steps would have only strengthened our effect, increasing the likelihood that a person encountered now will be encountered later. Moreover, a much smaller number of time steps would be unrealistic: On almost any interpretation of what a time step represents, several hundred over the course of a forager’s lifespan would be likely. Finally, the number of time steps per run was chosen to give an adequate sampling without introducing the computational burden Cue-Value of Encounter 11  of simulating longer, yet informationally redundant runs, allowing easier direct replicability by other researchers.  At each time step, for each agent, the program evaluated if another agent was within a defined meeting radius r	∈	ሼ.005,	.01,	.015,	.02,	.025ሽ; if so, the program recorded that the two agents met during this time step. Assuming the average ecology of Marlowe’s43 sample, these meeting radius parameter values represent a range between 0.11 km (for n = 125 & r = .005) and 1.12 km (for n = 500 & r = .025) wherein agents would be considered encountered.  After a run was completed, we computed for each time step: (1) The average re-encounter rate: For each agent, we computed the proportion of other agents encountered during that time step who were re-encountered in the future; these values were then averaged across agents. (2) The average encounter base rate: For each agent, we computed the proportion of all other agents (regardless of whether they met this time step) who were encountered in any future time step; these values were then averaged across agents. The re-encounter rate is a conditional probability: Given that two agents are meeting in this time step, it is the probability they will meet in a future time step. The encounter base rate quantifies, irrespective of any additional information during this time step, the probability that two agents will meet in a future time step. The difference of these two values gives the “autocorrelation effect”: the marginal increase in the probability of future encounter given present encounter in a spatial world. Randomness—independent of any effects of spatiality—can cause agents to encounter each other in the future. Computing the autocorrelation effect allows us to quantify how spatiality affects re-encounter rates. The strength of the autocorrelation effect depends on the extent to which spatiality affects agents’ social interactions; this is manipulated across simulations by the walking distance and Cue-Value of Encounter 12  meeting radius parameters. Increasing walking distance should lead to a smaller autocorrelation effect. To see this, consider what happens if the walking distance approaches infinity. If so, then the probability of two agents meeting now is unaffected by where they were located previously; this would imply that a person is just as likely to encounter someone living kilometers away as they are to encounter their next-door neighbor. Although there will be re-encounters in this case—you might randomly meet your neighbor or the distant person again—spatiality per se would have no effect on the rates of re-encounter.  Decreasing meeting radius should also lead to a smaller autocorrelation effect. Consider what happens as the meeting radius approaches zero: It will be almost impossible to ever meet anyone, pushing re-encounter rates and base rates of encounter to zero; when both rates take the same value (viz., zero), there is no autocorrelation effect. At the limit of infinitely small meeting radius people would not meet or interact with others standing next to them. (We only studied values for meeting radius that were relatively small compared to the total size of the population’s range. If the meeting radius was large, encompassing most of the range, we would also expect no autocorrelation effect. In this case, however, both re-encounter rate and encounter based rates would be very high. This would occur because all agents would constantly be encountering every other agent. Thus, over a very broad range the relationship between meeting radius and the autocorrelation effect would be an inverse U-shape.) Fifty runs were completed at each combination of n, d, r	and edges state yielding 7500 runs. These aggregated re-encounter rates and their margins over baseline (the autocorrelation effect) were analyzed in a general linear model (GLM) framework to produce estimates of effect size (Tabs. 1 and 2). An additional 50 runs were completed at each combination of n & r such that each agent’s location was completely random in the current time step relative to its location Cue-Value of Encounter 13  in the previous time step (totaling 750 additional simulation runs). This models the null case of a world without autocorrelation of location over time and was accomplished by setting d = 1 (effectively, d approached infinity in these runs).   Findings Our analysis makes two related claims. First, given even the most minimal assumptions, encountering someone now should predict encountering them again. This is measured by re-encounter rate. Selection can use the quantitative level of this rate to set default levels of cooperation. Second, the re-encounter rate should be partially a function of how spatiality affects social encounters. This is measured as the autocorrelation effect (the re-encounter rate minus the base rate of encounter). Were individuals encountered in the present likely to be encountered again in the future? Yes, re-encounter rates were sizeable: As depicted in Fig. 1, across the range of both walking distance (Fig. 1a) and meeting radius (Fig. 1b) agents encountered on a given time step were often re-encountered. For instance, at the median walking distance (d = .03), encountering someone now meant there was approximately a 50% chance of meeting them again within the arbitrary time frame. Similarly, at the median meeting radius (r = .015), encountering someone now meant there was approximately a 60% chance of meeting them again. As such, and given an ecology where cooperation yielded gains in trade, an agent could profit from a design expressing the default expectation that those she encountered may be encountered again and were potentially profitable cooperation partners. Holding parameters constant, re-encounter rate was highly stable across much of an agent’s life, only falling off around the final few time steps. Considering the GLM estimates for re-encounter rate, shorter distances walked lead to higher re-Cue-Value of Encounter 14  encounter rates, and walking distance accounted for 8.3% of all variance in re-encounter rates (Table 1). Larger meeting radii lead to higher re-encounter rates, and meeting radius accounted for 13.9% of all variance in re-encounter rates. Although raw re-encounter rates are the ecological value that should be used by selection in designing cooperative psychology, our analysis predicts that re-encounter rates will be affected by how spatiality affects sociality. Was the spatiality of social interactions important in setting raw re-encounter rates? Yes, this can be seen in autocorrelation effects. As depicted in Figs. 1c,d and Fig. 2, the marginal increase in future encounter was substantial. For instance, at the median walking distance (d = .03), the autocorrelation effect increased the probability of future encounter given present encounter by a margin of over 30%. Similarly, at the median meeting radius (r = .015), the autocorrelation effect increased the probability of future encounter given present encounter by a margin of over 40%.  To illustrate the effect of spatiality and autocorrelation on determining re-encounter rates, Fig. 2 graphs the base rates of encounter and the re-encounter rates separately. This figure reveals the generally large differences between these two measures, and therefore the generally large effect of autocorrelation in location on re-encounter rate. As expected, this autocorrelation effect diminished as walking distance increased, eventually being eliminated once agents walked so far that the locations were no longer autocorrelated (d = 1, non-spatial baseline); see right-most columns in Fig. 2. Note that when locations were no longer autocorrelated raw re-encounter rates were still sometimes sizeable. Nonetheless, they were no different than encounter base rates, showing that autocorrelation was not the cause of these high re-encounter rates. Walking distance accounted for 16.6% of the variance in the autocorrelation effect (Table 2). Cue-Value of Encounter 15  Also as expected, within each walking distance lower values of the meeting radius led to a smaller autocorrelation effect; see Fig. 2. Although we did not conduct simulations analogous to the walking distance case where autocorrelation is entirely removed, reflection can illustrate this for meeting radius. Imagine that meeting radius is reduced to zero. Agents never meet any other agents, necessarily eliminating the differences between re-encounter rates and encounter base rates, as both are zero. Meeting radius accounted for 11.2% of the variance in the autocorrelation effect (Table 2). There was also a small recency effect observed most in large walking distances and large meeting radii, which can be seen in the upward trending slopes before the end of life declines in Figs 1c & 1d. The autocorrelation effect reached a maximum for recent time steps and dissipated as the encounter faded back into the past. Finally, we note that there was little effect of whether edges stopped movement or whether edges wrapped seamlessly (see Tables 1 and 2).  Discussion The simulation presented here rests on extremely plausible, extremely minimal assumptions: If the world has spatial extent, is large relative to agents’ ability to navigate in it, and an agent’s time horizon extends beyond the immediate present, then merely encountering an agent once predicts a higher chance of encountering them again. These minimal assumptions were almost certainly true throughout human evolution. This suggests that natural selection will have calibrated our cooperative psychology in light of these realities. It is exceedingly simple for natural selection to exploit this environmental regularity to improve the performance of the cooperative architecture: in the absence of other information suggesting whether there will or will not be future interactions with an interaction partner, have a default expectation that re-Cue-Value of Encounter 16  encounter was the ancestral average1. These results obtain even when no organismal or environmental structure otherwise correlates agents’ movements. Yet in reality, both organism and environmental structure would strongly have correlated agents’ movements, thus greatly amplifying the degree to which an encounter predicted reencounter compared to the minimal case where agents are moving randomly. That is, unconnected foragers would have shared many of the same goals in the same local environment (e.g., different individuals frequently visited the same sources of food, water, shelter, refuge, mates). Any such structure, such as a common attractant like a stable resource patch or repellent like a stable environmental hazard, by systematically causing agents to cluster at or disperse from a particular location, would serve to increase the rate of re-encounter. For a species like humans where individuals possess specialized knowledge and skills such that the gains in trade from cooperation are often large, these results imply that—in order to cultivate such valuable relationships—the mind should be designed to assume by default that the probability of a repeat interaction with a newly encountered stranger is far greater than zero. Note that this reasoning does not predict that a default cooperative psychology should be common among species; we may share a spatial ecology with other species on the planet, but it is this ecological fact in concert with the possibility of large benefits through cooperation that can select for such a psychology. Delton et al.1 find that, under reasonable parameterization, cooperation in uncertain one-shot circumstances evolves only when the average gains in trade from cooperation are larger than two or three times the cost. While this is a low hurdle for particular instances of cooperation, it is hard to see how this could characterize the interactions of non-human animals on average throughout their lives.  Cue-Value of Encounter 17  Although we argue that re-encounter rate creates psychologies that (probably implicitly) assume or act as if interactions will be repeated, we are not arguing that this implies humans should always cooperate or be generous. In making any cooperative decision, the mind should integrate a number of situational cues along with any default assumptions. Some cues may make cooperation more likely: For instance, in laboratory samples of economic games, subjects in the experiments are often of similar age, attending the same school if not the same classes; in anthropological samples, subjects are often all members of the same face-to-face communities. In contrast, other cues may make cooperation less likely, such as a past history of aggressive interaction.  To be clear, these simulations suggest that selection acting on the human cooperative architecture might have had two different, related effects on its design. First, the evolutionary long-run degree to which one encounter predicted repeat encounters would have made the architecture’s default probability of cooperating higher than previously appreciated.  Second, the architecture might have been selected to include detection systems to monitor within-lifespan local parameters that provide cues to the degree to which one encounter predicts another. This would suggest that greater autocorrelation in location (less travel) should increase cooperativeness.  More importantly, this work is simply a modest illustration of how theories of cooperation (and any other psychological adaptation) need to be fleshed out by taking explicit account of the local material and informational ecologies. That such a minor factor as location autocorrelation can potentially shift best-bet reciprocity responses suggests that when all relevant features of the world are taken into account, an efficient reciprocity–exchange architecture might look very different than how it is usually conceived.  Cue-Value of Encounter 18  Beyond evidence that humans often cooperate in one-shot and anonymous interactions, stable cross-cultural differences in cooperative behaviors have also been advanced to support cultural group selection and gene–culture co-evolutionary theories of human cooperation6,44. These proposals argue, not implausibly, that differential rates of cooperative behaviors across societies are due to these societies having different cultural norms and institutions. But although viable, a cultural explanation is not the only possible explanation. An alternative explanation would be that the same universal evolved cooperative architecture is designed to be calibrated by the detection of local magnitudes of ecological factors that affected the payoffs of cooperative relationships ancestrally. For example, stable differences in the numbers of social partners and kin present in the vicinity are plausible input parameters to facultative mechanisms for cooperativeness and generosity—factors that themselves might be partial functions of the degree of autocorrelation in location. That is, what are commonly interpreted as “cultural differences” may turn out to be outputs produced by ecological and demographic inputs to our evolved psychology. In support of this view, recent research suggests that variance comparable to that found between cultures can also be found among communities of a single culture—communities that share the same norms and institutions7. If different locations in the same culture present the same variability as different cultures do, this implies that noncultural factors could be responsible for between culture variability as well.  Mathematical and simulation work also provides alternative explanations for cross-cultural differences, explanations that do not rely on higher-order levels of selection. Delton et al.1 show that cooperation, even in apparent one-shot encounters, increases as the gains in trade from cooperation increase. Although humans, compared to other species, have flourished by finding and exploiting possible gains in trade, modern societies have unlocked enormous gains in Cue-Value of Encounter 19  trade not possible in small-scale, face-to-face societies. On this view, it is not surprising that behaviors like cooperation and generosity are observed at higher rates in societies with (e.g.) more market integration44. To be clear, what is at issue is not whether humans have developed novel institutions and cultural practices that make modern life possible. What is at issue is why human cooperation and generosity exist and vary as they do. We suggest that human cooperation and generosity are not an accident of birth, a lucky draw in a lottery of cultural milieus. Instead, they are facultative elements in a universal human nature.

To this end, this commentary addresses how novel mutualisms inform our understanding of mutualism formation, stability, the importance of functional traits, and niche vs. neutral processes, using examples across multiple systems.

Prior research finds that people can detect these signs of altruism in strangers, but we do not yet know whether this results in altruism homophily. We argue that dispositions should matter less in repeated interactions, where behavior is based on reciprocity. As a consequence, we should not expect people to have accurate insight into the dispositions (egoism vs. altruism) of their friends, nor should we expect these relations to be characterized by altruism homophily. Three studies, employing diverse methodologies and measures, find no evidence of altruism homophily. Moreover, we find that people have poor insight into their friends ’ altruism.

Many Systems Intelligent actions have the effect of uncovering the hidden potential for cooperation in a human context. An understanding of the nature and conditions for the emergence of cooperation therefore provides a useful background for the discipline of Systems Intelligence. Forms of cooperation can emerge in repeated interactions even between self-regarding parties with simple behavioural strategies, but both everyday experience and laboratory experiments indicate that humans have cooperative tendencies that cannot be explained with the model of material self-interest. A large portion of people seem to have intrinsic, non-material, social preferences that can be modelled as strong reciprocity.

Enhanced Mutualism Hypothesis,103542834,The Psychology of Coordination and Common Knowledge,,"Kyle A. Thomas, Peter Descioli, Omar Sultan Haque, Steven Pinker",2016,"Research on human cooperation has concentrated on the puzzle of altruism, in which 1 actor incurs a cost to benefit another, and the psychology of reciprocity, which evolved to solve this problem. We examine the complementary puzzle of mutualism, in which actors can benefit each other simultaneously, and the psychology of coordination, which ensures such benefits. Coordination is facilitated by common knowl-edge: the recursive belief state in which A knows X, B knows X, A knows that B knows X, B knows that A knows X, ad infinitum. We test whether people are sensitive to common knowledge when deciding whether to engage in risky coordination. Participants decided between working alone for a certain profit and working together for a potentially higher profit that they would receive only if their partner made the same choice. Results showed that more participants attempted risky coordination when they and their prospective partner had common knowledge of the payoffs (broadcast over a loudspeaker) than when they had only shared knowledge (conveyed to both by a messenger) or private knowledge (revealed to each partner separately). These results support the hypothesis that people represent common knowledge as a distinct cognitive category that licenses them to coordinate with others for mutual gain.

We develop an evolutionary dynamics model to investigate how network homophily influences the evolution of the pay-it-forward reciprocity. Manipulating the extent to which actors carrying the same behavioral trait are linked in networks, the computer simulation model shows that strong network homophily helps consolidate the adaptive advantage of cooperation, yet introducing some heterophily to the formation of network helps advance cooperation's scale further.

Enhanced Mutualism Hypothesis,480128636,Modeling pluralism and self-regulation explains the emergence of cooperation in networked societies,10.1038/s41598-021-98524-5,"Madeo D., Salvatore S., Mannarini T., Mocenni C.",2021,"Understanding the dynamics of cooperative behavior of individuals in complex societies represents a fundamental research question which puzzles scientists working in heterogeneous fields. Many studies have been developed using the unitary agent assumption, which embeds the idea that when making decisions, individuals share the same socio-cultural parameters. In this paper, we propose the ECHO-EGN model, based on Evolutionary Game Theory, which relaxes this strong assumption by considering the heterogeneity of three fundamental socio-cultural aspects ruling the behavior of groups of people: the propensity to be more cooperative with members of the same group (Endogamic cooperation), the propensity to cooperate with the public domain (Civicness) and the propensity to prefer connections with members of the same group (Homophily). The ECHO-EGN model is shown to have high performance in describing real world behavior of interacting individuals living in complex environments. Extensive numerical experiments allowing the comparison of real data and model simulations confirmed that the introduction of the above mechanisms enhances the realism in the modelling of cooperation dynamics. Additionally, theoretical findings allow us to conclude that endogamic cooperation may limit significantly the emergence of cooperation",,info:eu-repo/semantics/article,"cultural pluralism, game theory, cooperation",,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC'
Enhanced Mutualism Hypothesis,45903934,Human cooperative behavior,,"Semmann, D.",2004,"Summary Evolutionary theory provides the biological sciences, with a fundamental and powerful model to explain the emergence of cooperative behavior. A detailed explanation for the existence of cooperation between related individuals is provided by the theory of kin selection. When kin cooperate the helper gives the receiver an advantage and thereby increases the relative probability that copies of his own genes are present in the next generations. However, one cannot explain examples of apparent altruism through kin selection, because in these cases unrelated individuals interact. The answer for many of these examples is provided by the theory of reciprocal altruism, where individuals behave reciprocal by returning help to a previous donor. By applying these two theories it is possible to explain many, but by far not all cooperative situations. There have to be other mechanisms that lead to cooperation and sustain already established cooperation. In my dissertation I have tested empirically new models and predictions of how cooperation between unrelated humans can be established. This research is especially important because we interact in a close net of relationships, where cooperation between unrelated individuals plays one of the main roles. Modern human societies are impossible to imagine without cooperation between unrelated individuals. By identifying the circumstances under which cooperation is stable between unrelated individuals, it will be possible to understand the deciding factors in politics, economy and in our private lives. As a consequence we would be provided with intellectual tools to positively influence the deciding factors by alternating the circumstances accordingly. We are often not aware of the importance of cooperation between unrelated partners in our daily lives. Regularly people find unconsciously cooperative solutions, for instance when they try simultaneously to walk through a narrow door. Some professions depend very strongly on cooperative behavior between unrelated colleagues. To act uncooperatively in such a profession can endanger the health or even the lives of the colleagues (e.g. firemen and firewoman). Cooperative strategies for these kinds of situations have to have evolved and need to be evolutionary stable, otherwise we would hardly ever find cooperative behavior in the present and then only between related individuals. According to the evolutionary theory the cooperative strategies found today, also have to provide an advantage to the bearer. For a long time economists and biologists have been interested in the emergence and sustainability of cooperative behavior. Nevertheless, only with the introduction of game theory, a mathematical basis was established to incorporate this behavior into biological evolutionary models. From then on it was possible to make predictions with the help of theoretical models, about the circumstances under which certain behavioral patterns emerge and what underlying mechanisms possibly sustain these patterns. In my dissertation I have empirically tested predictions of circumstances that promote cooperative behavior between unrelated humans. The main results of my work are the following: (i) Humans often donate money to charity. On first sight this seems to be a disadvantageous behavioral trait. Donations to charity include costs that reduce the direct fitness of the individual. However, it has to be beneficial to the bearer, otherwise it would be eliminated from the population through evolutionary processes. The study showed that there is indeed an advantage. By donating money to charity (here to UNICEF) one builds up a good personal reputation in the own social group. Participants that donated to UNICEF received with higher probability help from other participants and were as well more likely to be voted the group representative. (ii) Reputation is known to be an important currency in indirect reciprocity games. Humans therefore should also try to establish a good reputation in other social games, when this reputation is known in future indirect reciprocity games. Humans are in general unable to sustain a public resource that everybody is free to overuse anonymously. Is it possible that humans sustain a public resource if the use of the resource is linked to the personal reputation? The experiment showed, that the risk of loosing a good reputation by overusing the public resource actually lead to sustaining it. Furthermore the public resource was not only sustained, but also turned out to be surprisingly profitable to all group members. (iii) A theoretical model supplied a new possibility to sustain a public resource and hereby make humans act cooperatively. The strikingly simple idea was to introduce the possibility not to participate in the public goods group and instead use a personal resource with a low but sure payoff. The prediction was an always recurring rise to dominance, of three strategies ((a) not to participate in the public goods group, (b) participate in the public goods group and to cooperate within the group or (c) participate and to defect within the group) within the population. This dynamic was expected because whenever most members of the population choose the same strategy, one of the other two strategies had a higher payoff. The same type as the predicted dynamic has also been found in models of the famous children game of “rock-paper-scissors”. The model predicted that the public resource is sustained by the ongoing dynamic, which is liked with a recurring rise of cooperative behavior. Is it enough to supply humans with the possibility not to participate in the public goods game to produce such recurring rise of cooperation? The dynamic was established as predicted, whereby the changing dominance of the three strategies with repeated cooperative phases could be observed and the resource was on average sustained. (iv) When humans make decisions about using a public resource, which at some times are reputation relevant and at other times are not reputation relevant, do they use this information strategically? In this study it was shown that, humans are aware when their decisions are not reputation relevant and immediately reduce their cooperation to maximize their personal profit. Once more, as soon as the decisions about using the public resource were linked to the reputation, cooperation was much higher and the resource was sustained. (v) In some potentially cooperative situations humans’ meet partners from outside the own social group. These “strangers” have a reputation that they have built in another social group. Do humans put a different value on a strangers’ reputation in comparison to the reputation of members of the own social group? It was shown that it is not relevant if the reputation was built within the own or in a foreign social group. In summary we found the following: Humans behave uncooperatively, when it is to the personal advantage. However, certain circumstances lead to cooperative behavior in humans. Reputation building is one of the most important mechanisms in this context, which enables us to cooperate even with not related strangers. However humans consciously make strategic use of situations where they do not harm their reputation by behaving uncooperatively. Nevertheless, even in completely anonymous situations it is possible to create circumstances, like introducing optional participation in the public goods situations, which promote cooperative behavior in humans.Contents Summary 7 Zusammenfassung 11 Introduction 1 Cooperation 17 2 Game Theory 18 3 General approach to testing 20 4 Thesis outline 23 Chapters I Donors to charity gain in both indirect reciprocity and political 29 reputation II Reputation helps solve the 'tragedy of the commons' 37 III Volunteering leads to rock-paper-scissors dynamics in a public 47 goods game IV A human cooperation strategy that is conditional on being 59 recognized in other situations V Reputation is valuable inside and outside the own social group 69 Conclusion 81 Danksagung 83 References 85 Glossary 91 Appendix 93 Curriculum vitae 99 Erklärung 10",,info:eu-repo/semantics/doctoralThesis,,,Christian-Albrechts-Universität
Enhanced Mutualism Hypothesis,33899288,Understanding Mutualism When There is Adaptation to the Partner,,"de Mazancourt, C., Loreau, M., Dieckmann, U.",2005,"1. A mutualism is a mutually beneficial interaction between individuals of two species. Using the ongoing debate about plant-herbivore interactions as a springboard, we show that different measures of benefit arise depending on whether adaptation within the mutualism is considered.     2. A species' proximate response measures the short-term effect of addition or removal of the partner species, without allowing for any adaptation. We define a proximate mutualism as an interaction in which removal of each partner results in a decreased performance of the other, i.e., both species show a positive proximate response to the presence of the partner.     3. Almost all empirical studies use the proximate response criterion. However, a proximate mutualism might only reflect evolved dependence (implying that, through adaptation to the partner, a species has lost its ability to perform well without the partner). Therefore, some authors discard the proximate definition of mutualism, to prefer what we define as ultimate mutualism.     4. A species' ultimate response measures the long-term effect of adding or removing the partner species, thus allowing for the focal species to adapt to the absence or presence of its partner. We define an ultimate mutualism as an interaction in which each partner could never have performed as well without the other, even if it was adapted to the absence of the partner. In other words, a mutualism is called ultimate if both species show a positive ultimate response to the presence of the partner. Despite the conceptual attractiveness of this definition, ultimate responses are difficult to measure, rendering the notion of ultimate mutualism operationally problematic.     5. Using examples from the literature, we demonstrate the counterintuitive result that even obligate mutualisms are not necessarily ultimate mutualisms.     6. Finally, we define mutualistic evolution 1 as evolution of a trait that is costly to the bearer but beneficial to its partner in a proximate mutualism and show that, paradoxically, neither proximate nor ultimate mutualisms necessarily result in mutualistic evolution.     7. We conclude that the proximate response is the only criterion for mutualism that is operational in empirical research. A possible key mechanism that can generate a benefit in such mutualisms, evolved dependence, has to be further investigated empirically and seriously taken into account in theoretical studies, if our understanding of mutualism is to evolve.     8. More than a semantic case of hair splitting, our paper reveals a naive view of mutualism that needs revision. We need to recognise that in most if not all interactions now considered as mutualisms, measured benefits to at least one partner are likely to be partly or even completely the result of adaptation to the partner, leading to evolved dependence, rather than to what we would like to consider as real or ultimate benefits","Understanding Mutualism When  There is Adaptation to the Partner de Mazancourt, C., Loreau, M. and Dieckmann, U.

Using the ongoing debate about plant-herbivore interactions as a springboard, 3  we show that different measures of benefit arise depending on whether adaptation 4  within the mutualism is considered. 5  2- A species’ proximate response measures the short-term effect of addition or 6  removal of the partner species, without allowing for any adaptation. We define a 7  proximate mutualism as an interaction in which removal of each partner results in a 8  decreased performance of the other, i.e., both species show a positive proximate 9  response to the presence of the partner. 10  3- Almost all empirical studies use the proximate response criterion. However, a 11  proximate mutualism might only reflect evolved dependence (implying that, through  12  adaptation to the partner, a species has lost its ability to perform well without the 13  partner). Therefore, some authors discard the proximate definition of mutualism, to 14  prefer what we define as ultimate mutualism. 15  4- A species’ ultimate response measures the long-term effect of adding or 16  removing the partner species, thus allowing for the focal species to adapt to the 17  absence or presence of its partner. We define an ultimate mutualism as an interaction 18  in which each partner could never have performed as well without the other, even if it 19  was adapted to the absence of the partner. In other words, a mutualism is called 20  ultimate if both species show a positive ultimate response to the presence of the 21  partner. Despite the conceptual attractiveness of this definition, ultimate responses are 22  difficult to measure, rendering the notion of ultimate mutualism operationally 23  problematic. 24  5- Using examples from the literature, we demonstrate the counterintuitive result 25  that even obligate mutualisms are not necessarily ultimate mutualisms.  26  de Mazancourt, Loreau and Dieckmann           3    6- Finally, we define mutualistic evolution as evolution of a trait that is costly to 1  the bearer but beneficial to its partner in a proximate mutualism and show that,  2  paradoxically, neither proximate nor ultimate mutualisms necessarily result in  3  mutualistic evolution.  4  7- We conclude that the proximate response is the only criterion for mutualism that 5  is operational in empirical research. A possible key mechanism that can generate a 6  benefit in such mutualisms, evolved dependence, has to be further investigated 7  empirically and seriously taken into account in theoretical studies, if our  8  understanding of mutualism is to evolve.  9  8- More than a semantic case of hair splitting, our paper reveals a naive view of  10  mutualism that needs revision. We need to recognise that in most if not all 11  interactions now considered as mutualisms, measured benefits to at least one partner 12  are likely to be partly or even completely the result of adaptation to the partner, 13  leading to evolved dependence, rather than to what we would like to consider as 14  “real” or ultimate benefits.  15   16  Keywords: adaptation, coevolution, evolved dependence, mutualism,  17  overcompensation, plant-herbivore interaction, proximate response, ultimate 18  responseisms.  19  de Mazancourt, Loreau and Dieckmann                                                                                                  4   Introduction 1  Mutualisms are widespread in nature (Boucher et al., 1982; Bronstein, 1994b; 2  Menge, 2000; Richardson et al., 2000; Stachowicz, 2001). Although about a quarter of 3  ecological studies are devoted to mutualism (Bronstein, 1994b), our understanding of 4  and theoretical insights into this type of interaction are limited (Bronstein, 1994b). 5  One factor that might critically contribute to this gap is an ambiguity in the concept of 6  mutualism when there is, as is usual in a mutualistic interaction, adaptation to the 7  partner species. Here we focus on an interaction in a given environment and ask how 8  to determine whether or not it is mutualistic; of course, the same interaction might be 9  classified differently in a different environment (conditional mutualism; see Box 1 10  and Bronstein, 1994a). 11  We would like to start with a short example to set the scene for our argument. Jeon 12  (1972) witnessed the emergence of an obligate mutualism in the lab, evolving all the 13  way from parasitism. Amoeba discoides was infected with bacteria that initially 14  caused heavy mortality, small size, slow growth, and slow clone formation, and a high 15  sensitivity to adverse conditions. The amoeba and the bacteria coevolved, and after 5 16  years of infection, the adverse effects of the bacteria had disappeared. Moreover, after 17  this coevolution, neither the amoebae nor the bacteria would survive without the 18  other. This interaction is thus a clear example of a mutualism: since both organisms 19  need their partner to survive, they clearly derive a benefit from their partner’s 20  presence. However, is it possible that the amoeba would have been better off had the 21  bacteria never been there? Does the bacterium provide a “real” benefit to the amoeba? 22  Hence, should this interaction really be viewed as a mutualism? 23  In the following sections, we explain and define different criteria used to test for 24  mutualism: proximate response, ultimate response, and mutualistic evolution. We 25  de Mazancourt, Loreau and Dieckmann                                                                                                  5   show that there is a conflict between what is actually measured when testing for 1  mutualism, resulting in what we call proximate mutualism, and what many of us 2  would like a mutualism to mean, resulting in what we call ultimate mutualism. Each 3  criterion presented here has been used previously by a number of different authors – 4  yet these criteria have never been named, clearly defined, and properly contrasted. 5  Filling this lacuna provides the platform for a thought-provoking discussion about 6  what mutualism means. Several counterintuitive results will be demonstrated along 7  the way. 8  This study is motivated by a debate about plant-herbivore interactions. Some plants 9  have been shown to overcompensate, in the sense that their fitness was increased by 10  herbivore damage. The controversy in the literature that ensued from this observation 11  tried to clarify whether such a result implies that these plants actually benefit from 12  herbivory, so that the plant–herbivore interaction would have to be considered 13  mutualistic. After a general presentation of the ideas underlying this debate, we 14  discuss specific applications as well as their broader implication for other systems. 15  We suggest that effects like overcompensation should be taken as valid evidence that 16  herbivory benefits plants. However, the mechanism that is likely to generate this 17  benefit, evolved dependence, requires to be further investigated empirically and to be 18  seriously taken into account in empirical and theoretical studies, if our understanding 19  of mutualism is to evolve. 20  All key technical terms introduced in this study are defined in Box 1. 21    de Mazancourt, Loreau and Dieckmann                                                                                                  6   I. Theoretical basis 1  Proximate mutualism 2  Definition of proximate mutualism 3  One classical approach to test for mutualism experimentally is to evaluate the 4  performance of a species before and after its partner has been removed, or has been 5  kept at low density (Bender et al., 1984; Krebs, 1985; Schoener, 1983). This 6  comparison defines what we call the proximate response of a species to the removal 7  of its partner, and is the defining criterion for a proximate mutualism (Figure 1 and 8  Box 1). It is important to stress that, in this definition, the performance of the same 9  genotype (or group thereof) is compared with and without the partner species. The 10  proximate response might depend on the genotype considered, and, notably, on its 11  status of adaptation to the partner (Figure 1). 12  The proximate response criterion is used in most empirical studies of mutualisms. 13  Bronstein (1994b), reviewing the underlying experiments, described them as follows: 14  “mutualists were excluded or added… For example, many pollination studies 15  examined plant success after all but a single visitor species were excluded (Herrera, 16  1987)… Nearly all experimental studies of plant-ant protector mutualisms involved 17  excluding the ants in order to measure their benefit to the plant (Koptur & Lawton, 18  1988; Smiley, 1986).” Also mutualistic or parasitic effects of mycorrhizal associations 19  or of leaf endophytes have been assessed by comparing plant proximate response, i.e., 20  the performance of a plant genotype or population with and without these partners 21  (Faeth & Sullivan, 2003; Klironomos, 2003). 22  Proximate mutualism can result from evolved dependence 23  However, an observed decrease of performance when a focal species’ partner is 24  removed might result from the fact that the focal species was adapted to the presence 25  de Mazancourt, Loreau and Dieckmann                                                                                                  7   of its partner, and had thus compromised its ability to perform well in the partner’s 1  absence. In the context of endosymbioses, such an effect has been called evolved 2  dependence (Douglas & Smith, 1989). 3  It is important to emphasize that evolved dependence can occur independently of 4  whether or not an association is obligate; it is likely to happen in any type of 5  association where there is adaptation. Evolved dependence is in principle quantifiable 6  as the performance difference between the genotype that is adapted to the partner’s 7  absence and the genotype that is adapted to its presence, both measured in the absence 8  of the partner (Figure 1, Box 1). It comprises the cost of traits evolving as an 9  adaptation to the partner’s presence, as well as the “cost” of having lost some traits 10  that were adaptive in the absence of the partner (the latter cost appears in quotes 11  because it only is a cost when the partner is removed). Operationally, a very rough 12  indicator of the expected degree of mutual adaptation is the length of time that 13  partners have been in ecological contact with each other or, alternatively, the length of 14  time these partners have been separated. 15  In conclusion, the proximate response of a genotype is bound to depend on its 16  status of adaptation to the partner. A low performance when the partner is removed 17  can occur simply because the genotype is not adapted to this situation: its low 18  performance stems from evolved dependence. This is not the type of “real benefit” we 19  have in mind when assessing a mutualistic interaction. 20  Ultimate mutualism 21  Definition of ultimate mutualism 22  To understand whether evolved dependence is responsible for an observed 23  proximate mutualism between two species, or whether, instead, there is a “real 24  benefit” from the interaction, it is important to introduce a second criterion for 25  de Mazancourt, Loreau and Dieckmann                                                                                                  8    mutualism. Here we have to ask whether the focal species performs better than it 1  would ever have without the other species. We thus have to consider the ultimate 2  response of a species to its partner, measured by comparing the performance of two 3  different genotypes (or groups thereof): the performance of the one genotype adapted 4  to the partner, in the partner’s presence, is compared to the performance of the other 5  genotype adapted to the absence of the partner, in the partner’s absence. This 6  criterion, of course, is not without practical difficulties, which we will discuss in 7  detail below. The criterion leads to defining an ultimate mutualism as an interaction in 8  which each partner shows a positive ultimate response to the presence of the other 9  (Figure 1, Box 1). 10  The proximate response of a population adapted to its partner is equal to its 11  ultimate response plus evolved dependence. Therefore, if a population derives an 12  ultimate benefit from a partner species, it is also likely to derive a proximate benefit 13  from this interaction. However, the reverse is not true: a population adapted to the 14  partner that shows a proximate benefit from the interaction might derive no ultimate 15  benefit from the association whatsoever, if evolved dependence is the only cause of 16  the proximate benefit. 17  The existence of evolved dependence is one reason for discrepancies between 18  proximate and ultimate responses. Dependence of this sort is likely to be important 19  for partners with a long history of coevolution, and we must thus expect some such 20  interactions to be proximate but not ultimate mutualisms. 21  Accounting for ultimate responses in the literature 22  In studies of mutualism, a few authors adopted the ultimate response to measure 23  the benefit of an interaction. Examples from the plant-herbivore literature are 24  de Mazancourt, Loreau and Dieckmann    9 described below in the sections “Theoretical argument for plant’s ultimate benefit” 1  and “Measurement of plant’s ultimate responses”. 2  Another example of an author defining mutualism based on ultimate responses is 3  Roughgarden (1975) in a model for the evolution of a symbiosis between fish and 4  anemones. Assuming the ancestral state of fish to be free-living, Roughgarden 5  assessed the benefit of the symbiosis as the difference between the fitness of the free-6  living genotype and the fitness of the symbiotic genotype with an anemone. The 7  model assumes a strong evolved dependence in the system: when the symbiotic 8  genotype cannot find a host anemone, or when its host anemone dies, its reproductive 9  output is much reduced. 10  Measurement of ultimate responses 11  Measuring ultimate responses requires tests both on a genotype that is adapted to 12  the presence of the partner and on a genotype that is adapted to the absence of the 13  partner. Since there is no point in defining quantities that are not measurable in 14  practice, the status of adaptation to the partner must be assessed pragmatically. In 15  particular cases, it would be impossible to assess whether adaptation had reached an 16  evolutionary endpoint; these might not even exist (Dieckmann et al., 1995; 17  Gomulkiewicz et al., 2000; Thompson & Cunningham, 2002). However, this should 18  not prevent evaluation of an ultimate response based on the current status of 19  adaptation, which can be very roughly assessed based on the length of coevolutionary 20  history experienced by the partners. Note that in this context the strength of selection 21  imposed by a species on its partner is likely to be more important that the length of 22  their coevolutionary history, and would be a better proxy to the status of adaptation if 23  it could be quantified. For assessing ultimate responses, four cases can be 24  distinguished: 25  de Mazancourt, Loreau and Dieckmann    10 • We may have access to an ancestral state that is not adapted to the partner. 1  Performance measurements for the two genotypes under the appropriate 2  conditions can then be undertaken. 3  • The organism is fast evolving and viable without the partner, so that 4  experimental adaptation to the partner’s absence can be selected for on a 5  feasible timescale. Performance differences can then be measured as in the 6  first case. Unfortunately, the population experimentally adapted to the 7  partner’s absence might also inadvertently be subjected to other selective 8  pressures, besides those arising from the partner’s absence. 9  • Even though there may be no access to a suitable ancestral state, there may yet 10  exist separate populations of the focal organism with histories of evolution 11  with and without the partner. Measurements can then be carried out comparing 12  such populations, provided that sufficient replicates exist. This is not as 13  satisfactory a situation as in the preceding cases, because other factors are 14  likely to co-vary with the partner’s presence or absence. 15  • There may be no access to an ancestral state, the organism may not be viable 16  without the partner, or, even if it is viable, its generation time may be too long 17  for experimental adaptation to the partner’s absence to be feasible. Ultimate 18  responses then cannot be measured. However, if there is sufficient genetic 19  variation in the species, it may still be possible to search for genetic trade-offs 20  between the focal species’ performance with and without the partner to 21  establish indirect evidence for evolved dependence. 22  Douglas and Smith (1989) discuss in detail the difficulties of measuring ultimate 23  responses in endosymbioses. 24  de Mazancourt, Loreau and Dieckmann    11 To summarize, the concept of ultimate mutualism is very satisfactory conceptually, 1  but in many cases might prove unrealistic in terms of measurements. Unfortunately, 2  some authors seem to accept only this definition of mutualism and discard any 3  alternative based on proximate responses, thus apparently overlooking the difficulties 4  of measuring ultimate responses as well as the fact that most empirical work has only 5  measured proximate responses. 6  An obligate mutualism is not necessarily an ultimate mutualism 7  We would like to draw attention to the slightly counterintuitive fact that an obligate 8  mutualism is not necessarily an ultimate mutualism. We presented the case described 9  by Jeon (1972) in the introduction. Amoeba discoides was infected with a parasitic 10  bacterium. After adaptation took place, the adverse effects of the bacteria had 11  disappeared, suggesting a neutral ultimate response of the amoebae to the bacteria. 12  Moreover, both organisms had become dependent on the other for survival, resulting 13  in a mutualism that was both proximate and obligate. Importantly, however, the 14  proximate benefit derived by the amoeba from the interaction was probably due to 15  evolved dependence: the amoeba lost traits that made it adapted to the absence of the 16  bacteria, and there is no evidence for the interaction providing an ultimate benefit to 17  the amoeba. 18  Other examples involves Wolbachia, intracellular bacteria infecting a number of 19  invertebrates. In arthropods, these bacteria are rarely found to be beneficial to their 20  hosts and thus provide a striking example of selfish cytoplasmic elements. Despite 21  physiological costs or even virulence, they are able to maintain themselves through 22  induced modifications to host reproductive biology. Dedeine et al. (2001) report a 23  case of obligate mutualism with the parasitoid wasp Asobara tabida Nees 24  (Hymenoptera, Braconidae). Female wasps could not reproduce after removal of 25  de Mazancourt, Loreau and Dieckmann    12 Wolbachia because they could not produce mature oocytes. Dedeine et al. (2001) 1  suggest that the wasp or its ancestor became associated with a Wolbachia that already 2  produced a factor necessary for wasp oogenesis. The host then lost the capacity to 3  produce this costly factor itself, thus becoming totally dependent on the bacteria for 4  reproduction. Similar losses of function have been reported in other insect-Wolbachia 5  interactions. For example, there are several cases in which parthenogenesis induction 6  by Wolbachia infection can be reversed by curing the infection (Stouthamer, 1997), 7  but in some cases the host species can no longer function successfully as a sexual 8  taxon due to adverse changes in male and/or female traits (Arakaki et al., 2001; 9  Gottlieb & Zchori-Fein, 2001; Hunter, 1999). Gottlieb and Zchori-Fein (2001) argue 10  that since sexual reproduction has ceased, selection on sexual traits has been removed, 11  leading to the disappearance of or reduction in these traits. They suggest that in 12  symbionts that manipulate their host’s reproduction to induce parthenogenesis, the 13  host is being captured by the bacteria for the latter’s transmission benefit, leaving no 14  other way of reproduction for the host. These cases are clear examples of obligate 15  proximate mutualisms, where the main benefits for the host come from evolved 16  dependence. We suggest that these interactions are unlikely to be ultimate 17  mutualisms, but this has not yet been tested. 18  Even for interactions that went through a phase of ultimate mutualism it is 19  plausible that the interaction’s ultimate costs escalate over evolutionary time. Such a 20  development is especially likely for species that evolve an extreme dependence on 21  their partner, and therefore cannot get out of an interaction even if its costs escalate 22  (Pellmyr et al., 1997). As ultimate costs grow, the obligate interaction is likely to 23  cease to be an ultimate mutualism. For example, Johnson et al. (1997) argue that 24  plants that are highly dependent on mycorrhizae for nutrient uptake might have a 25  de Mazancourt, Loreau and Dieckmann    13 greater risk of mycorrhizal parasitism in highly fertilized systems, because they might 1  not closely control “unnecessary” root growth or rate of colonisation. It is possible 2  that a plant in an obligate mycorrhizal association might be “trapped” in this obligate 3  interaction even when conditions change and the interaction no longer implies any 4  ultimate benefit. 5  Questions resulting from comparing proximate and ultimate responses in mutualism 6  research 7  So far, in empirical studies, measured costs and benefits are almost exclusively 8  proximate (i.e., the same group of genotypes was compared with and without the 9  partner; Bronstein, 1994b). New and interesting research directions could thus be 10  opened up by investigating ultimate costs and benefits where possible, and by looking 11  for genetic trade-offs between genotypes differentially adapted to a partner’s absence 12  and presence. 13  A very important question in mutualism research is the evolution and maintenance 14  of mutualisms in the presence of cheaters (Bronstein, 2001; Denison et al., 2003; 15  Ferriere et al., 2002; Freckleton & Cote, 2003; Hoeksema & Kummel, 2003; 16  Johnstone & Bshary, 2002; Law et al., 2001; Yu, 2001). Measuring the costs induced 17  by the presence of cheaters is essential to tackle this question, and contrasting 18  proximate and ultimate costs might thus be a key element in advancing this line of 19  research. For example, nectar robbers damage floral parts and take resources without 20  effecting pollination (Inouye, 1980). Most removal experiments assess the cost of 21  robbers on the female fitness of the plant by experimentally removing robbers, thus 22  assessing the proximate cost of robbers’ presence. However, robbers also induce an 23  ultimate cost that is likely to be higher than the proximate cost. Roubik et al. (1985) 24  showed that the flowers of a tropical forest understory treelet, Quassia amara, had 25  de Mazancourt, Loreau and Dieckmann    14 lower corolla length and nectar production on an island where nectar robbers were 1  absent. This suggests that without robbers, there is selection against these traits, so 2  that the performance of plants adapted to robbers is suboptimal. Accordingly, evolved 3  dependence enlarges the ultimate cost of robbers’ presence relative to the 4  corresponding proximate cost. Measuring the evolved dependence for this system 5  would involve comparing the performances of different plant genotypes in the 6  presence and absence of robbers, in order to establish whether these plants show 7  variation in their adaptation to the presence of cheaters. 8  Evolution in a mutualism 9  We now examine a third dimension according to which mutualisms can be 10  assessed: the concept of mutualistic evolution is key to many discussions about 11  mutualism. We define mutualistic evolution as evolution of investment in the partner. 12  Such an adaptation has a direct cost to the bearer, but, other things being equal, 13  increases the performance of both partners. It is important to realize that not all 14  adaptations to a mutualistic partner qualify as mutualistic evolution. This is because 15  traits may also evolve to allow better exploitation of the partner or to prevent better 16  exploitation by the partner; in addition, certain functions may be lost evolutionarily if 17  they are provided more efficiently by the partner (Connor, 1995). 18  Where does the benefit of an interaction come from? 19  For defining proximate and ultimate mutualism above, we used criteria based on 20  the net effect of the presence of the partner (an effect-based definition; Abrams, 21  1987), rather than descriptions of the physiological and ecological processes through 22  which benefits are gained (a process-based definition; Abrams, 1987). For defining 23  mutualistic evolution it is interesting to distinguish between different categories of 24  benefit gained from an interaction. Connor (1995) classifies the benefits derived from 25  de Mazancourt, Loreau and Dieckmann    15 an interaction as (a) by-product benefits, occurring incidentally at no cost to the donor 1  (as for two plants accidentally growing together with one taking advantage of the 2  other’s protective thorns). Connor contrasts this with (b) purloined benefits, obtained 3  by exploiting the partner (as a predator would), and (c) invested benefits, obtained 4  despite a direct cost because the partner is giving something for a return. 5  Proximate and ultimate mutualisms can result from benefits of any of these types. 6  Several authors, however, have demanded evidence of evolution of invested benefits 7  as demonstration that an interaction is “truly” mutualistic (Belsky et al., 1993; 8  Agrawal, 2000). Below we argue that such evolution does not necessarily happen 9  either in a proximate or in an ultimate mutualism, and that it can occur even towards 10  an exploitative partner. We describe scenarios that would lead to such counterintuitive 11  results, by considering simple cases of two interacting species coevolving in a 12  constant environment. We note that since coevolution is often diffuse (Agrawal & 13  Van Zandt, 2003; Inouye & Stinchcombe, 2001), theory taking into account this 14  complexity needs to be developed (Loreau et al., 2003; Stanton, 2003) – but this 15  cannot be the purpose of our present study. 16  Antagonistic strategies can be selected for in mutualistic interactions 17  A mutualistic strategy might be counter-selected in a proximate or ultimate 18  mutualism. This is because investment in the partner is not selected for if the benefit 19  of the interaction has to be shared with too many conspecifics, illustrating the well-20  known fact that evolution of investment in the partner requires that “the partner must 21  reciprocate and that the reciprocated benefit must be captured by the initial giver or its 22  offspring” (Yu, 2001). Thus, a trait will not evolve if its beneficial effect is uniformly 23  distributed over all conspecifics. A case in point is the evolution of fruit abortion in 24  senita cacti or yuccas as a means of decreasing seed predation by their respective 25  de Mazancourt, Loreau and Dieckmann    16 pollinators: such adaptations will only occur if the pollinator population is localized 1  on the individual plant (Holland & DeAngelis, 2002). If the benefit of an investment 2  in the partner is distributed over conspecifics, there might even be selection for an 3  antagonistic strategy, as we show below in a plant-herbivore example. 4  Selection can favour investment into an exploiting partner 5  A possible scenario involves evolution of a trait that benefits the bearer by 6  protecting it against predation. For example, the majority of the estimated 6000 7  species of Lycaenids have associations with ants that range from mutualism to 8  parasitism (Pierce et al., 2002). A standard interpretation of the mutualistic 9  association is that lycaenid larvae produce secretions in order to attract ants and 10  benefit from their protection from parasitoids. However, another interpretation is 11  possible: Malicky (1970) has suggested that lycaenid larvae might produce secretions 12  in order to prevent predation by ants. These secretions would then be an example of 13  an investment into an exploiting partner. 14   15  II. Plant-herbivore interactions 16  Plant proximate response to herbivore removal 17  Experimental studies have demonstrated that, under some conditions, herbivory 18  leads to increased plant fitness. Lifetime reproductive output (seed production of 19  monocarpic plant species, controlling for seed weight and germination potential) was 20  increased by grazing or cutting for some populations of Ipomopsis aggregata 21  (Gronemeyer et al., 1997; Paige, 1992; Paige & Whitham, 1987) and Gentianella 22  campestris (Huhta et al., 2000b; Juenger et al., 2000; Lennartsson et al., 1997, 1998). 23  Other monocarpic species can show increased seed production following moderate 24  cutting under field conditions (Huhta et al., 2003) or artificial conditions such as 25  de Mazancourt, Loreau and Dieckmann    17 reduced competitive pressure and/or fertilizer application (Alward & Joern, 1993; 1  Benner, 1988; Huhta et al., 2000a). The results on Ipomopsis aggregata and 2  Gentianella campestris thus suggest that a proximate mutualism can exist between 3  these plants and their herbivores. 4  Some authors (Agrawal, 2000; Vail, 1994) accept this evidence as confirmation of 5  a possible benefit of the plant from herbivory, leading to the claim that plant-6  herbivore mutualism may exist. 7  Evolved dependence of plants towards their herbivores 8  Increased seed production in overcompensating plants results from the release of 9  apical dominance and from the production of numerous tillers (Benner, 1988; Huhta 10  et al., 2000b; Juenger et al., 2000; Lennartsson et al., 1997, 1998; Paige, 1999; Paige 11  & Whitham, 1987; Strauss & Agrawal, 1999). If the probability of herbivory is high, a 12  plant that produces multiple shoots from the beginning of the season will lose them all 13  to the herbivore (Crawley, 1987). If, however, herbivory only occurs during a short 14  period, damage by herbivores can serve as a signal for the plant that the risk of 15  herbivory soon will be over, and post-herbivory activation of dormant meristems is 16  selected for (Tuomi et al., 1994b; Vail, 1992). Several models suggest that plants 17  adapted to herbivory should have developed mechanisms for resource mobilization 18  triggered by herbivory (Jaremo et al., 1999; Lehtila, 2000; Mathews, 1994; Nilsson et 19  al., 1996a, 1996b; Simons & Johnston, 1999; Tuomi et al., 1994b; Vail, 1992, 1994). 20  This adaptation leads to low reproduction in the absence of herbivory, just because 21  this plant genotype is not adapted to a situation without herbivores, and there is a 22  trade-off between the ability of a plant to perform with and without herbivores. In the 23  presence of herbivores, it is advantageous to wait before allocating resources to 24  growth. In the absence of herbivores, however, this trait is disadvantageous and plants 25  de Mazancourt, Loreau and Dieckmann    18 should instead allocate all their resources to growth as soon as possible. Mechanisms 1  like this might explain the proximate benefit that these plants derive from herbivores. 2  Evolved dependence has likely arisen in many plant-herbivore interactions. In 3  Gentianella campestris, the plant’s ability to produce more seeds after herbivore 4  damage only occurs in populations adapted to either herbivory or mowing 5  (Lennartsson et al., 1997, 1998). Similarly, the ability to tolerate herbivory was 6  negatively correlated with fitness in the absence of herbivory in Ipomoea purpurea 7  (Tiffin & Rausher, 1999). 8  Because overcompensation is likely to result from evolved dependence rather than 9  any other mechanism of “real” benefit, some authors do not accept the proximate 10  response of overcompensation as sufficient proof that plants might benefit from 11  herbivory (Belsky et al., 1993; Järemo et al., 1999; Mathews, 1994; Tuomi et al., 12  1994b). 13  Ultimate mutualism in plant-herbivore interactions 14  Theoretical arguments for plant-herbivore interactions causing an ultimate cost to 15  plants 16  Vail (1992) built a model showing that plants benefit from herbivory because 17  plants adapted to herbivores should perform best with herbivores. However, he noted 18  that although removal of herbivores reduces fitness in the short term, “that would 19  simultaneously impart a selective pressure… and thus raise fitness in the long run.” 20  Mathews (1994) criticized Vail’s interpretation: “although Vail speculates about the 21  benefits of herbivory, his model in fact contradicts him because plant fitness is higher 22  in the absence of herbivory than anywhere else.” For Mathews, the proximate 23  criterion is not valid for testing benefits from herbivory: there needs to be an ultimate 24  benefit resulting from the presence of herbivores. Also in other recent studies there 25  de Mazancourt, Loreau and Dieckmann                                                                                                   19   seems to be some convergence towards using the ultimate response criterion (Järemo 1  et al., 1999; Nilsson et al., 1996a, 1996b; Simons & Johnston, 1999; Stowe et al., 2  2000; Tuomi et al., 1994a, 1994b), and rejecting the validity of a proximal response 3  criterion. 4  No empirical evidence for plant-herbivore interactions causing an ultimate benefit for 5  plants 6  Järemo et al. (1999) measured the ultimate response of Gentianella campestris to 7  herbivore removal. Based on existing data, they compared populations that have 8  evolved with the herbivore to populations that have evolved without it. They found no 9  empirical evidence for an ultimate benefit for the plant, but there was also no evidence 10  for an ultimate cost. 11  In a different study, the comparison of reaction norms of maternal lines of 12  Gentianella campestris from different populations also failed to show any trade-off 13  between fitness in the absence of herbivory and the ability to compensate for 14  herbivory (Juenger et al., 2000). To conclude, this plant seems to show no strong 15  ultimate response to herbivores: herbivores seem ultimately neutral. 16  Mutualistic evolution in plant-herbivore interactions 17  Belsky et al. (1993) define a “mutualistic plant” as a plant that “makes some 18  portion of their bodies available to herbivores” (i.e., a plant that invests in the 19  herbivore), whereas an “antagonistic plant” defends itself against herbivores. They 20  argue that if the plant-herbivore interaction was a mutualism, then we should witness 21  the evolution of mutualistic plants, implying mutualistic evolution through which a 22  plant evolves to invest in its herbivore. However, here we argue that this is not 23  necessarily the case. 24  de Mazancourt, Loreau and Dieckmann    20 If herbivores have a positive effect on plant fitness through the efficient recycling 1  of nutrients (de Mazancourt et al., 2001), then plants receive a benefit from the 2  presence of herbivores. The more efficient the herbivore is at recycling nutrients, the 3  more benefit there is to the plant, and at high herbivore recycling efficiencies the 4  interaction can well be a proximate or even an ultimate mutualism. However, when 5  nutrient cycling is redistributed amongst all plants, mutualistic plants experience a 6  direct cost and exert a positive effect on the herbivore. They do not receive a one-on-7  one benefit, as all plants receive a benefit through the herbivore. It can be shown that 8  the more efficient the herbivore becomes at recycling nutrients, the more selection 9  favours defended plants, because they benefit more from nutrients recycled from less 10  defended plants. Therefore, the more herbivores recycle, the more antagonistic plant 11  strategies are selected for and plant defences thus go up. At the same time, 12  nevertheless, the interaction can become a proximate and even an ultimate mutualism, 13  as long as herbivores conserve nutrients in the system to and extent that enables plants 14  to perform better on the whole. 15  Although there have been many empirical studies on the effects of herbivores on 16  nutrient cycling (Carpenter & Kitchell, 1984; Chaneton et al., 1996; Detling, 1988; 17  Floate, 1981; Jarvis et al., 1989; Pastor & Cohen, 1997; Ritchie et al., 1998; Ruess et 18  al., 1989; Ruess & McNaughton, 1988; Seagle et al., 1992; Wilson & Jefferies, 1996), 19  none has yet studied the net effect of herbivory on plant fitness and the resultant 20  selection pressure on plants. Therefore there exists no empirical indication to date that 21  would allow us to assess how widely the scenario sketched here occurs in nature. 22    de Mazancourt, Loreau and Dieckmann    21 Conclusions 1  So, what is a mutualism when there is adaptation to the partner? In this paper we 2  have defined and systematically contrasted three alternative definitions of mutualism. 3  If we need to choose only one of them, it has to be that of proximate mutualism. If we 4  were to discard the criterion of proximate mutualism, we would abandon core 5  evidence for most studied examples of mutualism. However, in choosing this 6  criterion, we must acknowledge the potential importance of evolved dependence as a 7  valid mechanism that creates a benefit resulting from the partner’s presence. In the 8  plant-herbivore debate, this means that we have to accept evidence of 9  overcompensation as evidence that plants indeed benefit from herbivory (provided 10  that overcompensation occurs as a result of a realistic herbivory event), however 11  irritating and counterintuitive this might be. More empirical and theoretical studies 12  should take into account evolved dependence as a possibly crucial mechanism 13  generating mutualism. 14  Ultimate mutualism is similar to what many people would intuitively like to call 15  mutualism, or “true” mutualism (as stated by Agrawal 2000; i.e., a mutualism that 16  does not stem from evolved dependence). Unfortunately, the ultimate response is not 17  even meaningful in many classical examples of mutualism. Also because of major 18  difficulties involved in its measurement, we believe that the ultimate response will 19  remain an abstraction that is not always useful. Moreover, even obligate mutualisms 20  are not guaranteed to be “true” or ultimate mutualisms. 21  The plant-herbivore controversy seemed resolved by adopting a criterion of 22  ultimate rather than proximate benefit (Järemo et al., 1999), thus rejecting the 23  proximate criterion of overcompensation. We contend that this is not satisfactory, as 24  the proximate criterion cannot be rejected without serious reconsideration of most 25  de Mazancourt, Loreau and Dieckmann    22 classical examples of mutualism. Instead, we argue, we ought to recognise the 1  potentially very important role of evolved dependence in all mutualisms. 2  Finally, the analysis of adaptations that can bring about, maintain, or jeopardize 3  mutualistic interactions needs to be disentangled from the criteria for mutualism itself. 4  As we have shown, traits that favour or harm a partner might evolve in any type of 5  interaction: hence, defining mutualism through mutualistic evolution seems of limited 6  utility. 7  Differentiating between the three concepts introduced here allows us to focus on 8  new and stimulating research questions. For many interactions that are considered 9  mutualistic it will be illuminating to evaluate empirically (a) whether there is 10  adaptation to the presence of the partner, (b) through which route evolved dependence 11  has been selected for, (c) how evolved dependence contributes to proximate benefits, 12  and (d) how proximate and ultimate benefits affect the mutualistic or antagonistic 13  evolution of traits. 14   15  Acknowledgements 16  We thank Tim Barraclough, Martin Bidartondo, Judie Bronstein, Austin Burt, 17  James Cook, Angela Douglas, Jaboury Ghazoul, David Gibson, Matt Goddard, 18  Edward Allen Herre, Jason Hoeksema, Mark Rees, Mark Schwartz, Juha Tuomi, 19  Stephen Vail, Andrew Wilby, Doug Yu, and several anonymous reviewers for useful 20  discussions and comments on previous versions of this manuscript.

Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 24  72, 529-546. 25  de Mazancourt, Loreau and Dieckmann    33 Box 1: Definition of key terms 1  Performance: To compare the performance of organisms under different conditions 2  (with or without partners), an absolute measure of performance is required, rather than 3  a relative one. What measure to use is not a trivial question. Possible performance 4  measures include the following. (1) Absolute fitness of an individual, i.e., its lifetime 5  reproductive success, always equals 1 when populations are at steady state, so that 6  care must be taken in setting the conditions under which lifetime reproductive success 7  is measured (as described below). Proxies of absolute fitness can sometime be used. 8  (2) Short-term population growth rate is a good proxy of lifetime reproductive 9  success under conditions of repeated disturbance, through which a population mostly 10  remains in an exponential growth phase. (3) Long-term population size may be a 11  proxy of absolute fitness for populations close to steady state. Discrepancies between 12  the different measures are discussed in Abrams (1987) and van Baalen and Jansen 13  (2001). 14  Proximate response: Difference in performance of a genotype (or group thereof) 15  before and after short-term removal (or addition) of the partner species. Note that the 16  performance of the same genotype (or group thereof) is thus compared under two 17  conditions, one of which it might not be adapted to. Measurement – If performance is 18  measured as lifetime reproductive success, the focal species’ density after removal 19  must be kept at its value before removal. We can then consider the focal population 20  with its partner, with LRS = 1, remove the partner, and measure the new lifetime 21  reproductive success, LRSP. The proximate response to removal is LRSP – 1. 22  Proximate mutualism: Interspecific interaction in which removal of each partner 23  results in a decreased performance of the other. It is characterised by negative 24  proximate responses of each species to the removal of the other species. Such 25  de Mazancourt, Loreau and Dieckmann    34 negative proximate responses can be due to “real” or ultimate benefits, but 1  alternatively may merely reflect evolved dependence resulting from adaptation to 2  partner. 3  Evolved dependence: Through adaptation to the presence of an interacting partner 4  species, a population might lose its ability to perform well in the absence of such a 5  partner. Evolved dependence measures the loss of performance of a focal population 6  in the absence of a partner due to its adaptation to the presence of the partner. 7  Measurement – If performance is measured as lifetime reproductive success, we can 8  consider the focal population with its partner, remove the partner, and measure the 9  new lifetime reproductive success, LRSP. We can then replace every individual in the 10  focal population with a genotype adapted to the absence of the partner, and measure 11  the new lifetime reproductive success, LRSU. The evolved dependence is LRSU – 12  LRSP. 13  Ultimate response: Difference in performance before and after “long-term” removal 14  (or addition) of a partner species, allowing for adaptation to take place. Performance 15  of a genotype (or group thereof) adapted to the presence of the partner is measured in 16  the presence of the partner, and compared to the performance of a genotype (or group 17  thereof) adapted to the absence of the partner measured in the absence of the partner. 18  Measurement – If performance is measured as lifetime reproductive success, the focal 19  species’ density in the presence and absence of its partner must be kept the same. We 20  can then consider the focal population with its partner, with LRS = 1; remove the 21  partner and replace every individual in the focal population with a genotype adapted 22  to the absence of the partner, and measure the new lifetime reproductive success, 23  LRSU. The ultimate response to removal is LRSU – 1. 24  de Mazancourt, Loreau and Dieckmann    35 Ultimate mutualism: Interspecific interaction in which each partner species could 1  never have performed as well without the other, even if it was adapted to the absence 2  of the partner. In other words, an ultimate mutulaism is characterised by negative 3  ultimate responses of each species to the removal of the other species. 4  Mutualistic evolution: Evolution of a trait that is costly to the bearer but beneficial to 5  its partner in a proximate mutualism (investment in a partner sensu Connor, 1995). 6  Note that adaptation to the partner does not necessarily imply mutualistic evolution; 7  for example, there can be evolution of traits that allow to better exploit the partner. 8  Obligate mutualism: Interaction in which the removal of the partner results in death 9  or complete loss of reproduction in the focal species. The focal species has therefore a 10  proximate benefit from the interaction, as its proximate response to partner removal is 11  maximally negative. In many cases, the ultimate response to partner removal cannot 12  be measured in obligate mutualisms. (Antonym: facultative mutualism). 13  Conditional mutualism: Interspecific interaction that is mutualistic (proximately or 14  ultimately) only under specific environmental conditions (Bronstein, 1994a). 15  de Mazancourt, Loreau and Dieckmann    36 Figure 1.  Performance of a genotype adapted to the absence of its partner (left 1  column), a genotype adapted to the presence of its partner (right column), both in the 2  presence of the partner (upper row), and in the absence of its partner (lower row). 3  Differences between these four performances measure the responses discussed in the 4  text. The proximate response of the organism to partner removal is measured for 5  individual genotypes, as FGa/p – FGa/a for the genotype adapted to the partner, and as 6  FGp/p – FGp/a for the genotype adapted to the absence of the partner. The ultimate 7  response of the organism to partner removal is measured as FGp/p – FGa/a, i.e., as the 8  difference between the performance in the presence of the partner of a genotype that 9  evolved with the partner and the performance in the absence of the partner of a 10  genotype that evolved without the partner. Evolved dependence is measured as the 11  difference between the performance without the partner of a genotype that evolved 12  without the partner and the performance without the partner of a genotype that 13  evolved with the partner, FGa/a – FGp/a. Note that the ultimate response of a genotype 14  adapted to the partner equals its proximate response minus the evolved dependence. 15    de Mazancourt, Loreau and Dieckmann    37   Partner present Partner absent Genotype Ga, adapted to absence of partner: Genotype Gp, adapted to presence of partner: FGa/a FGa/p FGp/p FGp/a Evolved dependence Proximate response Proximate response Ult ima te r esp ons e         Figure 1 de Mazancourt, Loreau and Dieckmann   ","Monograph, NonPeerReviewed",,,IR-05-016

In the model, interactions are anonymous, the population is well-mixed, and the evolutionary process selects strategies according to material payoffs. The cooperation problem is modelled as a game similar to Prisoner’s Dilemma, but there is an outside option of nonparticipation and the payoff to mutual cooperation is stochastic; with positive probability, this payoff exceeds that from cheating against a cooperator. Under mild conditions, mutually beneficial cooperation occurs in equilibrium. This is possible because the non-participation option holds down the equilibrium frequency of cheating",,info:eu-repo/semantics/other,"Cooperation, voluntary participation, random payoffs.",,

Because mutualisms can bind species to a common fate, mutualism breakdown has the potential to expand and accelerate effects of global change on biodiversity loss and ecosystem disruption. The current focus on the ecological dynamics of mutualism under global change has skirted fundamental evolutionary issues. Here, we develop an evolutionary perspective on mutualism breakdown to complement the ecological perspective, by focusing on three processes: (1) shifts from mutualism to antagonism, (2) switches to novel partners and (3) mutualism abandonment. We then identify the evolutionary factors that may make particular classes of mutualisms especially susceptible or resistant to breakdown and discuss how communities harbouring mutualisms may be affected by these evolutionary responses. We propose a template for evolutionary research on mutualism resilience and identify conservation approaches that may help conserve targeted mutualisms in the face of environmental change. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS",,info:eu-repo/semantics/article,,,

However, what makes this mechanism so powerful also has an evolutionary downside. Reciprocal cooperation faces a chicken-and-egg problem of the same kind as communication: it requires two functions to evolve at the same time—cooperation and response to cooperation. As a result, it can only emerge if one side first evolves for another reason, and is then recycled into a reciprocal function. Developing an evolutionary model in which we make use of machine learning techniques, we show that this occurs if the fact to cooperate and reward others’ cooperation become general abilities that extend beyond the set of contexts for which they have initially been selected. Drawing on an evolutionary analogy with the concept of generalization, we identify the conditions necessary for this to happen. This allows us to understand the peculiar distribution of reciprocal cooperation in the wild, virtually absent in most species—or limited to situations where individuals have partially overlapping interests, but pervasive in the human species",,info:eu-repo/semantics/article,,,'The Royal Society'

Theories of cooperation are based on kin selection (dependent on genetic relatedness) group selection and reciprocal altruism. The idea of reciprocal altruism usually involves direct reciprocity: repeated encounters between the same individuals allow for the return of an altruistic act by the recipient. Here we present a new theoretical framework, which is based on indirect reciprocity and does not require the same two individuals ever to meet again. Individual selection can nevertheless favour cooperative strategies directed towards recipients that have helped others in the past. Cooperation pays because it confers the image of a valuable community member to the cooperating individual. We present computer simulations and analytic models that specify the conditions required for evolutionary stability of indirect reciprocity. We show that the probability of knowing the 'image' of the recipient must exceed the cost-to-benefit ratio of the altruistic act.

I propose a simpler view of the relationship between habitat distribution and species richness, the ‘habitat amount hypothesis’, and I suggest ways of testing it. The habitat amount hypothesis posits that, for habitat patches in a matrix of non-habitat, the patch size effect and the patch isolation effect are driven mainly by a single underly-ing process, the sample area effect. The hypothesis predicts that species richness in equal-sized sample sites should increase with the total amount of habitat in the ‘local landscape ’ of the sample site, where the local landscape is the area within an appropriate distance of the sample site. It also predicts that species richness in a sample site is independent of the area of the particular patch in which the sample site is located (its ‘local patch’), except insofar as the area of that patch contributes to the amount of habitat in the local landscape of th",,text,"habitat fragmentation, habitat loss, l",,

A recent hypothesis advanced by Fahrig (2013) would, if supported, greatly diminish the relevance of habitat configuration as a predictor of diversity. The Habitat Amount Hypothesis posits that the sample area effect overrides patch size and patch isolation effects of habitat fragmentation on species richness. It predicts that the amount of habitat in a local landscape, regardless of configuration, is the main landscape-level determinant of species richness. If habitat amount is indeed the major, landscape-level driver of species richness, the slopes of the species–area relationship (SAR) for otherwise similar fragmented and unfragmented landscapes should be indistinguishable. We tested the Habitat Amount Hypothesis with data from two replicated and controlled habitat fragmentation experiments that disentangle the effects of habitat amount and configuration. One experiment provided time-series data on plant species richness and the other on micro-arthropod species richness. We found that, relative to less fragmented habitats, the SARs for fragmented habitats have significantly higher slopes and that the magnitude of the difference in slopes increased over time. Relatively more species were lost in smaller areas when fragments were more isolated. In both experiments, the proportion of species lost due to increased habitat fragmentation was nearly identical to the proportion lost due to reduced habitat amount. Our results provide a direct and experimentally derived refutation of the Habitat Amount Hypothesis, supporting the long-held view that in addition to area, patch isolation and configuration are important determinants of species richness. Differences in species richness between fragmented and non-fragmented habitats increase over time, demonstrating that long-term studies are needed to understand the effects of fragmentation, above and beyond the amount of habitat lost",,"Life sciences, medicine and health care","Life sciences, medicine and health care",,

habitat amount hypothesis,233211605,Habitat Size Mediates the Effects of Environmental Factors on Species Richness,,"Schuler, Matthew Scott",2015,"The Species Area Relationship (SAR) is one of the oldest and most fundamental patterns in ecology. Researchers have long known that a larger habitat will support more species than a smaller habitat. In the early 20th century, a predictive mathematical model was developed giving researchers an opportunity to understand the consequences of habitat loss for patterns of species richness and diversity. Species richness refers to the number of species observed within a given area. Related to species richness, species diversity is any statistical metric that allows researchers to compare species richness values measured across habitats that have varying probabilities of sampling individuals of the species present. Researchers have used the SAR model to understand the number of species that could be supported by a given amount of habitat, but have also used the SAR to compare the number of species supported by different habitats, to into infer important environmental factors that lead to differences in species richness among habitats. Ecologists have given great attention to studying the roles that these environmental factors play in determining how many species a given habitat will support. Yet, very little consideration has been given to the way in which habitat size alters the effects of those environmental factors on species richness patterns. This dissertation explores the influences that habitat size has on environmental factors that have been proposed as mechanisms that increase or maintain species richness in local habitats. I present three chapters each describing the findings of experiments that explored the interplay between habitat size and three commonly invoked mechanisms that affect local species richness: energy, species dispersal, and habitat heterogeneity. In Chapter 1, I present an experimental test of the species-energy-area relationship, where energy and area are predicted to interact in a positive way to increase the total number of species in a habitat. While much attention has been given to the interaction between habitat size and energy, researchers have failed to recognize that energy input may not be directly acting as a mechanism increasing species richness, but instead increasing the density of individuals, which increases the likelihood of detecting species in high-energy habitats. The 2nd chapter addresses the way in which habitat area alters the importance of dispersal for maintaining species richness in habitats, where small habitats are predicted to benefit more from dispersal than large habitats. Despite classical models in ecology predicting that species dispersal should be most important in small habitats, no conclusive experimental evidence exists showing that habitat size alters the importance of dispersal on species richness in local communities. Finally, in the 3rd chapter I present data from an experiment showing how the importance of habitat heterogeneity depends on habitat size and the aggregation of species among habitats. Habitat heterogeneity has been implicated as one of the most important mechanisms required to increase and maintain species richness in local communities. However, a meta-analysis of heterogeneity experiments revealed that experimental evidence is inconclusive, because many researchers have found positive and negative relationships between habitat heterogeneity and species richness. Additionally, the Area-Heterogeneity-Trade-Off (AHTO) model, developed to predict the relationship between habitat heterogeneity and species richness, has proven to be difficult to test in natural environments, due to the correlation of alternative environmental parameters with habitat heterogeneity. The results of this experiment support the main predictions of the AHTO, but show that the patterns predicted by the model can arise from alternative mechanisms than what the model predicts. The results from the experiments presented within this dissertation advance ecologists\u27 understanding of how environmental variables that are thought to drive patterns of species richness are mediated by the size of the habitat being studied. Furthermore, the results of these experiments add to a longstanding debate in ecology over the importance of habitat size in maintaining species richness. According to the SAR model, the reduction in size of a contiguous habitat will result in an immediate reduction in species richness. Some researchers have suggested, however, that the SAR model always under-predicts the loss of species richness as habitat size decreases. The research presented in this dissertation supports the conclusion that as habitat size decreases, species will be lost at a rate different from the prediction of the SAR model, due to the complex and non-linear relationships between habitat size and environmental factors like energy and heterogeneity that affect the number of species a local habitat could support",,text,"Aquatic Ecology, Community Ecology, Diversity, Biology",,Washington University Open Scholarship

Habitat structure may be conceived as being hierarchical, where larger, more diverse, portions or categories contain smaller, more homogeneous portions. When this conceptualization is combined with the observation that species have different abilities to  relate to portions of the habitat that differ in their characteristics, a number of known patterns can be derived and new patterns hypothesized. We propose a quantitative form of this habitat-species relationship by considering species abundance to be a function of habitat specialization, habitat fragmentation, amount of habitat, and adult body mass. The model reproduces and explains patterns such as variation in rank-abundance curves, greater variation and extinction probabilities of habitat specialists, discontinuities in traits (abundance, ecological range, pattern of variation, body size) among species sharing a community or area, and triangular distribution of body sizes, among others. The model has affinities to Holling's textural discontinuity hypothesis and metacommunity theory but  differs from both by offering a more general perspective.

(Nathan D.), Fahrig, L. (Lenore)",2016,"Context: Landscape structure shapes the genetic structure of populations by delimiting spatial patterns of dispersal and reproduction across generations. Thus, descriptions of human-altered landscapes can be used to predict demographic and evolutionary outcomes of populations. Effectively measuring landscape structure to predict genetic structure requires that we understand the relative importance of distinct components of landscape structure (e.g., habitat amount and configuration) in creating spatial patterns of genetic variation. Objectives: We thus developed an individual-based simulation model to test predictions about the relative importance of habitat amount and configuration in producing genetic structure. We also investigated the independent relationships between components of landscape structure and the population dynamics that underlie genetic effects. Methods: We ran experiments in which we allowed gene flow and population size to vary as emergent outcomes of the interactions between hypothetical populations and heterogeneous landscapes. Results: We found that the amount of habitat in a landscape is a much better predictor of genetic structure than is habitat configuration. This pattern holds across a range of landscapes and dispersal distances and behaviors. When habitat is non-contiguous (i.e., fragmented), habitat amount mediates production of genetic differentiation by regulating both the size and isolation of habitat patches, which in turn regulate population size and gene flow. Conclusions: These results suggest that habitat amount, a simple measure that is easy to calculate, may often be the best metric for predicting population genetic structure and that when possible, measures of habitat amount and population size should be incorporated into landscape genetic studies",,info:eu-repo/semantics/article,"Connectivity, Conservation genetics, Habitat fragmentation, Habitat loss, Individual-based model, Landscape metric",,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC'

Distinguishing between these theories is essential for effective conservation planning in modified landscapes.Objective:Identify which factors of habitat type, amount and configuration predict the persistence of a keystone woodland specialist, the eastern bettong Bettongia gaimardi, in a fragmented landscape.Method:In the Midlands region of Tasmania we carried out camera surveys at 62 sites in summer and winter. We included habitat and landscape features to model whether habitat amount or patch size and isolation influenced the presence of the eastern bettong, and to measure effects of habitat quality.Results:Habitat amount within a 1 km buffer was a better predictor of occupancy than patch size and isolation. Occupancy was also affected by habitat quality, indicated by density of regenerating stems.Conclusion:Our results support the habitat amount hypothesis as a better predictor of presence.

The ‘passive sampling’ model states that the regional abundance of species randomly determines their occurrence in patches. The ‘habitat amount hypothesis’ also challenges patch size and isolation effects, arguing that they occur because of a 'sample area effect'. Here we (1) ask whether the structure of the mammal assemblages of fluvial islands shows a nested pattern, (2) test whether species’ regional abundance predicts species’ occurrence on islands, and (3) ask whether habitat amount in the landscape and matrix resistance to biological flow predict the islands’ species composition. We quantified nestedness and tested its significance using null models. We used a regression model to analyze whether a species’ relative regional abundance predicts its incidence on islands. We accessed islands’ species composition by an NMDS ordination and used multiple regression to evaluate how species composition responds to habitat amount and matrix resistance. The degree of nestedness did not differ from that expected by the passive sampling hypothesis. Likewise, species’ regional abundance predicted its occurrence on islands. Habitat amount successfully predicted the species composition on islands, whereas matrix resistance did not. We suggest the application of habitat amount hypothesis for predicting species composition in other patchy systems. Although the island biogeography perspective has dominated the literature, we suggest that the passive sampling perspective is more appropriate for explaining the assemblages’ structure in this and other non-equilibrium patch systems",,"Life sciences, medicine and health care","Life sciences, medicine and health care",,
habitat amount hypothesis,56139550,Quantifying the effect of habitat availability on species distributions,,"Aarts, G.M., Fieberg, J., Brasseur, S.M.J.M., Matthiopoulos, J.",2013,"1.If animals moved randomly in space, the use of different habitats would be proportional to their availability. Hence, deviations from proportionality between use and availability are considered the tell-tale sign of preference. This principle forms the basis for most habitat selection and species distribution models fitted to use-availability or count data (e.g. MaxEnt and Resource Selection Functions). 2.Yet, once an essential habitat type is sufficiently abundant to meet an individual's needs, increased availability of this habitat type may lead to a decrease in the use/availability ratio. Accordingly, habitat selection functions may estimate negative coefficients when habitats are superabundant, incorrectly suggesting an apparent avoidance. Furthermore, not accounting for the effects of availability on habitat use may lead to poor predictions, particularly when applied to habitats that differ considerably from those for which data have been collected. 3.Using simulations, we show that habitat use varies non-linearly with habitat availability, even when individuals follow simple movement rules to acquire food and avoid risk. The results show that the impact of availability strongly depends on the type of habitat (e.g. whether it is essential or substitutable) and how it interacts with the distribution and availability of other habitats. 4.We demonstrate the utility of a variety of existing and new methods that enable the influence of habitat availability to be explicitly estimated. Models that allow for non-linear effects (using b-spline smoothers) and interactions between environmental covariates defining habitats and measures of their availability were best able to capture simulated patterns of habitat use across a range of environments. 5.An appealing aspect of some of the methods we discuss is that the relative influence of availability is not defined a priori, but directly estimated by the model.

For many animals, occupancy and density may be determined by distinct ecological processes. Here we develop a novel abundance model as the product of landscape-scale occupancy probability and habitat-scale density given occupancy. One can conceptualize our model as fully packing a landscape with home ranges or territories based on habitat quality, and then subtracting territories based on a probabilistic process that accounts for the fact that species rarely exhibit full occupancy across heterogeneous landscapes. The model is designed to predict abundance at fine spatial scales, using resolutions equal to or smaller than a single home range or territory. We demonstrate this model on the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), a species of management concern linked to post-fire forests. Occupancy is derived from a regional monitoring effort, while density given occupancy comes from a telemetry study of variation in territory size. A Bayesian framework is used to combine independent occupancy and home-range size models and predict abundance of Black-backed Woodpeckers at 4 fires that burned in 2012 or 2013. Predictions are evaluated with independently collected survey data, showing that the model is successful at predicting both absolute abundance at fires as well as relative abundance within and among fires. The conceptual model presents a promising new framework for fine-scale modeling of density and abundance for other territorial yet elusive species. Telemetry and occupancy data are widely collected for many species, but rarely utilized in combination, and the ecological exploration of the factors that determine occurrence versus home-range size may provide useful biological insight. As applied to the Black-backed Woodpecker, the model provides a tool for resource managers to explore trade-offs in retaining burned forest habitat versus managing for other post-fire goals, such as salvage logging or reforestation efforts that require snag removal",,Article,"Density, population size, wildlife habitat model, Bayesian, home range, Black- backed Woodpecker",,

habitat amount hypothesis,429665225,Habitat predictors of a vertebrate community in a fragmented neotropical landscape,,"Seetharaman, Keerthikrutha",2021,"Habitat is an area that allows a species to survive and thrive. Habitat loss and habitat modification are considered two major threats to species persistence. Habitat predictors are environmental conditions which dictate patterns in species occupancy and thereby community distribution. Understanding habitat predictors at multiple spatial scales can aid managers in directing conservation measures, predicting effects of habitat modification and advancing theoretical knowledge about the effects of habitat fragmentation. Habitat predictors of ground-dwelling Neotropical vertebrates at multiple spatial scales, especially landscape scales, are often poorly known. To fill this knowledge gap, I conducted a study in a fragmented forest landscape in Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica. In the 1960s, continuous tropical wet forests in my study area were burnt to clear land for cattle ranching. This process modified swathes of wet forests into smaller fragments surrounded by human-use areas. I chose 19 forests in this landscape situated in and around the Área de Conservacíon Guanacaste (ACG), a UNESCO World Heritage Site, documented vertebrates using camera traps and calculated habitat variables at the three spatial scales of camera trap point, forest and landscape using field measurements and remote sensing imagery. We documented 32 species of ground-dwelling vertebrates and calculated 13 aspects of the vertebrate community as response variables. We tested the ability of 12 habitat variables to explain variation in the community response variables using linear mixed effect modelling in an AIC-based model averaging framework. Our results show that different scales of habitat affect different aspects of the vertebrate community, highlighting a need for examination of multi-scale habitat variables. Habitat predictors at landscape scales were important to the widest range of vertebrate response variables. Our key results highlight that threatened species associated with areas of continuous forests and species richness were highest in forests surrounded by plantation matrix as opposed to pasture. Detections of species at higher trophic levels (e.g. large carnivores) increased with the amount of forested area within 2km of camera traps. Our study thus highlights the need to examine various aspects of a vertebrate community, not just species richness, in order to understand in-depth, the effects of habitat change.Science, Faculty ofZoology, Department ofGraduat",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/Text, Thesis/Dissertation",,,University of British Columbia

We found that total predator biomass scaled with habitat size and prey resources as expected across 29 New Zealand rivers, such that a unit of habitat in a small ecosystem supported less predator biomass than an equivalent unit in a large ecosystem. The lower energetic costs of large body size likely mean that a unit of prey resource supports more biomass of large-bodied predators compared to small-bodied predators.

(Lenore)",2001,"If conservation efforts are to be successful, it is critical that we understand the relationship between habitat loss and the probability of population extinction. Available evidence suggests a threshold amount of habitat loss at which the probability of population extinction increases from near-zero to near-one following a small additional loss of habitat. The main factors thought to determine this extinction threshold are reproductive rate of the organism, rate of emigration of the organism from habitat, habitat pattern in the landscape (fragmentation), and matrix quality (survival rate of the organism in non-habitat areas). Effective conservation measures require knowledge not only of what factors determine the threshold, but also the relative magnitudes of their effects. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the relative effects of these four factors on the extinction threshold, using a spatially-explicit simulation model. Reproductive rate had the largest potential effect on the extinction threshold. The rate of emigration from habitat also had a very strong predicted effect on the extinction threshold; the higher the rate of emigration, the more habitat was needed for persistence. Matrix quality had a moderate effect, and habitat pattern had a very small predicted effect. The simulations predicted that under certain circumstances up to 58% less habitat is required for population persistence, if a matrix of very low quality is converted to a matrix of very high quality. Matrix quality can be improved by maintaining heterogeneous landscapes with a diversity of vegetated features, and by reducing factors causing direct mortality of dispersers such as road traffic and pesticides. In summary, the simulations suggest that (i) the first priority for conservation should be habitat preservation and restoration, (ii) information on movement rates of organisms is critical for predicting extinction thresholds and (iii) conservation strategies should consider the quality of the whole landscape, including the matrix",,info:eu-repo/semantics/article,"Dispersal mortality, Emigration, Extinction threshold, Habitat fragmentation, Habitat loss, Landscape structure, Matrix quality, Population persistence, Spatial model",,'Elsevier BV'

Brady, Martin Stjernman, Henrik G. Smith, Henrik G. Smith",2021,"Most landscapes are comprised of multiple habitat types differing in the biodiversity they contain. This is certainly true for human modified landscapes, which are often a mix of habitats managed with different intensity, semi-natural habitats and even pristine habitats. To understand fundamental questions of how the composition of such landscapes affects biodiversity conservation, and to evaluate biodiversity consequences of policies that affect the composition of landscapes, there is a need for models able to translate information on biodiversity from individual habitats to landscape-wide predictions. However, this is complicated by species richness not being additive. We constructed a model to help analyze and solve this problem based on two simple assumptions. Firstly, that a habitat can be characterized by the biological community inhabiting it; i.e., which species occur and at what densities. Secondly, that the probability of a species occurring in a particular unit of land is dictated by its average density in the associated habitats, its spatial aggregation, and the size of the land unit. This model leads to a multidimensional species-area relation (one dimension per habitat). If the goal is to maximize species diversity at the landscape scale (γ-diversity), within a fixed area or under a limited budget, the model can be used to find the optimal allocation of the different habitats. In general, the optimal solution depends on the total size of the species pool of the different habitats, but also their similarity (β-diversity). If habitats are complementary (high β), a mix is usually preferred, even if one habitat is poorer (lower α diversity in one habitat). The model lends itself to economic analyses of biodiversity problems, without the need to monetarize biodiversity value, i.e., cost-effectiveness analysis. Land prices and management costs will affect the solution, such that the model can be used to estimate the number of species gained in relation to expenditure on each habitat. We illustrate the utility of the model by applying it to agricultural landscapes in southern Sweden and demonstrate how empirical monitoring data can be used to find the best habitat allocation for biodiversity conservation within and between landscapes",,article,"species-area relation, biodiversity, landscape, mosaic, community, agri-environment schemes, General.

To this end, we jointly contrast the habitat amount hypothesis and countryside biogeography with patch size and isolation concepts from island biogeography. Location: Three multi-habitat landscapes in Peneda-Gerês National Park, NW Portugal. Taxon: Macro-moths (Lepidoptera). Methods: Light-trapping using a semi-nested design at 84 fixed sites which were each repeatedly sampled six times. Results: Autocovariate models show that sampling sites with a higher number of forest and meadow macro-moth species (alpha diversity) were surrounded by a higher amount of forest and meadow habitat, respectively within a 160 and 320 m radius (scale of effect). These top-ranked models, containing only habitat amount as a significant variable, had lower AIC than models (only) containing patch size and/or isolation. Complementary to this, the countryside species-area relationship (SAR) model outperforms the classic SAR model, so that the effective area of habitat explains landscape species richness (gamma diversity) across spatial scales (beta diversity) better than the classic SAR. Specifically, we show that forest macro-moths have a higher spatial turnover than meadow macro-moths and that, on average, there are more species in forest than in meadow habitat. Main conclusions: The habitat amount hypothesis predicts alpha species richness in multi-habitat landscapes better than do patch size and isolation while the countryside SAR predicts beta and gamma diversity better than the classic SAR. We suggest that evidence is mounting to revise the application of the classical approaches of island biogeography and metapopulation theory to conservation biogeography",,info:eu-repo/semantics/dataset,"Life sciences, medicine and health care, Life sciences, medicine and health care",,Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS)

The density–area method estimates minimum patch size as the smallest area in which no new individuals are encountered as one extends the arbitrary boundaries of a study area outward. The density–area method eliminates the assumption of no variation in density with size of habitat area that accompanies other methods, but it is untested in situations in which habitat loss has confined populations to small areas. We used a variant of the density–area method to study the minimum patch size for the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) in Florida, USA, where this keystone species is being confined to ever smaller habitat fragments. The variant was based on the premise that individuals within populations are likely to occur at unusually high densities when confined to small areas, and it estimated minimum patch size as the smallest area beyond which density plateaus. The data for our study came from detailed surveys of 38 populations of the tortoise. For all 38 populations, the areas occupied were determined empirically, and for 19 of them, duplicate surveys were undertaken about a decade apart. We found that a consistent inverse density–area relationship was present over smaller areas. The minimum patch size estimated from the density–area relationship was at least 100 ha, which is substantially larger than previous estimates. The relative abundance of juveniles was inversely related to population density for sites with relatively poor habitat quality, indicating that the estimated minimum patch size could represent an extinction threshold. We concluded that a negative density–area relationship may be an inevitable consequence of excessive habitat loss. We also concluded that any detrimental effects of an inverse density–area relationship may be exacerbated by the deterioration in habitat quality that often accompanies habitat loss. Finally, we concluded that the value of any estimate of minimum patch size as a conservation tool is compromised by excessive habitat loss",,article,"density–area relationship, extinction threshold, Florida, USA, gopher tortoise, Gopherus polyphemus, habitat loss, habitat quality, minimum viable population size, patch context, patch size, scaling, Medical Sciences, Medicine and Health Sciences",,'Wiley'

Home range size, or the area used by individual organisms, is a critical ecological variable that integrates behaviour, physiology and population density and strongly depends on organism size. Here we present a new model of home range–body size scaling based on fractal resource distributions, in which resource encounter rates are a function of body size. The model predicts no universally constant scaling exponent for home range, but defines a possible range of values set by geometric limits to resource density and distribution. The model unifies apparently conflicting earlier results and explains differences in scaling exponents among herbivorous and carnivorous mammals and birds. We apply the model to predict that home range increases with habitat fragmentation, and that the home ranges of larger species should be much more sensitive to habitat fragmentation than those of smaller species.",,,,,

This empirical relationship is determined using correlative models that relate the presence/absence of a species with abiotic factors under the assumption that species are in equilibrium with its environment, but without taking into account population processes explicitly. The lack of a mechanism that explicitly relates population processes to the niche hinders to interpret results and obtain general conclusions. In this paper the relationship between habitat suitability and abundance under different dispersal scenarios is explored using a virtual species. A clear correlation between abundance and habitat suitability in scenarios without dispersal was found, on the other hand, this correlation decreased as the proportion of individuals who are dispersed increases. These results support the idea  that there is a relationship between habitat suitability and abundances, however, they also show that this relationship is modulated by dispersal.    Trabajos recientes basados en modelación del nicho para estimar la distribución de las especies han aportado evidencias de que la abundancia de una especie decrece conforme aumenta la distancia al centroide del nicho climático de la especie. Esta relación empírica se ha determinado utilizando modelos correlativos que relacionan datos de presencia/ausencia de una especie con factores abióticos, bajo el supuesto de que las especies se encuentran en equilibrio con su ambiente, pero sin tomar en cuenta explícitamente procesos poblacionales. La falta de un mecanismo que relacione explícitamente procesos poblacionales con el nicho de la especie dificulta la interpretación de los resultados y la obtención de conclusiones generales. En este trabajo se explora la relación entre la idoneidad del hábitat y la abundancia bajo diferentes escenarios de dispersión,  utilizando una especie virtual. Se encontró que, en un escenario sin dispersión, hay una clara correlación entre la abundancia y la idoneidad del hábitat, pero en aquellos en los que se incluye el proceso de dispersión, a medida que se incrementa la proporción de individuos que se dispersan, la correlación entre abundancia e idoneidad del hábitat disminuye.

habitat amount hypothesis,62616221,Habitat space and energy availability as determinants of size distributions of lotic assemblages,,"Lento, Jennifer",2010,"Size spectra in aquatic systems have shown a strong consistency of shape across a range of environmental conditions and among different groups of organisms, with higher normalized biomass of small organisms than large. Two main hypotheses have been proposed to explain this consistency in patterns. The energy hypothesis states that because of the inefficient transfer of energy between trophic levels, large organisms (as predators) have less energy available to them per unit habitat than small organisms. The habitat hypothesis states that space availability in the habitat shapes size spectra because small organisms perceive greater habitat space due to the presence of crevices and interstitial spaces that large organisms cannot access. My research examined body size spectra of organisms in 17 stream sites, testing both the energetic and habitat hypotheses for macroinvertebrates, crayfish, and fish. Body size research in lotic systems has rarely included all three groups of organisms, despite the potential importance of large organisms to ecosystem function. I developed a sampling method (electrobugging) to improve collection of large mobile macroinvertebrates; this method collected additional taxa and size classes not sampled by traditional methods. Slopes of size spectra including macroinvertebrates, crayfish, and fish were similar among sites. Large macroinvertebrates, crayfish, and fish contributed approximately half or more of the biomass in each site, while the contribution of small macroinvertebrates was negligible. To examine the habitat hypothesis, I developed a method to estimate habitat space from digital photographs of stream substrates by fitting organisms of different sizes to profiles extracted from the photos. Stable nitrogen isotopes were used to estimate trophic position and test the energetic hypothesis. The results of the test of both hypotheses suggested that both energy availability and space availability affected the normalized biomass of organisms in our study sites, although energy availability explained more of the variation in normalized biomass. The strong relationship between normalized biomass and delta15N suggested that energy availability contributed to primary structuring of size spectra, controlling the negative linear relationship of normalized biomass with size. Space availability had a weaker effect on normalized biomass, and may have contributed to secondary structuring of size spectra, controlling deviations from linearity in the normalized biomass-body size relationship",,Thesis,"Biology, Ecology.",,University of Ottawa (Canada)

In this perspective, selective extinction would be the likely cause of nestedness if an area- sorted matrix generates a nested pattern. On the other hand, if a nested pat-tern arises in an isolation- sorted matrix, differential immigration would be a better explanation for the nested structure (Wright et al., 1998).However, a simpler and predominant explanation for a nested pat-tern is based on the ‘passive sampling’ perspective (Connor & McCoy, 1979; Ulrich, Almeida- Neto, & Gotelli, 2009). In this perspective, habitat patches are analogous to ‘passive targets’ that randomly accumulate (or retain) individuals. Larger targets (or larger patches) accumulate more species from the regional pool than do smaller ones simply by chance. Similarly, more abundant species in the regional pool are more likely to occur in any patch than are rare species, also by chance only (Figure 1). Therefore, the passive sampling is an appropriate null perspective for explaining nestedness, especially in systems that cannot meet the as-sumptions of an equilibrium model (Cutler, 1994; MacArthur & Wilson, 1967). This is the case of dynamics or non- equilibrium patch systems (Shepherd & Brantley, 2005).F IGURE  1 Nestedness in assemblage structure.

A hypothetical gradient of favorability decreases from landscapes ‘a’ to ‘d’. More favorable landscapes are expected to contain more species. Favorability in (A) is represented by HA in the landscape. The HA hypothesis predicts that the number of species in a sample site increases with increasing HA in the landscape, even if the size of the patch where the sample site is embedded remains unchanged. We hypothesize that HA also allows to predict an assemblage's species composition because a nested pattern implies changes in species richness. Matrix resistance increases from ‘a’ to ‘d’ in (B). We predict that species richness is inversely related to matrix resistance to biological flow within the landscape if HA is held constant. Therefore, a low- resistance matrix allows the movement of a larger array of species in the landscape, while only stronger dispersers are capable of colonizing a patch surrounded by a highly resistant matrix [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]86  |     RABELO Et AL.Recently, Fahrig (2013) challenged the notion that patch size and isolation per se affect species distribution in patch systems, proposing that a ‘sample area effect’ drives their apparent effects. First, larger patches contain more species than smaller ones simply because they constitute a larger sample area in the landscape. Second, since the hab-itat amount (HA) within a landscape surrounding a focal patch is the primary source of colonists, the focal patch will be more isolated from its source of species as the HA in the landscape decreases. Therefore, the number of species in a focal patch depends on the sampled area represented by the surrounding habitat, which affects its immigration rate (Figure 2A), that is, a larger HA in the landscape will sample a larger portion of the regional species pool. The ‘HA hypothesis’ posits that HA in a local landscape is the main driver of species distribution in patchy systems because it combines the effects of both patch size and isolation into a single predictor. This hypothesis has raised a current debate in landscape ecology for explaining patterns of species richness in patch systems (Haddad et al., 2017; Hanski, 2015; Melo, Sponchiado, Cáceres, & Fahrig, 2017; Rabelo, Bicca- Marques, Aragón, & Nelson, 2017).Matrix type can also affect species richness in habitat patches (Prevedello & Vieira, 2010), although the HA hypothesis posits that it has a secondary role compared to the HA effect (Fahrig, 2013). Matrix type contributes to effective patch isolation because its permeability/resistance may facilitate/compromise biological flow (Metzger & Décamps, 1997). Although the HA hypothesis deals pri-marily with species richness as the response variable, we propose that HA, together with matrix resistance, can also predict species composition of a nested- structured assemblage (Figure 2B). We base our hypothesis on the fact that nestedness necessarily implies that species richness varies across patches.Here, we analyze the pattern and potential drivers of mammal as-semblage composition on river islands in central Amazon. These fluvial islands originate from a complex river dynamics that constantly modi-fies the spatial structure of riverscapes (Peixoto, Nelson, & Wittmann, 2009), which makes them a non- equilibrium patch system (Shepherd & Brantley, 2005). We have previously tested the HA hypothesis in this system and shown that island size only affects the number of species because of the sample area effect (Rabelo et al., 2017). Here, we in-vestigate whether island assemblages show a nested pattern and test whether species’ regional abundances predict their occurrence on islands. We expect that a species' relative abundance in the regional pool determines its local island occurrence (Figure 1), suggesting that the passive sampling null model is a parsimonious explanation for the structure of the species assemblages found on these islands.We also test the HA hypothesis using species composition, not richness, as the response variable. Our aim here was to evaluate whether and how assemblage structure responds to HA and to ma-trix resistance at multiple spatial scales of local landscapes. If these landscape variables are associated with assemblage structure as ex-pected (Figure 2), the HA in the landscape is also a good predictor of species composition on this patch system.2  | MATERIAL AND METHODS2.1 | Study area and study speciesWe sampled islands and the continuous forest near the confluence of the Solimões and Japurá rivers in central Amazon (Figure 3).

Várzea forests are seasonally flooded by nutrient- rich white- water rivers (Prance, 1979). The aver-age annual range of the water level is 12 m (Ramalho et al., 2009), reaching its maximum level around June and its minimum between October and November (IDSM 2010).River dynamics constantly modifies the spatial structure of these riverscapes (Peixoto et al., 2009; Puhakka, Kalliola, Rajasilta, & Salo, 1992), creating fluvial islands by the erosion, transport, and deposition of sediments (Kalliola, Salo, Puhakka, & Rajasilta, 1991). Here, we consider the fluvial islands within these river-scapes as our model of habitat patches. River dynamics affects species distribution in terrestrial environments (Toivonen, Maki, & Kalliola, 2007) and can facilitate dispersal and influence species’ occurrence on fluvial islands (e.g., birds: Cintra, Sanaiotti, & Cohn- Haft, 2007; and primates: Rabelo et al., 2014). Although fluvial is-lands can be considered ephemeral patches for species with long generation times (Shepherd & Brantley, 2005), we consider them appropriate patch models to test the HA hypothesis. We restricted our sample to islands that have lasted long enough to sustain two or more generations of the species of our study group to minimize the influence of ephemeral islands on the results (see ‘Sampling design’ section, below).The mammals inhabiting várzea forests are mostly arbo-real (primates and sloths). However, scansorial (anteaters and squirrels) and terrestrial (coatis and jaguars) species can also be present. Long- term studies within the Mamirauá Reserve have shown that even jaguars reside and remain in the flooded forest during the high- water season (E. E. Ramalho, unpublished data). The arboreal mammals rarely descend to the ground, but can occasionally move through shrubby and herbaceous vegetation, walk on sandy substrates, or even swim in rivers and lakes. The terrestrial species also spend most of their time in the canopy, especially during flooding. Therefore, we only consider those environments that fulfill all requirements to constitute ‘habitat’ for our mammal assemblage as structured forests (Fahrig, 2013). Várzea forest mammals are good study models because they often reach high population densities (Peres, 1997), thereby increasing survey detection rate and reducing the risk of false negatives.2.2 | Sampling designWe adopted a mixed patch- landscape scale sampling design. In this approach, each landscape represents a sample unit. The response variable is measured within a focal patch (the island), whereas the predictor variable can be measured both at the patch and at the surrounding local landscape within a given distance from the focal patch (McGarigal & Cushman, 2002). An alternative adaptation of the patch- landscape design assesses the response variable not in the patches, but in equal- sized sample sites with landscape- scale pre-dictors measured within a specific radius from them (Fahrig, 2013; Figure 2).We sampled 14 focal islands (Supporting information Table S1) and adopted a multi- scale approach to find the appropriate scale to detect the predictor's effects on our study group, the scale of effect (Martin & Fahrig, 2012). We used 12 buffer distances (500–6,000 m, at 500- m intervals) from the sample sites of each island to define that sample's local landscape for each scale (Figure 3). We chose the islands based on the following criteria: (a) surrounded by water, even during the low- water season; (b) minimum distance between islands’ edges of 2 km to avoid overlapping landscapes (only 2 out of 14 landscapes overlapped at the buffer scales of 3,000–6,000 m); and (c) minimum age of 30 years (determined using a historical series of Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite images) to avoid islands that are too ephemeral for our study group (e.g., jaguar generation time ~7 years, de la Torre, González- Maya, Zarza, Ceballos, & Medellín, 2018). We removed newly formed islands younger than 30 years be-cause this period is insufficient for the development of a forest with an adequate structure to harbor arboreal mammals. Islands under this age are dominated by pioneer vegetation and rarely hold late- succession forest patches (Peixoto et al., 2009; Wittmann, Junk, & Piedade, 2004).2.3 | Data collectionMammal sampling was conducted along a single linear transect on each island (Figure 3). Transect length varied from 1.2 to 11.6 km and it was directly correlated to island size (Pearson correlation: r = 0.94, p < 0.001), making patch size an intrinsic characteristic of each sample. We also surveyed mammals at nine independent sam-ple sites distributed in the adjacent continuous floodplain forest (black squares in Figure 3) to estimate the relative regional abun-dance of species in the source pool. Surveys consisted of quiet walks on trails by two trained observers at ca. 1.5 km/hr following a stand-ardized protocol (Peres, 1999). We carried out the surveys in the morning (06:30–11:30 hr) and afternoon (14:00–17:00 hr), interrupt-ing them during rains. We recorded species via sighting and vestiges, such as calls and feces. We also recorded the occurrence of jaguars and semi- arboreal species via footprints and fresh signs of digging. We conducted four surveys per transect, separated by no more than 4 days, during the low- water season (September to November) of either 2013 or 2014. We limited surveys to the low- water season to minimize potential seasonal effects on species detection. We were unable to visit all islands during a single low- water season due to logistical constraints.We used a Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) scene from 24 October 2014 (low- water season) to extract the landscape cover types and their spatial configurations. As the water level drops, areas of sand, and herbaceous and shrub vegetation emerge, nar-rowing the width of rivers and adding heterogeneity to the matrix surrounding islands. All GIS processing was undertaken using QGIS software version 2.8.1 (QGIS Development Team 2015). We used three of the OLI spectral bands (near infrared, red, and green) at a 30- m spatial resolution to perform a semi- supervised classification using the Semi- Automatic Classification Plugin available in QGIS. We 88  |     RABELO Et AL.obtained 8 to 15 training areas for each of five pre- defined cover classes (forest, shrub, herbaceous, sand, and water) via visual inter-pretation of a false- color composite of the same three bands. We found an accuracy between 94.8% and 97.1% in the validation of our classifications. Forest was defined as habitat, whereas the other four classes were treated as matrix types. We used the classified raster image to calculate the area of habitat within each local landscape at each buffer scale, that is, the habitat amount (HA) metric.We obtained a metric of matrix resistance (MR) for each sur-rounding landscape at each buffer scale. This metric considered the distance to habitat, the resistance of each matrix type to animal movement, and the matrix area in the local landscape (Metzger & Décamps, 1997), as follows:where IEi = Ii * Ri represents the effective isolation of pixel ‘i’; Ii is the linear distance from pixel ‘i’ to the nearest pixel of habitat; Ri is the resistance coefficient to biological flow of the matrix type present in pixel ‘i’; and AM is the number of matrix pixels within the landscape.Resistance coefficients (Ri) are necessary because of the scar-city of studies on animal movement (Zeller, McGarigal, & Whiteley, 2012). In the absence of data to estimate resistance values, we con-sulted expert researchers. We sent a closed format questionnaire (Appendix S1) to 50 mammal specialists, asking them to assign a re-sistance weight from 0 to 10 to each matrix type for each species individually and for the overall group of species. A ‘0’ resistance indi-cates a fully permeable environment similar to the forested habitat, whereas a ‘10’ value qualifies a matrix type as highly resistant to bi-ological flow comparable to an impermeable barrier to animal move-ment. We received responses from 29 experts (=58% response rate). Specialists tended to assign an increasing resistance from shrub to herbaceous vegetation, then to sand and, finally, water (Supporting information Figure S3). We took the median of all scores of each matrix type as its resistance coefficient (Ri) because the response distribution was asymmetric. We estimated habitat amount and ma-trix resistance for each spatial scale of the local landscapes. These metrics were calculated using the ‘raster’ 2.2–31 (Hijmans, 2014) and ‘sp’ (Bivand, Pebesma, & Gomez- Rubio, 2013) packages in R 3.1.3 software (R Development Core Team 2015).2.4 | Data analysisWe constructed a matrix of species abundance by site: a table of species (columns) versus sites (rows) containing the raw counts of each species on each island. We excluded two islands from the ma-trix because they harbored no mammal. We estimated the degree of nestedness of mammal assemblages across the remaining 12 is-lands using metrics based on overlap and decreasing fill with both presence–absence (NODF) and abundance data (WNODF; Almeida- Neto & Ulrich, 2011). We determined the significance of nestedness using a null model that changes matrix structure while maintaining column and row marginal totals (i.e., the fixed- fixed [FF] algorithm) to simulate 1,000 random matrices, following the recommended ap-prouach of Ulrich et al. (2009). We performed this analysis using the NODF Program (Almeida- Neto & Ulrich, 2011). We also separated the nestedness component from the turnover component to evalu-ate their independent contributions to the total variation of species composition in the assemblage (i.e., beta- diversity) as proposed by Baselga (2010). This analysis was performed using the ‘betapart’ R package (Baselga, Orme, Villeger, Bortoli, & Leprieur, 2018).We also assessed the change in species composition across the study islands via a non- metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) or-dination of the species- site matrix. Prior to performing the matrix or-dination, we controlled for the sample area effect as our islands had different sampling efforts according to island size. We accomplished this task by dividing the abundance of species in each matrix cell by the total abundance in the matrix row (site). We performed this stan-dardization of samples to equal totals (SAT) to reduce the discrepancy between sites with different sampling efforts (i.e., the sample area effect). We also applied SAT to matrix columns (species) to minimize the difference between abundant and rare species. Standardization of the species- site matrices prior to ordination procedures helps to identify the strongest intrinsic pattern of assemblage structure, and SAT has been recognized as a robust standardization method for ecological ordinations (Faith, Minchin, & Belbin, 1987). We then per-formed a two- axis NMDS ordination based on the Bray–Curtis pair-wise dissimilarities between sample sites, reducing the assemblage structure pattern to two axes (McCune & Grace, 2002).We fitted a simple regression model to test whether the rela-tive regional abundance of a species's predicts its respective oc-currence on islands. We used the species scores derived from the NMDS ordination as the response variable to fit this model. These species’ scores correspond to the order of species in the ordered species- site matrix, that is, they represent the species relative inci-dence on islands according to the NMDS ordination. We also con-structed a species- site matrix with the continuous forest sample sites, then applied the same standardization procedure with the SAT method, and used the sum of the relative abundances of spe-cies in all sample sites to represent the relative regional abundance of each species.We used each site's score on the first NMDS axis to represent its mammal assemblage composition. To evaluate how species composition responds to habitat amount and matrix resistance, we initially found the scale at which each predictor best predicts the re-sponse variable, namely the scale of effect (Martin & Fahrig, 2012). Therefore, we used an AIC model selection approach to choose the best scale of effect for each predictor variable (habitat amount and matrix resistance), as predictors may have different scales of effect (see Appendix S3). After having found the scale of effect for each landscape predictor, we used another model selection procedure to evaluate how landscape predictors affect species composition, ac-cording to four candidate models with the following predictors: null, HA only, MR only, and HA + MR. We also included island size as a predictor in candidate models to evaluate whether it affects species composition (see Appendix S3). We performed these analyses using MR=∑AMi=1IEiAM     |  89RABELO Et AL.the vegan 2.2- 1 (Oksanen et al., 2013) package, inside R 3.1.3 statis-tical software (R Development Core Team 2015).3  | RESULTSWe found seven mammal species (Supporting information Table S2) belonging to the orders Primates (2), Pilosa (2), Carnivora (2), and Rodentia (1). The first NMDS axis explained 50% of the variation in species composition among sample sites (Figure 4A).The nestedness of both the occurrence and the abundance- based matrices did not differ significantly from null assem-blages (NODFOBS = 74.39; NODFEXP = 71.83; p = 0.42; and WNODFOBS = 53.27; WNODFEXP = 48.94; p = 0.30). Accordingly, the relative regional abundance of a species predicted its incidence on islands (F1,5 = 16.29; R² = 0.77; p < 0.01, Figure 4B). The higher the regional abundance of a species, the higher its frequency of island occupancy (Figure 4B). We found that both turnover and nestedness components contributed similarly to the overall beta- diversity (βOVERALL) of the islands’ mammal assemblages (βTURN-OVER = 0.38; βNESTEDNESS = 0.34; βOVERALL = 0.72).Habitat amount in the landscape and matrix resistance affected species composition at different scales of effect (HA at 3,000 m: slope = 1.32, p < 0.001; MR at 500 m: slope = −0.25, p = 0.02; supporting information Figure S4). However, the best explanatory model only included HA, which successfully predicted the mam-mal species composition of our study fluvial islands (F1,10 = 26.11; R² = 0.72; p < 0.001; Figure 4C; Table 1). Island size and matrix re-sistance had significant effects on species composition only when analyzed alone, that is, they did not affect species composition after controlling for the effect of HA in the landscape (Supporting infor-mation Table S7).4  | DISCUSSION4.1 | ‘Equilibrium’ versus ‘Passive sampling’ perspectivesWe did not detect a significant nested pattern in the assemblage structure. The observed NODF and WNODF values, which did not differ from expected null model values, imply a random structure of mammal assemblage in these fluvial islands. Additionally, the F IGURE  4 Structure of the mammal assemblage of central Amazon River islands. (A) Islands sorted by the NMDS 1 axis according to the NMDS ordination.

Therefore, the species’ abundance in the regional pool best explains the structuring of our study is-land assemblages via the underlying process of passive sampling. Our results are compatible with meta- analyses showing that, when conservative null models are used, significant nestedness is consid-erably less common than previously reported (Matthews, Cottee- Jones, & Whittaker, 2015; Ulrich et al., 2009).We found that the overall beta- diversity pattern of our mam-mal assemblage in Amazonian fluvial islands may be similarly par-titioned into turnover and nestedness components. This means that two processes can equally generate the assemblages’ beta- diversity: species replacement from the turnover component, and species loss from the nestedness component (Baselga, 2010). This finding corroborates the nestedness analysis performed with NODF and WNODF metrics in which we did not find a significant nested structure as expected by chance. However, as stated by Baselga (2010), we highlight that nestedness and dissimilarity due to nestedness are related but different concepts. The βNESTEDNESS index is a metric rooted in the framework of beta- diversity analy-ses, and it is not a measure of nestedness in absolute terms unlike the NODF and WNODF metrics. Instead, βNESTEDNESS is an index of dissimilarity used to account for the patterns of beta- diversity caused by nestedness.Under the equilibrium perspective, extinction–colonization dy-namics manly drives species richness and composition in habitat patches (MacArthur & Wilson, 1967). Selective extinction occurs at a rate inversely proportional to patch size especially in land- bridge systems where a species occupies habitat patches prior to their isolation (Leibold & Mikkelson, 2002). On the other hand, nested patterns caused by differential immigration resulting from dispersal limitation are expected to occur in systems composed by previously vacant patches at the time of their creation (Cook & Quinn, 1995).Fluvial islands contain particular habitat conditions that affect the occurrence of species. They originate from (a) the deposition of sediments as sandbars in the river channel that are followed by pri-mary succession (Kalliola et al., 1991; Puhakka et al., 1992) or (b) the erosion of river meanders, pinching off a peninsula of continuous floodplain forest (Peixoto et al., 2009; Puhakka et al., 1992). Given that both processes can play a role in the emergence of our study islands, we cannot rule out the possibility that these islands have different long- term abiotic and biotic histories, beyond the 30- year time window available from satellite images. Therefore, we cannot reject the potential effects of these historical processes in creating the observed non- significant nested structure of our study mammal assemblages under the equilibrium perspective.4.2 | Habitat amount hypothesisHA in the landscape predicted the mammal assemblage structure of our study islands particularly at the 3,000- m scale. Both the HA hy-pothesis and the passive sampling explanation for nestedness argue that the sample area effect explains the patch size effect: Larger habitat patches ‘sample’ more species from the regional pool than do smaller habitat patches (Connor & McCoy, 1979; Fahrig, 2013). The passive sampling model further predicts the species composi-tion by considering that the abundance of a species in the regional pool  affects its probability of occurrence in a given patch.We have previously shown that the size of these fluvial islands has a direct influence on their species richness simply as a conse-quence of the sample area effect (Rabelo et al., 2017); that is, HA in the surrounding landscape, instead of island size, explains the number of species sighted in transects of equal length. Here, we show that island size also does not affect species composition at sample sites after controlling for the effect of HA in the landscape (Supporting information Table S7). Therefore, we combined sample area effect and the perspective of passive sampling to show that HA in the landscape also drives the structuring of the mammal assem-blage of these islands. That is, landscapes containing higher amounts of habitat sample more species than those with less habitat, and more abundant species are more likely to be ‘sampled’.The relationship between area and species richness or composi-tion under the passive sampling viewpoint is solely a sampling phe-nomenon, rather than the outcome of biological processes, such as extinction or immigration (Connor & McCoy, 1979). This is the rea-son why the passive sampling is a null hypothesis. However, we argue that this simplification requires caution because a species’ common-ness or rarity in a given region likely relates to its biology and ecology. Therefore, the role of ecological traits, such as species abundance, should also be acknowledged. On the other hand, the HA hypothesis does not deny that extinction and colonization can drive species rich-ness in habitat patches (Fahrig, 2013). Instead, it states that there is TABLE  1 Ranking of explanatory models of the mammal species composition of Amazonian fluvial islands. NMDS 1 is the site scores from an NMDS ordination and represents the species composition of each island. The models evaluate how the species composition responds to habitat amount (HA) and to matrix resistance (MR) at their scales of effect (3,000 m for HA and 500 m for MR).

The latter hypothesis further implies that the effects of patch size and isolation are redundant because they are components of HA in the landscape, whose influence on species richness takes place mainly via the sample area effect.4.3 | Matrix resistanceWe only found a significant response of species composition to matrix resistance at the 500- m spatial scale when the model only included this predictor, although this model was not chosen as a plausible explanatory one in the selection procedure (Table 1). The lack of association between matrix resistance and assemblage struc-ture can result from the fact that we measured the former during the low- water season of 2014. As the water level can vary up to 12 m (Ramalho et al., 2009) between the low- and high- water sea-sons, matrix resistance also varies from higher values during the high- water season to lower values in the dry season. This seasonal pattern means that mammals can colonize islands more easily in October than in June. Additionally, the ability to move through the matrix is species- specific (Prevedello & Vieira, 2010). That is, assem-blage components do not respond uniformly to matrix resistance if their vagilities differ. Therefore, when matrix type affects a patch's species richness, its effects are often weaker than those of HA. Consequently, analyzing the effects of matrix on individual species is a stronger approach.5  | CONCLUSIONSPassive sampling explains the structuring of the mammal assem-blages of central Amazon River islands: (a) Larger islands contain more species simply because they are larger ‘targets’ and, consequently, sample more species from the regional pool; and (b) the species com-position of islands reflects the species’ abundances in the regional pool because common species are more likely to occur in any given island than rare ones. Despite the discussion on whether extinction or colonization generates nestedness, habitat amount in the surrounding landscape stood out as an effective and straightforward predictor of species composition of fluvial islands. The identification of single and easy- to- measure variables is critical in the current context of press-ing conservation challenges (Fahrig, 2013). We suggest that habitat amount can also be useful for predicting species composition and species richness in other patchy systems. Finally, we conclude that the passive sampling hypothesis is more appropriate than an island biogeography perspective for explaining the patterns of mammal as-semblage structure in our study fluvial islands.ACKNOWLEDG EMENTSThis research was funded by the Instituto de Desenvolvimento Sustentável Mamirauá (IDSM- OS/MCTI).

Estimated habitat areas satisfying 95–99% probability of a population persisting for 100–1000 yr range from 525 to 975 km2. However, confidence limits of parameters in the logistic regression equation are very large. Moreover, the number of extinct population might be underestimated in the empirical data. Consequently, a much wider habitat area (>1000 km2) should be considered for actual conservation planning for local populations of Japanese macaques.

In the past, papers presenting single SAR curves prevailed. Recently, also unifying works have appeared. One approach has focused on the possible relationship between mean number of individuals per species and the rate of increase of number of species with area. According to this theory higher mean species abundance leads to lower values of SAR curve slope. Moreover, there is one prediction based on maximization of entropy principle (MaxEnt) that is able to give us particular values of SAR's slope when we provide the values of mean species abundance. There are also other approaches except for MaxEnt one that deals with mean species abundance and reached similar results. The main aim of this work was to gather all possible data about slopes of SARs and mean species abundances and find out possible relationships between these two variables. I have also included several other variables into the analyses to reveal the importance of them as predictors for the values of the slope. I performed two main groups of analyses.

We developed an individual-based model of home range establishment that, given a mapped distribution of local habitat values, estimates species abundance by simulating the number and position of viable home ranges that can be maintained across a spatially heterogeneous area. We estimated parameters for this model from data on red-backed vole (Myodes gapperi) abundances in 31 boreal forest sites in Ontario, Canada. The home range model had considerably more support from these data than both non-spatial regression models based on the same original habitat variables and a mean-abundance null model. It had nearly equivalent support to a non-spatial regression model that, like the home range model, scaled an aggregate measure of habitat value from local associations with habitat resources. The home range and habitat-value regression models gave similar predictions for vole abundance under simulations of light- and moderate-intensity partial forest harvesting, but the home range model predicted lower abundances than the regression model under high-intensity disturbance. Empirical regression-based approaches for predicting species abundance may overlook processes that affect habitat use by individuals, and often extrapolate poorly to novel habitat conditions. Mechanistic home range models that can be parameterized against abundance data from different habitats permit appropriate scaling from individual- to population-level habitat relationships, and can potentially provide better insights into responses to disturbance",,article,"Medicine, R, Science, Q",issn:1932-6203,Public Library of Science (PLoS)

However, the TIB remains silent about functional trait composition and provides no information on the scaling of functional diversity with area, an observation that is now documented in many systems. To fill this gap, we develop a probabilistic approach to predict the distribution of a trait as a function of habitat area and isolation, extending the TIB beyond the traditional species-area relationship. We compare model predictions to the body-size distribution of piscivorous and herbivorous fishes found on tropical reefs worldwide. We find that small and isolated reefs have a higher proportion of large-sized species than large and connected reefs. We also find that knowledge of species body-size and trophic position improves the predictions of fish occupancy on tropical reefs, supporting both the allometric and trophic theory of island biogeography.

Animal space use should therefore vary according to habitat characteristics, a process known as the """"functional response"""" in habitat selection. This response has often been tested vis-à-vis the proportion of a habitat category within areas available to individuals. Measuring sought-after resources in landscape where they are continuously distributed is a challenge and we posit here that both the mean availability of a resource and its spatial variation should be measured. Accordingly, we tested for a functional response in habitat selection according to these two descriptors of the resource available for a mountain herbivore. We hypothesized that selection should decrease with mean value of resources available and increase with its spatial variation. Based on GPS data from 50 chamois females and data on the actual foodscape (i.e., distribution of edible-only biomass in the landscape), we estimated individual selection ratio (during summer months) for biomass at the home range level, comparing edible biomass in individual home ranges and the mean and standard deviation of edible biomass in their available range. Chamois being a group-living species, available accessible ranges were shared by several individuals that formed socio-spatial groups (clusters) in the population. As expected, selection ratios increased with the standard deviation of edible resources in each cluster, but unlike our prediction, was unrelated to its mean. Selection of areas richer in resources hence did not fade away when more resources were available on average, a result that may be explained by the need for this capital breeder species to accumulate fat-reserve at a high rate during summer months. Low spatial variation could limit the selection of chamois, which highlights the importance of resource distribution in the process of habitat selection",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/article, Journal articles","chamois, foodscape, mountain ungulate, Rupicapra rupicapra, [SDE.BE]Environmental Sciences/Biodiversity and Ecology, [SDV.BA.ZV]Life Sciences [q-bio]/Animal biology/Vertebrate Zoology",,'Oxford University Press (OUP)'

Conversely, even though ecological models and experiments have demonstrated the importance of spatial heterogeneity for the rate of population change, we still have no practical method for making the connection between the makeup of real environments, the expected distribution and fitness of their occupants, and the long-term implications of fitness for population growth. Here, we synthesize several conceptual advances into a mathematical framework using a measure of fitness to link habitat availability/selection to (density-dependent) population growth in mobile animal species. A key feature of this approach is that it distinguishes between apparent habitat suitability and the true, underlying contribution of a habitat to fitness, allowing the statistical coefficients of both to be estimated from multiple observation instances of the species in different environments and stages of numerical growth. Hence, it leverages data from both historical population time series and snapshots of species distribution to predict population performance under environmental change. We propose this framework as a foundation for building more realistic connections between a population's use of space and its subsequent dynamics (and hence a contribution to the ongoing efforts to estimate a species' critical habitat and fundamental niche). We therefore detail its associated definitions and simplifying assumptions, because they point to the framework's future extensions. We show how the model can be fit to data on species distributions and population dynamics, using standard statistical methods, and we illustrate its application with an individual-based simulation. When contrasted with nonspatial population models, our approach is better at fitting and predicting population growth rates and carrying capacities. Our approach can be generalized to include a diverse range of biological considerations.

The published article can be found at: http://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/10.1002/%28ISSN%292150-8925/Patterns of β diversity are commonly used to infer underlying ecological processes. In this study, we examined the effect of spatial configuration of habitat capacity on different metrics of β diversity, i.e., β diversity measured as turnover and as variation. For β diversity as turnover, a monotonic species spatial turnover pattern is typically considered as a benchmark for species distributions driven only by dispersal process. Deviations from a monotonic curve are attributed to local environmental filtering (i.e., the same environmental factors affecting different species differently). However, we found non-monotonicity in species spatial turnover in models without environmental filtering effect. This non-monotonicity was caused by variation in α diversity, introduced by spatial configuration of habitat capacity. After applying a recent null-model approach—designed to tease out the effect of variation in α diversity—species spatial turnover remained non-monotonic. This non-monotonicity makes it problematic to use species spatial turnover to infer the underlying processes for species distribution, i.e., whether it is driven by environmental filtering or dispersal processes. Spatial configuration of habitat capacity also influences landscape connectivity. Small-habitat capacity sites may constrain movements of organisms (i.e., dispersal) between sites supporting high capacity habitats. We showed that in a landscape where small-habitat capacity sites were located in positions important for dispersal (e.g., in the center as opposed to on the edge of a landscape) has a higher spatial variation of species composition, hence, higher β diversity. Ecologists who use different measures of β diversity should be aware of these effects introduced by spatial configuration of habitat capacity",,Article,"beta diversity, habitat capacity, landscape connectivity, monotonicity, similarity indices, spatial configuration, species spatial turnover",,Ecological Society of America

Studies of distribution often use occurrence data to build models of the environmental niche of a species. Environmental suitability (ES) derived from such models may be used to predict the potential distributions of species. The ability of such models to predict spatial patterns in abundance is unknown; we argue that there should be a positive relationship between ES and local abundance. This will be so if ES reflects how well the species’ physiological and ecological requirements are met at a site and if those factors also determine local abundance. However, the presence of other factors may indicate that potential abundance is not attained at all sites. Therefore, ES should predict the upper limit of abundance, and the observed relationship with ES should be wedge shaped. We tested the relationship of ES with local abundance for 69 rain forest vertebrates in the Australian wet tropics. Ordinary least squares and quantile regressions revealed a positive relationship between ES and local abundance for most species (>84%). The relationships for these species were wedge shaped. We conclude that ES modeled from presence‐only data provides useful information on spatial patterns of abundance, and we discuss implications of this in addressing important problems in ecology",,"Article, PeerReviewed",,,'University of Chicago Press'

The IDH proposes patterns of peaked diversity under intermediate disturbance regimes, based on a tension between competitively superior species and species which can rapidly colonize following disturbance. We review the literature, and describe recent research that suggests that more than one underlying mechanism can generate this unimodal diversity pattern in disturbed environments. Several exciting emerging research areas are identified, including interactions between disturbance types, operation of the IDH in multi-trophic systems, and changes in disturbance regimes.

We discuss how to extend methods for identifying different coexistence mechanisms, developed in the theoretical literature, to experimental research. In an attempt to operationalize these various ideas we outline a hypothetical IDH research programme.

Recent laboratory work has shown that disturbance may act to increase diversity in softbottom marine communities as predicted by the hypothesis. In this paper, we present the results of a field experiment which tested the impacts of physical disturbance on soft-bottom, intertidal macrobenthic communities. Five disturbance treatments were used, differing in the frequency of applied disturbance events; the highest frequency treatments were dug every week, lowest every eight weeks. The experiment was run for a total of 25 weeks over the winter of 1997/98. Our experiment controlled for differences in recovery time after disturbances. Abundances of Pygospio elegans, Macoma balthica, Hydrobia ulvae and Streblospio benedicti were all significantly reduced in high disturbance treatments, as was the total number of species. No species showed significant increases in abundance in disturbed treatments,and there was no evidence of an increase in diversity in any treatments. These results are discussed in the context of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Our results suggest that the interspecific competitive effects postulated by the hypothesis are not important in structuring this low diversity, intertidal community.

Here, we examine IDH in the context of alien plant invasions. IDH can offer insight into the role of disturbance in facilitating plant invasions and the effect of these invasions on floristic diversity.Early stages of succession are most susceptible to invasion because resources and colonisation opportunities are elevated after disturbance. This trend is accentuated by human-mediated dispersal, a bias towards early successional species in the alien species pool, the tendency for fast-growing species to profit most from enemy release, and increased disturbance levels in human-modified habitats. Human disturbance, coupled with plant introductions, extends the diversity–disturbance curve and shifts peak diversity towards higher disturbance levels. However, invasive aliens can reduce native diversity at the community scale, especially in mid succession where competitive interactions structure communities. Certain invasive plants may have higher impacts because they overcome some life history tradeoffs as a result of their association with humans or novel evolutionary histories, e.g. enemy release. This may directly or indirectly (e.g. through plastic reallocation of resources from defence into growth) enable invasive plants to colonise earlier or persist into later stages of succession. By modifying disturbance regimes, invaders that transform the environment may also interfere with succession and precipitate low diversity communities. Low introduction rates of late successional species may currently limit impacts of aliens under infrequent disturbance.IDH is a useful framework for understanding ecological communities. However, because of the novel evolutionary histories of alien species and the anthropogenic context in which they invade, disturbance levels that maximise total diversity in invaded communities can differ from those that maximise native diversity. Joint consideration of IDH and alien invasion patterns suggests a range of strategies can be used to manage diversity",,,,,'Elsevier BV'

D., Roberts, G. T.",2007,"The effect of Mach number on the growth of unstable disturbances in a boundary layer undergoing a strong interaction with an impinging oblique shock wave is studied by direct numerical simulation and linear stability theory (LST). To reduce the number of independent parameters, test cases are arranged so that both the interaction location Reynolds number (based on the distance from the plate leading edge to the shock impingement location for a corresponding inviscid flow) and the separation bubble length Reynolds number are held fixed. Small-amplitude disturbances are introduced via both white-noise and harmonic forcing and, after verification that the disturbances are convective in nature, linear growth rates are extracted from the simulations for comparison with parallel flow LST and solutions of the parabolized stability equations (PSE). At Mach 2.0, the oblique modes are dominant and consistent results are obtained from simulation and theory. At Mach 4.5 and Mach 6.85, the linear Navier-Stokes results show large reductions in disturbance energy at the point where the shock impinges on the top of the separated shear layer. The most unstable second mode has only weak growth over the bubble region, which instead shows significant growth of streamwise structures. The two higher Mach number cases are not well predicted by parallel flow LST, which gives frequencies and spanwise wavenumbers that are significantly different from the simulations. The PSE approach leads to good qualitative predictions of the dominant frequency and wavenumber at Mach 2.0 and 4.5, but suffers from reduced accuracy in the region immediately after the shock impingement. Three-dimensional Navier-Stokes simulations are used to demonstrate that at finite amplitudes the flow structures undergo a nonlinear breakdown to turbulence.

In addition, the dominating dynamics in the disturbance kinetic energy equation is governed by the energy production, pressure-transport and viscous diffusion - also in contrast to the fully turbulent regime.

Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis,210902402,Diversity in planktonic communities: An experimental test of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis.,,"Flöder, S., Sommer, U.",1999,"According to Connell's intermediate disturbance hypothesis (LDH), diversity within a community is maximal at intermediate frequencies and intensities of disturbances. In order to test the IDH, disturbances of different frequencies and intensities were imposed on natural plankton communities in controlled field experiments. These disturbances consisted of an artificial deepening of the mixed layer, leading to the dilution of epilimnetic populations and to a higher level of nutrients. Intervals between disturbances ranged from 2 to 12 d. Different intensities of disturbance were caused by differences in the experimental mixing depth (150 and 225% of the original epilimnion depth). Investigation focused on the effect that disturbances had on the diversity of natural phytoplankton communities. Additionally we were interested in determining the effect of grazing by zooplankton. The results of the held experiments show for the first time the applicability of the IDH to phytoplankton within complete planktonic communities. Diversity showed a clear maximum at the intermediate disturbance interval of 6 d. Similarly, species number peaked at intermediate interval length (6-10 d)",,info:eu-repo/semantics/article,,,

The amplitude of this body sway is known to be larger than would be predicted from simple noise effects, and sway characteristics are changed by neurological disorders. This large sway is thought to arise from nonlinear control with prolonged periods of no control (intermittent control), and a nonlinear control system of this kind has been predicted to exhibit bifurcation. The presence of stability-dependent transition enables dynamic reaction that depends on the stability of the environment, and can explain the change in sway characteristics that accompanies some neurological disorders. This research analyses the characteristics of a system model that induces transition, and discusses whether human standing reflects such a mechanism. In mathematical analysis of system models, (intermittent control-like) nonlinear control with integral control is shown to exhibit Hopf bifurcation. Moreover, from the analytical solution of the system model with noise, noise is shown to work to smooth the enlargement of sway around the bifurcation point. This solution is compared with measured human standing sway on floors with different stabilities. By quantitatively comparing the control parameters between human observation and model prediction, enlargement of sway is shown to appear as predicted by the model analysis",,"Life sciences, medicine and health care","Life sciences, medicine and health care",,
Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis,539797271,The effect of colonization and competition processes on the relation between disturbance and diversity in plant communities,,"CORDONNIER, Thomas, COURBAUD, Benoît, FRANC, A.",2006,"Many theoretical and field studies have emphasized the impact of disturbance in the dynamics and diversity of sessile organism communities. This view is best reflected by the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH), which states that a maximum of diversity is found in ecosystems or communities experiencing intermediate disturbance regimes or at an intermediate stage of development since the last major disturbance event. Although theoretical models based on competitive interactions tend to validate this hypothesis, a recent meta-analysis of field experiments revealed that the mono-modal relationship between disturbance and diversity might not be a general pattern. In this article, we investigate the relationship between disturbance and diversity through the study of patch models, combining two types of competitive interactions: with or without competitive hierarchy, with two mechanisms influencing colonization: negative frequency dependence in colonization rates and immigration. These combinations led to various disturbancediversity patterns. In the model without competitive hierarchy (founder effect model), a decreasing relationship appeared to be the rule as mentioned in previous studies. In the model with competitive hierarchy, the IDH pattern was obtained for low frequency dependence and low immigration. Nevertheless, high negative frequency dependence in colonization rates led to a decreasing relationship between disturbance and diversity. In contrast, high immigration led to an increasing relationship. The coexistence window (the range of disturbance intensity allowing coexistence) was the widest for intermediate immigration rates. For random species assemblages, patterns with multiple peaks were also possible. These results highlight the fact that the mono-modal IDH pattern should not be considered a rule. Competition and colonization mechanisms have a profound impact on the relationship between disturbance and diversity",,Article de revue,Sciences de l'environnement,Journal of Theoretical Biology,'Elsevier BV'

Hence, if the LRT breaks down, the breakdown occurs in the region of intermediate times. We also show that, for a given system, if any macroscopic linear response exists, it must coincide with Kubo LRT; thus, if a generic system responds nonlinearly to an external perturbation, this nonlinear response is observable only in an intermediate-time range.

The presence of resonances in large Poincaré systems causes a breakdown of the conventional perturbation methods analytic in the coupling parameter. These difficulties are manifestations of general limitations to computability for unstable dynamical systems. However, a natural ordering of the dynamical states leads to a well-defined prescription for the regularization of the propagators which lifts the divergence and gives rise to an extension of the eigenvalue problem to the complex plane. The extension acquires meaning in suitable rigged Hilbert spaces which are constructed explicitly for the Friedrichs model. We show that the unitary evolution group, when extended, splits into two semigroups, one decaying in the future and the other in the past.

Akay",2007,"This paper discusses a class of unexpected irreversible phenomena that can develop in linear conservative systems and provides a theoretical foundation that explains the underlying principles. Recent studies have shown that energy can be introduced to a linear system with near irreversibility, or energy within a system can migrate to a subsystem nearly irreversibly, even in the absence of dissipation, provided that the system has a particular natural frequency distribution. The present work introduces a general theory that provides a mathematical foundation and a physical explanation for the near irreversibility phenomena observed and reported in previous publications. Inspired by the properties of probability distribution functions, the general formulation developed here is based on particular properties of harmonic series, which form the-common basis of linear dynamic system models. The results demonstrate the existence of a special class of linear nondissipative dynamic systems that exhibit nearly irreversible energy exchange and possess a decaying impulse response. In addition to uncovering a new class of dynamic system properties, the results have far-reaching implications in engineering applications where classical vibration damping or absorption techniques may not be effective. Furthermore, the results also support the notion of nearly irreversible energy transfer in conservative linear systems, which until now has been a concept associated exclusively with nonlinear systerns.(c) 2007 Acoustical Society of America",,info:eu-repo/semantics/article,,,'Acoustical Society of America (ASA)'

Belan, Phys. Fluids 15, 1897  2003  . The multiscaling is carried out to explicitly account for the effects associated to the lateral momentum dynamics at a given Reynolds number. These effects are an important feature of the base flow and are included in the perturbative equation as well as in the associated modulation equation. At the first order in the multiscaling, the disturbance is locally tuned to the property of the instability, as can be seen in the zero-order theory  near-parallel parametric Orr-Sommerfeld treatment . This leads to a synthetic analysis of the nonparallel correction of the instability characteristics. The system is, in fact, considered to be locally perturbed by waves with a wave number that varies along the intermediate wake and which is equal to the wave number of the dominant saddle point of the zero order dispersion relation, taken at different Reynolds numbers. In this study, the Reynolds number is thus the only parameter. It is shown that the corrections to the frequency, and to the temporal and spatial growth rates are remarkable in the first part of the intermediate wake and lead to absolute instability  in regions that extend to about ten body scales. The correction increases with the Reynolds number and agrees with data from laboratory and numerical experiments in literature.

Such an∗E-mail: floriani@cpt.univ.mrs.fr†The Alexander von Humboldt Fellow, volchenk@physik.uni-bielefeld.de1intermittent behavior is observed in a broad class of different systems in physics and nonlineardynamics. Depending on its origin, the intermittent behavior either corresponds to the classifi-cation proposed by Pomeau-Manneville [1] (the I-III types intermittency) or shows the featurescharacteristic of crisis-induced intermittency [2]. In both cases, the parameters of the mod-els are static. Another example of intermittent behavior, called on-off intermittency, has beenintroduced in [3] and then observed numerically and experimentally [4]-[14]. The mechanismfor this type of intermittency relies on a random forcing of a bifurcation parameter through abifurcation point.The ergodic properties of a system at a threshold of instability can be partially characterizedby the distribution of the quiescent times (the durations of laminar phases) P (t). Indeed, acomplete characterization of the statistical properties of the system would imply the knowledgeof residence times distribution in all the regions of phase space and not only in the laminarregions. However, the former is the first important statistical indicator of such a dynamics andthis is the reason why we focus on the quiescent times distribution in the present study.Depending on the particular type of intermittency exhibited by the system, the distributionP (t) can display either an exponential or an inverse power law tail of exponent γ. In particular,the power law statistics of the quiescent times distribution is claimed to be typical for the systemsshowing the on-off type intermittency, and the value of exponent γ depends in general on thenonlinearity characteristic of the dynamical system considered [13]. For example, in experimentson ion-acoustic instabilities in a laboratory plasma [14], due to nonlinear effects, the exponentof the power law depends on the value of a control parameter.In the present paper, we investigate the effect produced on the statistics of laminar phases by2the stochastic fluctuations of a system state variable (a bifurcation parameter) near the fluctu-ating threshold of instability (a bifurcation point). In our study, we do not refer to any definitephysical system displaying an intermittent behavior. For the toy model which we introduce,the bifurcation parameter and the bifurcation point are considered as random independent vari-ables. It is supposed that intermittency takes place in the system, when the process crosses thethreshold value.The control parameter of the system is the number η ∈ [0, 1], which represents a relative fre-quency of fluctuation of the threshold value: varying the parameter η amounts to modifying therelation between the characteristic time scales of the threshold variable and of the state variable.At η = 0 (when the state and the threshold varible have the same time scale) the statistics oflaminar phases is exponential, while at η = 1 (the limiting case of quenched threshold) it can bepower law; for the intermediate values 0 < η < 1, the statistics is mixed, becoming exponentialfor sufficiently large times.In general, the statistics of laminar phases depends on the statistics of the random systemstate variable and threshold. We believe that the investigation of such a simple model couldshed light on the dynamical origin of intermittent behavior occurring in more complex physicalsystems near a bifurcation point.Let us notice that this model reproduces, in an extremely simplified manner, certain featuresof the dynamics of a weakly chaotic Hamiltonian system, with islands of stability in the phasespace. The orbit of such a system (described by our state variable) typically stays for long timesin the vicinity of a stability island until the moment when it crosses the separatrix (describedby our threshold variable): the orbit then rapidly moves to other regions of phase space, until3it reaches the neighborhood of another island, and the process starts again [15]. The evolutionof the system is a succession of laminar phases, where diffusion dominates, and of flights; animportant indicator of the statistical properties of the system is precisely the distribution of exittimes from the neighborhood of an island of stability (corresponding to our P (t)).The outline of the paper is as follows. In Sec. 2, we describe the model we introduce. InSec. 3, we compute the distribution of residence times below the threshold with a generatingfunctions approach. In many cases, the resulting distribution can be found explicitly. In Sec. 4,we consider the case of uniform statistics of the system state variable and threshold. Section 5is devoted to conclusions.2 Description of the modelLet us suppose that the state of a system can be characterized by a real number x ∈ [0, 1].Another real number y ∈ [0, 1] plays the role of a threshold of stability. The system is stable aslong as x < y and exhibits a sudden transition to the irregular state otherwise (x ≥ y).We consider x as a random variable distributed with respect to some given probabilitydistribution function P{x < u} = F (u). In an analogous way, the value of the threshold y isalso a random variable distributed over the interval [0, 1] with respect to some other probabilitydistribution function (pdf) P{y < u} = G(u). In general, F and G are two arbitrary left-continuous increasing functions satisfying the normalization conditions F (0) = G(0) = 0, F (1) =G(1) = 1.Given a fixed real number η ∈ [0, 1], we define a discrete time random process in the followingway. At time t = 0, the variable x is chosen with respect to pdf F , and y is chosen with respect4to pdf G. If x < y, the process continues and goes to time t = 1. At time t ≥ 1, the followingevents happen:i) with probability η, the random variable x is chosen with pdf F but the threshold y keepsthe value it had at time t− 1. Otherwise,ii) with probability 1− η, the random variable x is chosen with pdf F , and the threshold yis chosen with pdf G.If x ≥ y, the process ends; if x < y, the process continues and goes to time t+ 1.Eventually, at some time step t, when the state variable x exceeds the threshold value y,the process stops, the system destabilizes, and the integer value t = T acquired in this randomprocess limits the duration of the laminar phase. The system then regains the stable state, whenx < y, and the process starts again.While studying the above model, we are interested in the distribution of the duration oflaminar phases Pη(T ;F,G) provided the probability distributions F and G are given and thecontrol parameter η is fixed.Even if in our model the state variable x is treated as a random variable, what is reallyimportant in what follows is the corresponding pdf F . It would be in fact possible to treat x asa deterministic dynamical variable defined by the iterated images of a map of the interval [0, 1].In this case we would assume the existence of an invariant ergodic (Bernoulli) measure dF , forwhich x is a generic orbit.It is also to be noticed that the model proposed resembles closely to the coherent-noisemodels [16]-[17] discussed in connection with a standard sandpile model [18] in self-organizedcriticality, where the statistics of avalanche sizes and durations take power law forms. No exact5analytical results concerning the coherent-noise models have been obtained so far. The modelwe propose has not been discussed in the literature before and, in principle, is much simplerthan those discussed in [16]-[17], since it does not involve any spatial dynamics typical of suchextended systems with quenched memory as the original sandpile models.3 Distribution of residence times below the thresholdWe are interested in the probability Pη(T ;F,G) that the random process introduced inthe previous section ends precisely at time T with a crossing of the threshold, provided thedistributions F and G are given and η is fixed. We shall denote Pη(T ;F,G) simply as P (T ). Astraightforward computation shows directly from the definitions of Sec. 2 thatP (0) =∫ 10dG(y) (1− F (y)) .For T ≥ 1, the system can either stay below the threshold in the laminar state ( a ”survival”)(S) or cross the threshold to a burst state (a ”death”) (D). Both events can take place either inthe ”correlated” way (with probability η; see i) in Sec. 2) (we denote them Sc and Dc), or inthe ”uncorrelated” way (with probability 1 − η; see ii) in Sec. 2) (Su and Du). For T = 1, wehave for example:P (1) = P [SDc] + P [SDu]=∫ 10dG(y)F (y) η (1− F (y))+∫ 10dG(y)F (y) (1− η)∫ 10dG(z) (1− F (z)) == ηB(1) + (1− η)A(1)B(0) .6Similarly,P (2) = η2B(2) + η(1− η)A(1)B(1) + η(1− η)A(2)B(0) + (1− η)2A(1)2B(0) ,where we define, for n = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,A(n) =∫ 10dG(y)F (y)n , (1)andB(n) =∫ 10dG(y)F (y)n (1− F (y)) = A(n)−A(n+ 1) . (2)The general formula for P (T ), for all T ≥ 3, is given in Appendix A.It is useful to introduce the generating function of P (T ):Pˆ (s) =∞∑T=0sTP (T )The generating property of the function Pˆ (s) is such thatP (T ) =1T !dT Pˆ (s)dsT∣∣∣∣∣s=0. (3)Defining the following auxiliary functionsp(l) = ηlA(l + 1) , for l ≥ 1 , p(0) = 0 ,q(l) = (1− η)lA(1)l−1 , for l ≥ 1 , q(0) = 0 ,r(l) = ηl [ηB(l + 1) + (1− η)A(l + 1)B(0)] , for l ≥ 1, r(0) = 0 ,ρ = ηB(1) + (1− η)A(1)B(0) , (4)we findPˆ (s) = B(0) + ρs+s1− pˆ(s)qˆ(s)[rˆ(s) + ρpˆ(s)qˆ(s) + ρA(1)qˆ(s) +A(1)qˆ(s)rˆ(s)] , (5)7where pˆ(s), qˆ(s), rˆ(s) are the generating functions of p(l), q(l), r(l), respectively.In the marginal cases η = 0 and η = 1, the probability P (T ) can be readily calculated. Forη = 0, equations (4), (5) givePˆη=0(s) =B(0)1− sA(1). (6)Applying the inverse formula (3) to equation (6), one getsPη=0(T ) = A(1)TB(0) =[∫ 10dG(y)F (y)]T ∫ 10dG(y) (1− F (y)) .Therefore, in this case, for any choice of the pdf F and G, the probability P (T ) decays expo-nentially.For η = 1, equations (4), (5) yieldPˆη=1(s) = Bˆ(s) ,so that,Pη=1(T ) = B(T ) =∫ 10dG(y)F (y)T (1− F (y)) . (7)3.1 Some examples of decay in the correlated case η = 1We have just seen that, in the uncorrelated case η = 0, the probability P (T ) decays exponentiallyfor any choice of the pdf’s F and G.In the correlated case η = 1, many different types of behavior are possible, depending onthe form of F and G. We will examine an important class of pdf’s, for which Pη=1(T ) can beexplicitly computed from equation (7). We will take F and G absolutely continuous with respect8to the Lebesgue measure, withdF (u) = (1 + α) uα du , α > −1 ,dG(u) = (1 + β)(1− u)β du , β > −1 .Here we recognize the family of invariant measures of a map of the interval with a fixed neutralpoint [20].Equation (7) gives in this case:Pη=1(T ) =Γ(2 + β) Γ(1 + T (1 + α))Γ(2 + β + T (1 + α))−Γ(2 + β) Γ(1 + (T + 1)(1 + α))Γ(2 + β + (T + 1)(1 + α)).Using Stirling’s approximation, we get for T ≫ 1:Pη=1(T ) =(1 + β) Γ(2 + β) (1 + α)−1−βT 2+β(1 + 0(1T)). (8)For different values of β, the exponent of the threshold distribution, we get all possible(normalizable) power law decays of Pη=1(T ). Notice that the exponent (−2− β) characterizingthe decay of Pη=1(T ) is independent of the distribution F of the state variable.We were not able to prove that the asymptotic decay of Pη=1(T ) is algebraic for any choiceof the distributions F and G; nevertheless, we have not found any counterexample contradictingthis conjecture. Let us consider in particular the case of F uniform (the results of this sectionsuggest in fact that what determines the decay of P (T ) is mostly the threshold pdf G): Pη=1(T )is then a particular case of a Riemann-Liouville integral, and we did not find any case of nonalgebraic decay for large T in the tables [19].93.2 Upper and lower bounds for P (T ) for any ηWe now compute bounds for P (T ), valid for any η and any T ≥ 3, starting from its expressiongiven in Appendix A.We will use the fact thatA(1)n ≤ A(n) ≤ A(1) and 0 ≤ B(n) ≤ A(1) , n = 1, 2, ... .The upper bound for A(n) is trivial, since 0 ≤ F (y) ≤ 1 for any y ∈ [0, 1]. The lower bound isa consequence of Jensen’s inequality, and of the fact that the function x :→ xn is convex on theinterval ]0, 1[ for any integer n.We now replace these bounds for A(n) and B(n) in equations (17) to (20), and the resultingexpressions in all the terms of the sum (16), except the one corresponding to the index n = 0 inPI(T ). (This term, which corresponds to a sequence of correlated survivals, has to be treatedseparately, in order not to lose information on the case η = 1). Labeling by the index k thenumber of uncorrelated survivals in the sequence of events considered in the sum (16), we getPη(T ) ≤[ηTB(T ) + ηT−1(1− η)A(T )B(0)]+ [ηA(1) + (1− η)A(1)B(0)]T−1∑k=1γT−1k [(1− η)A(1)]k ηT−1−k ,andPη(T ) ≥[ηTB(T ) + ηT−1(1− η)A(T )B(0)]+ (1− η)A(1)B(0)T−1∑k=1γT−1k [(1− η)A(1)]k [ηA(1)]T−1−k ,where γT−1k represents the number of sequences of T −1 events c, u (c = correlated survival, u =10uncorrelated survival) containing a number k of events u, so that,γT−1k =T − 1k .This implies the upper boundPη(T ) ≤ ηTB(T ) + (1− η)A(1)B(0) [η + (1− η)A(1)]T−1 (9)+ ηA(1){[η + (1− η)A(1)]T−1 − ηT−1},and the lower boundPη(T ) ≥ ηTB(T ) + (1− η)A(1)TB(0) (10)= ηTPη=1(T ) + (1− η)Pη=0(T ) .We thus see that, for any 0 ≤ η < 1, the decay of distribution P (T ) is bounded by ex-ponentials. Furthermore, the bounds (9) and (10) are exact in the marginal cases η = 0 andη = 1.3.3 Behavior of P (T ) for intermediate timesWe have seen in section 3.1 that it exists a class of pdf’s for which Pη(T ) decays like a powerlaw when η = 1. In section 3.2, we show that for any η 6= 1 the asymptotic decay of Pη(T ) isexponential. We now make some remarks about the behavior of Pη(T ) for η close to 1.The first thing to be noticed is that, for T fixed, Pη(T ) is a continuous function of η, sinceit is a finite sum of continuous functions (see Appendix A). The results of section 3.2 imply ofcourse that the continuity cannot be uniform in T .11This means that, for any fixed interval of times [T−, T+], with T− in the range of validity ofthe power law asymptotics (8) of P1(T ), Pη(T ) will be arbitrarily close to the same power lawfor η sufficiently close to 1.For times T ≫ T+, the decay becomes exponential. We shall see in the next section thatfor the case of uniform densities, it is possible to estimate the value of the crossover time to theexponential behavior as a function of η.4 Distribution of quiescent times for the case of uniform densi-tiesIn this section, we consider the distribution of quiescent times for the special case of uniformdensities dF (u) = dG(u) = du for all u ∈ [0, 1] and for any η ∈ [0, 1]. In this case, simpler andexplicit expressions can be given for Pˆ (s) and P (T ).After some tedious but trivial computation, we get from equation (5):Pˆ (s) =11 + (1− η)γ(s)[1 + γ(s)s− ηγ(s)], (11)where γ(s) is defined byγ(s) =ln(1− ηs)ηs.The asymptotic behavior of P (T ) is determined by the singularity of the generating functionPˆ (s) that is closest to the origin.For η = 0, the generating function Pˆ (s) = (2 − s)−1 has a simple pole, and therefore P (T )decays exponentially, which agrees with the result of the previous section. In Figure 1, we havepresented the distribution of quiescent times P (T ) in log-linear scale for η = 0.12For the intermediate values 0 < η < 1, the generating function Pˆ (s) has two singularities.One pole, s = s0, corresponds to the vanishing denominator 1 + (1 − η)γ(s), where s0 = s0(η)is the unique nontrivial solution of the equation− ln(1− ηs) = sη1− η. (12)Another singularity, s = s1 = η−1, corresponds to the vanishing argument of the logarithm. Itis easy to see that 1 < s0 < s1, so that the dominant singularity of Pˆ (s) is of polar type, andthe corresponding decay of P (T ) is exponential, with rate ln(s0(η)), for times much larger thanthe crossover time Tc(η) ∼ ln(s0(η))−1.The results of section 3.2 about the upper bound for the distribution P (T ) allow to be moreprecise about this decay rate. Equation (9) implies in particular (since B(T ) ≤ A(1)) thatP (T ) ≤ [ηA(1) + (1− η)A(1)B(0)] [η + (1− η)A(1)]T−1 ,which in the case of uniform densities givesP (T ) ≤12(1 + η2)T.We have then1s1= η <1s0≤1 + η2,and we see that the rate ln(s0(η)) vanishes like 1− η as η tends to 1.When η tends to one, the two singularities s0 and s1 merge. More precisely, we havePˆη=1(s) =s+ (1− s) ln(1− s)s2. (13)13The corresponding dominant term in (13) is of order O(T−2) [21]. This obviously agrees withthe exact result one can get from equation (7), with dF (u) = dG(u) = du :Pη=1(T ) =1(T + 1)(T + 2). (14)In Figure 2, we have drawn the distribution of quiescent times Pη=1(T ) that exhibits the power-law decay, with the slope γ = −2.In the case of uniform densities, it is possible to get an expression of P (T ) for all times,and for any value of η, by applying the inversion formula (3) to equation (11). We have (seeAppendix B):P (T ) =ηT(T + 1)(T + 2)+T∑k=1ηT(T − k + 1)(T − k + 2) kk∑m=1(1− ηη)mc(m, k) , (15)where c(m, k) is defined byc(m, k) = m!∑l1+l2+···+lm = kli≥1l1 l2 · · · lm−1 lm(l1 + 1) (k − l1) (l2 + 1) (k − l1 − l2) · · · (lm−1 + 1) (k − l1 − l2 − · · · − lm−1) (lm + 1).When η 6= 0, there is an alternative way of writing the previous expression:P (T ) =ηT(T + 1)(T + 2)+T∑k=1ηT+1(T − k + 1)(T − k + 2)∞∑l=1(1− η)l b(l, k) ,where b(l, k) is defined by14b(l, k) =∑i1+i2+···+il = kij≥01(i1 + 1) (i2 + 1) · · · (il−1 + 1) (il + 1).In Figure 3, we have plotted the distribution of quiescent times Pη(T ) for the intermediatevalues η = 0.5, η = 0.7, η = 0.9, together with the analytical result (15).Notice that in Figures 1 and 3 (where η 6= 1), we only plot distributions P (T ) up to relativelyshort quiescent times (T = 16, T = 25), since these times are already bigger than the crossovertime Tc(η) ∼ 1/ ln(s0) to the exponential decay exp (− ln(s0)T ) (s0 defined by equation (12)).For much longer times, very few survivals are observed, and the statistics gets worse. Of course,Tc(η) grows as the parameter η tends to 1, so that we have good statistics for longer and longertimes (in Figure 2, for η = 1, the plot is for quiescent times 20 ≤ T ≤ 2000).5 Discussion and ConclusionIn this paper, we have presented a model for a system at a threshold of instability. Weassumed that the system loses stability when the parameter characterizing its state becomeslarger than a threshold value. We have treated both the state parameter x and the valueof threshold y as random variables distributed over the unit interval with respect to differentdistribution laws F and G respectively. The natural control parameter in our model is theprobability η, which represents a relative frequency of threshold changes such that if η = 1, thethreshold value y does not change during a laminar phase. In the opposite case, if η = 0, at eachtime step, a new threshold value is taken with respect to the probability distribution function G.15Varying η ∈ [0, 1], provided the distributions F and G are given, one can control the statisticsof switching events (i.e. when the state parameter passes through the stability threshold).For many distributions F and G, the model can be solved analytically. In particular, weexhibit a class of threshold pdf’s that allow to obtain any possible (normalizable) power lawdecay of the distribution of laminar phases, when η = 1. Furthermore, we show that for anychoice of the distributions F and G the distribution of laminar phases P (T ) decays exponen-tially at η = 0, and that P (T ) is bounded above by a decresing exponential function of rate[η + (1− η)∫ 10 dG(y)F (y)]for any 0 < η < 1.We have then studied the model for the special case of uniform densities dF (u) = dG(u) = du.In this case the distribution of laminar phases decays as T−2 at η = 1 . For the intermediatevalues of η, the decay is mixed: even if the asymptotic behavior is exponential, when η is closeto 1 the exponential regime is reached only for very large time lengths of order (1− η)−1, whilefor intermediate but large times, the decay is polynomial.A natural question arising in this context is the relationship between the ergodic invariantsthat quantify the dynamics of deterministic systems, for example the Lyapunov exponents,and the scaling laws studied in our paper. The corresponding question for models of self-organised criticality is certainly also pertinent since in that case a relation is known betweenthe Lyapunov spectrum and the transport properties [22]. In our case, however, because of thedynamical character not only of the state variable but also of the threshold, some extension ofthe definition of the invariants would be needed, which is beyond the scope of the present paper.166 AcknowledgementsThis work has been performed in connection with the international research project ”TheSciences of Complexity: From Mathematics to Technology to a Sustainable World”, Zentrum fu¨rInterdisziplina¨re Forschung (ZIF), Universita¨t Bielefeld (Germany).

The resulting phenomena thus serve as “early warning signals” for shifts such as population collapse. In this chapter, we review the basic(qualitative) theory of such systems. We then illustrate the main ideas with a series of models that both represent fundamental ecological ideas (e.g. density-dependence) and are amenable to mathematical analysis.

Kinematic modelling studies have suggested that slab breakoff can account for this post-collisional magmatism through the formation of a slab window and subsequent heating of the overriding plate and decompression melting of upwelling asthenosphere, particularly if breakoff occurs at depths shallower than the overriding plate.To constrain the nature of any melting and the geodynamic conditions required, we numerically model the collision of two continental plates following a period of oceanic subduction. A thermodynamic database is used to determine the (de)hydration reactions and occurrence of melt throughout this process. We investigate melting conditions within a parameter space designed to generate a wide range of breakoff depths, timings and collisional styles.Under most circumstances, slab breakoff occurs deeper than the depth extent of the overriding plate; too deep to generate any decompressional melting of dry upwelling asthenosphere or thermal perturbation within the overriding plate. Even if slab breakoff is very shallow, the hot mantle inflow into the slab window is not sustained long enough to sufficiently heat the hydrated overriding plate to cause significant magmatism. Instead, for relatively fast, shallow breakoff we observe melting of asthenosphere above the detached slab through the release of water from the tip of the heating detached slab. Melting of the subducted continental crust during necking and breakoff is a more common feature and may be a more reliable indicator of the occurrence of breakoff. We suggest that magmatism from slab breakoff alone is unable to explain several of the characteristics of post-collisional magmatism, and that additional geodynamical processes need to be considered when interpreting magmatic observations",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/article, Journal articles","subduction, slab breakoff, magmatism, continental collision, numerical modelling, [SDU.STU.PE]Sciences of the Universe [physics]/Earth Sciences/Petrography",,'Elsevier BV'

Such a so-called invasional meltdown could be mediated by differences in soil-legacy effects between alien and native plants. Whether such legacy effects might depend on the diversity of the invaded community has not been explored to date. Here, we conducted a two-phase plant-soil feedback experiment. In a soil-conditioning phase, we grew five alien and five native species as invaders in 21 communities of one, two or four species. In the subsequent test phase, we grew five alien and five native species on the conditioned soils. We found that growth of these test species was negatively affected by soils conditioned by both a community and an invader, and particularly if the previous invader was a conspecific (i.e. negative plant-soil feedback). Alien test species suffered less from soil-legacy effects of previous allospecific alien invaders than from the legacy effects of previous native invaders. However, this effect decreased when the soil had been co-conditioned by a multispecies community. Our findings suggest that plant-soil feedback-mediated invasional meltdown may depend on community diversity and therefore provide some evidence that diverse communities could increase resistance against subsequent alien invasions.publishe",,info:eu-repo/semantics/article,"alien species, belowground,coexistence, diversity–invasibility, nativeinvader, soil legacy, subsequent invasion, info:eu-repo/classification/ddc/570",,'Wiley'
invasional meltdown hypothesis,153186251,The role of melt induces lithospheric weakening on the dynamics of continental rifting,,"Schmeling, Harro, Fuchs, Lukas, Wallner, Herbert",2010,"<p>Active or passive continental rifting is accompanied by lithospheric weakening and thinning, ascent of asthenosphereand decompressional melting. Melt percolates through the partially molten source region, accumulatesbeneath its top and is extracted. After extraction it may either be extruded at the surface or intruded at any depthbetween the top of the melting zone and the surface. In case of intrusion the release of latent and internal heat heatsup the lithosphere and weakens it. In a feed back mechanism this weakening may assist rifting and melt production.Two-dimensional numerical extension models of the continental lithosphere-asthenosphere system are carriedout based on Eulerian visco-plastic formulation. The conservation equations of mass, momentum and energy aresolved for a multi-component (crust-mantle) two-phase (melt-matrix) system. Temperature-, pressure-, and stressdependentrheology is used based on laboratory data for granite, pyroxenite and olivine, representing the uppercrust, lower crust, and mantle, respectively. Rifting is modelled by externally applying a constant rate of extension.Model series are carried out in which the emplacement depth of extracted melts is varied between the top of themelting zone and the surface. It is found that in comparison with cases without melt intrusions these lithosphericregions may be heated by up to several 100 K, which leads to viscous weakening of one order of magnitude ormore. Consequently, in a feed back mechanism rifting is dynamically enforced, leading to a significant increase ofrift induced melt generation.</p",,"Article in journal, info:eu-repo/semantics/article, text","Geosciences, Multidisciplinary, Multidisciplinär geovetenskap",,

Traditionally, melt quantities are estimated by semi-analytical models or parameterized results from hydrocode simulations that calculate impact-induced melt. These so-called scaling laws roughly estimate the melt volume using basic impactor and target properties, which are assumed constant. The latter is valid for homogenous targets which usually applies for relatively small impact events, but it becomes more problematic if the impact significantly affects deeper target regions where target properties substantially change. Furthermore, previous studies indicate that plastic work and decompression melting can significantly contribute to the total melt production, which is usually not considered by scaling laws.    We aim at developing more accurate melt predictions that include a comprehensive representation of target and projectile interdependencies during large collisions throughout the history of the solar system. To this end, we run numerical models of impact events using the iSALE shock physics code, which we have extended with a massless Lagrangian tracer-based method to account for the target's thermal profile, decompression melting and plastic work. As a general representation of bodies that exist or have existed in the solar system, we consider a set of generic models of terrestrial planets and planetesimals. For these target bodies we calculate the radial thermal structure by employing parameterized thermal evolution models that account for partial melting of the mantle and crustal growth. The resulting interior structure of the target body at different times and evolution stages is then used as the initial condition for the impact simulations",,"Konferenzbeitrag, NonPeerReviewed",Planetenphysik,,

Impact-induced melting of crustal and mantle materials leads to the formation of local and regional melt ponds, and the cumulative effects of the impact flux could result in widespread melting of the crust. To quantify impact-melt production, its provenance and final distribution as a function of impact conditions, we carried out a systematic parameter study using the iSALE shock physics code. In contrast to simplified scaling laws for estimating the amount of melt generated by shock compression, we take the planet's thermal state at the time of impact into account. In addition, we consider decompression melting as a consequence of lithostatic uplift of initially deep-seated material. We find that the geothermal profile has a strong effect on melt production, and that melt volumes are significantly increased by up to a factor of seven in comparison to existing analytical estimates. Enhanced melting occurs at impactor sizes (and velocities) that deposit most of their energy at a depth close to the base of the lithosphere. Impactors larger than 10 km penetrate through the lithosphere and can generate a significant amount of melt by decompression due to lithostatic uplift, which can make up to 40% of the total melt volume. In some cases, the total melt volume exceeds the volume of the transient (and final) crater and the surface expression of these collisions may resemble large igneous provinces rather than typical craters",,"Zeitschriftenbeitrag, PeerReviewed",Planetenphysik,,Elsevier

Thermo-mechanical effects of partial melting were implemented as (1) a viscosity decrease as a determined rheologically critical melt percentage was reached (here 0.1), (2) a change in effective heat capacity and adiabatic heating/cooling accounting for a latent heat term in the heat equation. Among the 3 tested reactions, only H2O-fluid-saturated partial melting drastically modifies the collision dynamics from the non-melting reference model holding all other parameters constant. A substantially low general viscosity truncation (here 1017 Pa s) is needed to properly resolve the effect of partial melting on deep collision processes. Low temperature melting indeed induces the development of a low viscosity buoyant plume prior to slab detachment, where migmatites exhume from UHP conditions at rates and with pressure–temperature paths similar to the natural values acknowledged for the Norwegian Caledonides. High temperature melting has no drastic influence on early collision dynamics. While positive buoyancy remains the first order driver for the exhumation of buried continental rocks, exhumation initiates in these cases with eduction subsequent to slab detachment. Melting and formation of a migmatite plume can later occur along decompression path while continental crust undergoes thermal reequilibration at temperatures above 900 °C. Some of the partially molten material can also relaminate in the overriding plate rather than exhume within the collision zone. Even if minor in terms of amount of magma produced, H2O-fluid-saturated partial melting at UHP conditions could therefore have a dramatic rheological effect and actually limits continental rocks subduction and facilitates their exhumation",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/article, Journal articles","ultrahigh pressure metamorphism, continental subduction, partial melting, [SDU.STU.GP]Sciences of the Universe [physics]/Earth Sciences/Geophysics [physics.geo-ph]",,'Elsevier BV'

Continental collisions are preceded by subduction of dense oceanic lithosphere, and followed by attempted subduction of buoyant continental lithosphere. This situation of opposing buoyancy forces leads to extensional deformation in the subducted slab. A narrow rifting mode of deformation will result if there is strain localization. Slab breakoff results.    We have assessed the plausiblity of this process by quantitatively evaluating an upper bound for the strength of the lithosphere, and have compared it with the change in buoyancy force during continental sbduction. Whether breakoff will occur, and the depth at which it will occur, is a strong function of temperature and hence the subduction velocity. For a subduction velocity of 1 cm/yr breakoff could occur at depths of between 50 and 120 km, while at higher velocities it is still likely to occur, but at deeper depths.    As a result of the rifting during breakoff, the asthenosphere upwells into the narrow rift, and following breakoff it impinges on the mechanical lithosphere of the overriding plate. The resulting conducted thermal perturbation leads to melting of the metasomatised overriding mantle lithosphere, producing basaltic magmatism that leads to granitic magmatism in the crust. Dry asthenospheric mantle will melt only if breakoff occurs at a depth shallower than ca. 50 km. Breakoff removes the force at the downdip side of the continental crust, while the enhanced heating leads to a reduction of the strength of the underlying crust. Both effects facilitate the freeing of buoyant crustal sheets which can then rise towards the surface, leading to the rapid exhumation of eclogite facies continental crust. The cessation of subduction and replacement of the cold oceanic lithosphere by asthenosphere leads to rapid uplift of the orogen.    We have tested the variety of predicted expressions of slab breakoff in the geological record of the Alps, the Aegean Islands, and the Dabie Shan. A comparison of the various belts highlights (1) that the magmatism and metamorphism are found near the suture and the centre of the orogen, demonstrating the general steepening of suture during collision, (2) that a vague inverse correlation exists between maximum depth of metamorphism and volume of syn-orogenic magmatism, and (3) that the melts can be emplaced in both compressive and extensional environments. We suggest that slab breakoff is an important step in the evolution of many orogenic belts, and it allows an explanation for the combined presence in collisional orogens of magmatism with a mantle parentage and ultra-high-pressure metamorphics",,QE,QE,,Elsevier

Foulger,2007,"The Plate Tectonic Processes, or “Plate ” model for the genesis of melting anomalies (“hot spots”) attributes them to shallow-sourced phenomena related to plate tectonics. It postulates that volcanism occurs where the lithosphere is in extension, and that the volume of melt produced is related primarily to the fertility of the source material tapped.

Ocean-island-basalt-like geochemistry is evidence for source fertility at productive melting anomalies. Plate tectonics involves a rich diversity of processes, and as a result the Plate model is in harmony with many characteristics of the global melting-anomaly constellation that have tended to be underemphasized. The melting anomalies that have been classified as “hot spots ” and “hot spot tracks ” exhibit extreme variability.

Tackley",2008,"[1] In a companion paper, numerical models reveal that buoyant melting instabilities can occur beneath extending lithosphere for a sufficiently small mantle viscosity, extension rate, and rate of melt percolation. However, in some cases, instabilities do not develop during extension but only occur after extension slows or stops. These results are suggestive of a critical behavior in the onset of these kinds of instabilities and motivate a linear analysis to study the onset of instability in a partially melting, passively upwelling plane layer of mantle beneath extending lithosphere. The model we employ includes the effects of buoyancy arising from thermal expansion, the presence of a retained fraction of partial melt, and depletion of the solid by melt extraction. We find a critical behavior in the onset of instability controlled by melt retention buoyancy that is characterized by a ‘‘Rayleigh’ ’ number M, such that M must exceed some critical value Mcrit which depends on the efficiency of Stokes rise of a partially molten body relative to the rate of background percolation. Comparison of this theory to the numerical results in the companion paper yields a close quantitative agreement. We also find that solid depletion buoyancy can either stabilize or destabilize a partially melting layer, depending upon both the distribution of preexisting depletion and the magnitude of density changes with depth. This theory is compared with previous studies of buoyant melting instabilities beneath mid-ocean ridges where similar behavior was reported, and it suggests that the stability of passively upwelling, partially melting mantle underlying both narrow and wide rift settings is controlled by similar processes",,text,,,

The considered time window is that of catastrophic acceleration, starting at incipient failure and ending when the acquired displacement and velocity are such that the sliding material begins to break up into pieces. The model accounts for temperature rise in the slip zone due to the heat produced by friction, leading to water expansion, thermoplastic collapse of the soil skeleton, and subsequent increase of pore water pressure. The model incorporates the processes of heat production and diffusion, pore pressure generation and diffusion, and an advanced constitutive law for the thermo-mechanical behavior of soil. An analysis of the Vajont landslide is presented as an example. A sensitivity analysis shows that friction softening is the mechanism most affecting the timescale of the final collapse of a slide, but also that the mechanism of thermal pressurization alone can cause a comparably catastrophic dynamic evolution.

The causes of the event have been widely debated, with the two main theories being a large asteroid impact or volcanism. While some scientists disagree, the most popular and agreed upon theory is that a large asteroid impacted Earth 65 million years ago, creating a toxic dust cloud that filled the atmosphere, and resulted in the eventual extinction of most of the dinosaurs. This theory was first brought to life by Luis Alvarez, his son Walter, and their team based on their findings of large spikes of the rare element iridium in different locations around the world at the K-Pg boundary (formerly known as the K-T boundary).

Keywords: extinction, impact theory, Deccan volcanism, dinosaur extinction   CONFLICTING THEORIES  3 Conflicting Theories: Impact and Volcanism There have been five major mass extinctions in Earth’s history, but none of them are more talked about than the K-T (Cretaceous-Tertiary) extinction. Also known as the extinction of the dinosaurs, the event happened 65 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period and beginning of the formerly named Tertiary period, now renamed the Paleogene period (Lydon, 2016, para. 2). Because of this, it is now often referred to as the K-Pg extinction. While the events “claim to fame” is the extinction of the dinosaurs, not much is ever made of the massive loss of plant life that was suffered, especially planktic foraminifera, which suffered the biggest loss of life compared to any other organism (Keller, Sahni, & Bajpai, 2009, p. 724). Over time, scientists have had many different theories about what caused the extinction event but the main two are a large asteroid impact and volcanism. To this day the most accepted theory is that of the asteroid impact, but it is still debated by many.  Impact Theory The well-known and widely agreed upon theory is that a large asteroid crashed into the earth and put in motion the chain of events that caused the mass extinction. This conclusion was birthed when Nobel prize winner Luis Alvarez, his son Walter, and some coworkers discovered a large amount of iridium at the K-Pg boundary (formerly known as the K-T boundary) in Gubbio, Italy, in 1977 (Yarris, 2010, para. 3). This was a significant find because the element iridium is rarely found on Earth’s surface, and the small amount that is on the surface came from asteroids (Benton, 2011, para. 21). After the iridium was found in Italy, they found similar spikes of the element in Denmark and New Zealand, which led to Alvarez’s team coming up with the theory of a massive asteroid impact (Alvarez, Alvarez, Asaro, & Michel, 1980). But, something that is CONFLICTING THEORIES  4 not usually mentioned when speaking about the extinction of the dinosaurs is that the main theory is that the impact itself did not cause the extinction; the lasting effects the impact had on the environment did. The team concluded that the asteroid impact would have created a massive cloud of dust that engulfed the earth, blocked out the sun, and prevented photosynthesis, ensuring death for plants and the many organisms that relied on plant life to survive (Benton, 2011, para. 23). After years of research, we now know that his theory was very accurate.  Impact Theory: Evidence For and Against The place where the asteroid landed, Chicxulub (chick-shoo-loob) crater, was discovered in the 1940s (Urrutia-Fucugauchi, & Perez-Cruz, 2008, p. 248) but was not associated with the extinction event until 1991 (Yarris, 2010, para. 8) when it had been further investigated and dated. The 10-kilometer wide asteroid (“Experts Reaffirm,” 2010, para. 15) touched down in modern day Mexico and created the crater, which is about 180-200 kilometers in diameter (Urrutia-Fucugauchi et al., 2008, p. 248). They know that this is the crater from the asteroid that caused the extinction because at the K-Pg boundary, the layers of sediment are thick and full of material ejected from the crash, but as you get further away from the site, the layers begin getting thinner and there is a decrease in the material until there is only one thin layer that is seen globally that perfectly coincides with the time of the extinction (“Experts Reaffirm,” 2010, para. 9). This, along with the discovery of the Chicxulub crater, is solid evidence that proves the impact theory to be correct. Even after the revelation that the Chicxulub crater was the impact site of the asteroid, it was still not enough to convince some scientists that volcanic eruptions did not kill the dinosaurs, but for good reason. At the time, Alvarez’s theory still had holes in it that had not yet been CONFLICTING THEORIES  5 explained. For example, many articles point out the fact that when the Chicxulub impact zone was drilled into, the evidence they discovered showed that the impact occurred 300,000 years before the K-Pg boundary extinction, so it could not have been the cause of the event (Keller, Adatte, Stinnesbeck, Stuben, Berner, Kramar, & Harting, 2004). This find is so important because it is one of the main arguments used against the impact theory. However, in a 2010 study conducted by a panel of experts, they refuted that claim by explaining how the area around the impact site is unreliable because the sheer force of the asteroid impacting the Earth would have created a complex and disturbed layer of sediments compared to areas further away from the impact zone (“Experts Reaffirm,” 2010, para. 7). Because of all the force the asteroid hit the earth with, the impact site is the most damaged area that could be studied. That fact does not completely invalidate the findings, but it provides a very good explanation for them. Deccan Volcanism Before the impact theory was introduced, the popular theory was volcanism, specifically Deccan volcanism. Deccan volcanism is the term used to describe the massive eruptions of the Deccan traps that covered India in lava 65 million years ago, with some eruptions spreading over 1,000 kilometers across India, according to Keller et al. (2009, p. 709). Keller, who is Professor of Paleontology and Geology at Princeton University, is a huge advocate for the theory of volcanism. She and her team state that studies have shown that there were three short phases of eruptions (p. 715). Phase one was very small, happened around 67.4 to 67.5 million years ago, and only lasted about 10 thousand years (p. 715). Phase two was much larger than phase one and phase three; it was about 80% of the full volume of Deccan traps eruptions (p. 715). The lasting time of phase two is unknown, but it ended either at or very close to the extinction event (p. 715). It is considered to be the main phase because of the amount of damage it caused. Phase three, CONFLICTING THEORIES  6 much like phase one, was small, being less than 20% of the total volume of eruptions and occurred around 270 thousand years after the K-Pg boundary (p. 715). The theory is that when these eruptions occurred, mainly the first two, they would have initiated environment changes such as acidic rain, decreased pH levels in the water, depletion of the ozone, and global temperature changes that over a long period of time, would have caused a large portion of the life on Earth to die out (Tsujita, 2001, p. 279).  Deccan Volcanism: Evidence For and Against The timing of the Deccan trap eruptions is one of the main cases made in defending the volcanism theory. The eruption of the traps was right around the time of the K-Pg extinction, and researchers at the University of California, Berkely insist that that is not a coincidence (Sanders, 2015, para. 3). Mark Richards, Professor of Earth and Planetary Science at UC Berkely stated: If you try to explain why the largest impact we know of in the last billion years happened within 100,000 years of these massive lava flows at Deccan … the chances of that occurring at random are minuscule […] It’s not a very credible coincidence (as cited in Sanders, 2015, para. 3).  This is a strong defense in favor of volcanism; it is highly unlikely that the two events are completely coincidental. Many authors and scientists agree with this idea including Keller et al. (2009) who believe the volcanism theory is overlooked because of the popularity of the impact theory and the lack of evidence directly linking the mass extinction to Deccan volcanism (p. 709). One reason that some people have believed in the volcanism theory is that it answers some questions about the extinction that they think the impact theory cannot. For example, Cameron Tsujita (2001), author and paleontology professor, states that one problem that has been a point CONFLICTING THEORIES  7 of contention is the amounts of iridium found around the famous spike at the K-Pg boundary (p. 280). In his article, he speaks on behalf of both sides of the argument. He details that volcanism defenders have said that the vertical spread of the iridium tells us how long the activity of the Deccan traps lasted, therefore eliminating the need to suggest the impact event was the cause (p. 280). Conversely, for the impact theory, he states that scientists believe the lava from the eruptions of the Deccan traps would not have been able to produce the amount of iridium that is found around the large spike at the K-Pg boundary (p. 280). This statement completely negates the argument of the volcanism defenders, and if it is true, it also disproves it. The main reason that the theory of volcanism is not as accepted as the impact theory is that there are quite a few things that it cannot explain. Later in Tsujita’s (2001) article, he explains that the volcanic hypothesis cannot explain the instant (in geologic time) extinctions that occurred at the K-Pg boundary (p. 280), but Keller et al. (2009) declares that no species’ extinctions can be directly linked to the Chicxulub impact (p. 714). They state that this is true because when the effects the impact had on the environment were studied along the impact spherule layer, which is a layer that holds material after it is scattered from an asteroid impact, there were no outstanding changes in the frequency of any species appearances (p. 714). These differing opinions indicate incorrect evidence on one side, because both cannot be true. In the aforementioned re-analysis of evidence by a group of experts in 2010, it was discovered that while there was evidence of volcanic activity in India, there were no signs of the extinction period lasting for a long time as the Deccan volcanism hypothesis suggests (“Experts Reaffirm,” 2010, para. 10). They know this because there were no significant changes found in any ecosystems in the 500,000 years before the K-Pg boundary (para. 10). The scientists also found that, at the K-Pg boundary, there was suddenly a major decrease in the amount of living things CONFLICTING THEORIES  8 (para. 10), which was evidence of the asteroid suddenly striking the earth. Another factor in the volcanism hypothesis, much like the proposed effects of the impact, involves a release of gasses into the atmosphere that would have deadly environmental effects, but the experts also proved that that could not have happened. While large amounts of sulfur were released by the volcanic eruptions into the stratosphere, they would not have had the lasting effect to cause any significant damage (para. 11). On the other hand, the impact from the asteroid would have produced much larger amounts of sulfur and dust in a shorter time that lead to the world-wide dust cloud (para. 11). All of those discoveries led the experts to determine that the cause of the K-Pg extinction could not have been volcanism, and instead had to be the asteroid impact. Conclusion  The debate between the impact and volcanism theories is a perfect example of people sometimes not letting go of past ideas. Most of the evidence points toward the impact theory being correct, with more and more evidence being found to further prove it. When Alvarez published his findings in 1980, he faced backlash from some scientists because they were very used to the idea that the K-Pg extinction was caused by volcanism (Yarris, 2010, para. 8). This is interesting because even after 38 years, some people are still unwilling to let go, even though they no longer have much of a leg to stand on.

invasional meltdown hypothesis,102595124,4 Some Remarks on Melting and Extreme Metamorphism of Crustal Rocks,,"Michael Brown, Fawna J Korhonen, Michael Brown, Fawna J. Korhonen",2015,"Abstract: Typically melting occurs during decompression in ultra-high-pressure terranes, along the evolution from peak pressure to peak temperature in medium-temperature eclogite-high-pressure granulite terranes and by simple prograde heating in granulite facies and ultra-high-temperature (UHT) metamorphic terranes. The source of heat must be due to one or more processes among thickening and radiogenic heating, viscous dissipation, and heat from asthenospheric mantle. Melt-bearing rocks become porous at a few vol % melt initiating an advective flow regime. As the melt volume approaches and exceeds the melt connectivity transition ( ~ 7 vol % melt), melt may be lost from the system in the first of several melt-loss events. In migmatites and residual granulites, a variety of microstructures indicates the for-mer presence of melt at the grain scale and leucosome networks at outcrop scale record melt extraction pathways. This evidence supports a model of focused melt flow by dilatant shear failure at low melt volume as the crust weakens with increasing melt production. Melt ascent is initiated as ductile fractures but continues in dykes that propagate as brittle fractures. Crustal rocks undergo melting via a sequence of reactions beginning with minimal melt pro-duction at the wet solidus (generally &lt; 1 vol % melt, unless there is influx of H2O-rich fluid)",,text,,,
invasional meltdown hypothesis,211561152,Effects of Mantle Melting by a Giant Impact on the Lunar Nearside,,"Schwinger, Sabrina, Zhu, Meng-Hua",2018,"A giant impact on the Procellarum region on the lunar nearside has been proposed as a possible mechanism to explain different aspects of the lunar dichotomy, including crust thickness, topography and composition. In this work we study the first steps of the post-impact evolution of the lunar mantle and crust by modeling impact melting, melt pool formation and differentiation and their contribution to the development of the lunar dichotomy.    Using the iSALE code, we modeled the impact of a 800km sized projectile onto the Procellarum region on the lunar nearside. Based on the pressure and temperature conditions predicted by the impact model, solidus and liquidus curves and compositional partial melting models for target and projectile materials we calculated the volumes and compositions of local partial melts, that ascend to form a melt pool in the impact region.    We used alphaMELTS to model fractional crystallization of the melt pool, the formation of a secondary crust by plagioclase floatation and the subsidence of the Procellarum region resulting from melt pool solidification. In addition we determined the duration of melt pool crystallization, considering melt pool convection and heat conduction through a growing crust.    We found that partial melting and melt pool formation lead to a local enrichment of the upper mantle in incompatible elements (e.g. K, REE, P, Fe, Ti, Th), potentially explaining the compositional anomaly in the Procellarum region. The thickness of the secondary crust forming in the Procellarum region is consistent with GRAIL observations and the duration of magma pool crystallization is consistent with the ages of crustal rocks and the model age of urKREEP",,"Konferenzbeitrag, NonPeerReviewed",Planetenphysik,,

In situ bones of extinct megafauna and Clovis tools occur only beneath this black layer and not within or above it. At the base of the black mat at 9 Clovis-age sites in North America and a site in Belgium numerous extraterrestrial impact markers were found including magnetic grains highly enriched in iridium, magnetic microspherules, vesicular carbon spherules enriched in cubic, hexagonal, and n-type nanodiamonds, glass-like carbon containing Fullerenes and nanodiamonds, charcoal, soot, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The same impact markers were found mixed throughout the sediments of 15 Carolina Bays, elliptical depressions along the Atlantic coast, whose parallel major axes point towards either the Great Lakes or Hudson Bay. The magnetic grains and spherules have an unusual Fe/Ti composition similar to lunar Procellarum KREEP Terrane and the organic constituents are enriched in 14C leading to radiocarbon dates often well into the future. These characteristics are inconsistent with known meteorites and suggest that the impact was by a previous unobserved, possibly extrasolar body. The concentration of impact markers peaks near the Great Lakes and their unusually high water content suggests that a 4.6 km-wide comet fragmented and exploded over the Laurentide Ice Sheet creating numerous craters that now persist at the bottom of the Great Lakes. The coincidence of this impact, the onset of Younger Dryas cooling, extinction of the megafauna, and the appearance of a black mat strongly suggests that all these events are directly related.

IntroductionThickened orogenic crust is found to be or have been in a partially molten state in modern (Nelson et al., 1996;Schilling et al., 1997) and in past orogenies (Brown, 2001; Vanderhaeghe & Teyssier, 2001). Partial melting ofthe lower crust during the evolution of an orogen produces granite-migmatite belts that have been generallyattributed to either (a) thickening of the crust during orogenesis and associated increase in the radiogenicheating raising the geotherm enough for crustal anatexis (Bea, 2012; Thompson & Connolly, 1995) or (b) athermal pulse from the mantle, induced by slab break-off (Davies & von Blanckenburg, 1995) or convectivethinning, delamination, or foundering of the thickened lithospheric mantle (Bonin, 2004; Platt & England,1994; Sylvester, 1998; Yuen & Fleitout, 1985).To reach high enough temperatures for anatexis by crustal thickening only, twice the original crustal thick-ness is needed (Bea, 2012; Thompson & Connolly, 1995). This mechanism is especially problematic in regionswhere syncollisional high-temperature/low-pressure metamorphism points to only modest crustal thickening(Finger et al., 2009; Franke, 2000). Therefore, a nonnegligible mantle contribution to the increased tempera-tures is often necessary to explain the formation of widespread crustal melting. This mantle contribution inthe generation of the granite-migmatite belts is supported by the presence of primitive (ultra)potassic mag-mas, either as intrusive bodies or as a ubiquitous component of the granitoids (e.g., Couzinié et al., 2014, 2016;Ledru et al., 2001; Väisänen et al., 2000). Based on their geochemistry, the mantle-derived magmas are inter-preted to originate from a hydrous metasomatic mantle (Bonin, 2004; Murphy, 2013; Turner et al., 1996), andtheir underplating at the crust-mantle transition zone (CMTZ; e.g., Williamson et al., 1992) would promotecrustal melting through heat advection (Petford & Gallagher, 2001).Cessation of the tectonic compression and a sudden change in the gravitational potential energy by founder-ing of the lithospheric mantle and subsequent dynamic uplift are thought to cause orogenic collapse at thelater stages of the orogeny (Dewey, 1988). Collapse (synconvergent extension) is even possible with con-tinuing tectonic convergence and compression, since crustal melting causes rheological weakening of thelower to middle crust (Gray & Pysklywec, 2012; Vanderhaeghe & Teyssier, 2001).

Rapid exhumation might also enhance the melting as pressure decreases (Teyssier &Whitney, 2002).A rheologically weak layer at or near the CMTZ has also been recognized as an important feature and a pre-requisite for mantle delamination (Bird, 1979; Meissner & Mooney, 1998). Usually, this decoupling is thoughtto arise from the rheological layering of the lithosphere, where the lower crust is inherently weaker than theunderlying lithospheric mantle, decoupling these two from each other, and allowing the negatively buoyantlithospheric mantle to sink into the asthenosphere. Even small melt fractions can significantly weaken crustalrocks (e.g., Rosenberg & Handy, 2005), suggesting that, if present near or at the CMTZ, partial melting couldalso cause such a weak layer, too.Numerical and conceptual models of both crustal collapse (e.g., Jamieson et al., 2004; Liu & Yang, 2003; Reyet al., 2010; Teyssier & Whitney, 2002) and foundering of lithospheric mantle (e.g., Chung et al., 2003; Göğüş &Pysklywec, 2008; Göğüş et al., 2017; Nelson, 1992) are numerous, but the interaction of these two processeshas gained less attention. In many models of crustal collapse the focus lies in the exhumation and extension ofthe crust, and thus, the lower boundary of the model is the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, which doesnot give the mantle convection an active role or allow for dynamic mass transfer between lithosphere andasthenosphere. With the exception of few (e.g., Ueda et al., 2012) models of lithospheric foundering, crustalprocesses do not possess an active and evolving role but are only passively responding to mantle processes,for example, melting, extension, and collapse after removal of the lithospheric mantle. Numerical models ofother geological settings (e.g., Gerya & Meilick, 2011) that incorporate dynamic melting models have shownthe importance of rheological weakening by fluids and melts to the overall dynamics of the system.Widespread crustal anatexis in synorogenic to postorogenic processes, that is, formation of thegranite-migmatite belts, is important not only for the crustal collapse and extension but also for the under-lying mantle lithosphere dynamics: Melt-induced weakening in the lower crust could drive the crust-mantledecoupling even further and can trigger wholesale, catastrophic mantle lithosphere removal and thus strongasthenospheric upwelling. For example Göğüş and Pysklywec (2008) have shown that this would happenin the presence of an explicitly imposed weak layer. Here we propose and test a more dynamic hypothesis,in which partial melting and layer decoupling reinforce each other. For this purpose, we present numericalmodels of convectively thinning postcollisional lithosphere, integrated with melting models for both mantleand crustal melts, and melt-induced rheological weakening. We use these models to show that crustal andmantle processes interact in a fundamental way, where not only the processes taking place in the mantleaffect generation of granite-migmatite belts but also the anatexis within the crust can change the evolutionof the whole lithosphere.2. MethodsWe study the convection and melting of the mantle and crust in a syncollisional to postcollisional settingwhere the mantle rocks are overlain by a moderately thickened crust. Our models assume a metasomatic man-tle which has been hydrated by a previous subduction system and where water is accommodated by bothnominally anhydrous phases and hydrous phases. Water in nominally anhydrous mantle phases decreasestheir viscosity (e.g., Mei & Kohlstedt, 2000)—and consequently the upper mantle viscosity—enhances sub-lithospheric convection and leads to localized thinning of the mantle lithosphere. Melting in the crust and inthe mantle is dynamically coupled to the convecting mantle, and feedback effects by consumption of latentheat and changes in the rock composition and physical parameters (viscosity and density) are taken intoaccount.2.1. Mantle Convection ModelWe solve the equations for conservation of mass, momentum, and energy with a finite element code Citcom(Moresi & Gurnis, 1996; Zhong et al., 2000) to model the mantle convection in a 2-D model domain with dimen-sions of 660 km × 2,640 km and grid resolution of 64 × 256 elements. Adiabatic heating, shear heating, andheating by radioactive elements are taken into account (extended Boussinesq approximation; Christensen &Yuen, 1985). A linear temperature, pressure, and water content-dependent rheology is used, similar to the oneKAISLANIEMI ET AL. 3103Tectonics 10.1029/2018TC005014Table 1Values of Physical Parameters Used in the ModelsParameter Symbol (unit) Value usedActivation energy E (J/mol) 1.2 × 105Activation volume V (m3/mol) 6 × 10−6Radiogenic heating Q (W/kg) 19 × 10−12Thermal diffusivity 𝜅 (m2/s) 10−6Heat capacity Cp (J⋅kg−1⋅K−1) 1, 250Reference temperature T0,abs (K) 1, 623Reference pressure P0 (Pa) 21.4 × 109Reference viscosity 𝜂0 (Pa s) 1022Effective visc.

See Table 1 and Figure 1 for other parameters and their values. Linearrheology with low thermal activation energy has been shown (van Hunenet al., 2005) to produce similar thermal boundary layer dynamics than anon-linear rheology (n = 3.5) with an activation energy in the range of 360to 540 kJ/mol. We therefore use this parameterization instead of nonlinearrheology, which is numerically more challenging to solve.Melt weakening of the rock, caused by unextracted partial melts occupyinggrain boundaries, is parameterized with a relation?̇?(𝜙)?̇?(0)= exp (𝛽𝜙) (2)(Mei et al., 2002), where ?̇? is the strain rate, 𝜙 is the melt fraction, and 𝛽 ≈ 26 in the diffusion creep regime.With a linear rheology, this converts to𝜂𝜙 = exp (−𝛽𝜙) (3)Melt weakening is limited by the forced lower limit for the viscosity (see Table 1).For the lithospheric structure, we use the so called jelly sandwich rheology model (Burov & Watts, 2006) wherethe base of the crust is significantly weaker than the lithospheric mantle (Kohlstedt et al., 1995; Ranalli &Murphy, 1987; Wang et al., 2012). This provides a possible zone for the decoupling of crust and lithosphericmantle. The cause of this weak layer is the thermally activated creep of the wet quartz and feldspars below thebrittle/ductile transition depth (Rybacki et al., 2006). The extent of this weakening, however, has been sub-ject to debate (Jackson, 2002). We simplify the rheological model by using the same diffusion creep rheologyfor both the crust and the mantle and lowering the effective viscosity of the crust by 2 orders of magnitude.Together with the temperature-dependent viscosity this leads to an effective viscosity profile where there isa weak layer in the transition from mantle to lower crust but then at the shallower (i.e., cooler) depths thestrength of the lithosphere quickly increases again.A marker-in-cell method (Gerya & Yuen, 2003) is used to carry and advect temperature and lithologicalinformation. There are on average 40 markers per grid element, of which 50% carry the rock compositioninformation for melting models, and all markers are used for temperature advection. Each marker representsa constant volume fraction of a grid element.Figure 1. Model setup (not to scale). Brown/gray colors: crust; red colors: mantle.

Melting ModelsThe models consider the melting of crustal and mantle rocks. For the mantle rocks, we use a parameterizedmelting model of hydrous peridotite by Katz et al. (2003). For crustal rocks, we calculate the liquidus and theamount of melt via a Gibbs free energy minimization strategy with PerpleX (Connolly, 2005; 2009). This permitsa dynamic integration of the melting models so that the solidus of the crustal lithology depends on its fertilitythrough its composition and melt depletion.The parameterized melting model of the mantle rocks gives the amount of melt produced and the watercontent of the melt given the pressure, temperature, and water content of the bulk rock (a peridotite). Thisis used in the convection model to (1) modify the residual water content with bulk partitioning coefficientDH2O = 0.01 as used by Katz et al. (2003); (2) modify the rocks’ effective mantle viscosity due to melt weakeningand amount of water present, according to equation (1); (3) calculate the amount of latent heat consumed inthe melting; and (4) modify the density of the residue. The density 𝜌 of lherzolite reduces with depletion F%,following the relationdln𝜌dF%= −0.00020 (4)which is applicable at approximately 3 GPa (Schutt & Lesher, 2006). Here F% = 100F, where F is the depletionparameter, that is, the fraction of total extracted melt from the bulk rock.PerpleX performs Gibbs energy minimization for a given crustal rock composition, carried within the lithologyinformation of the markers. Input parameters are the amounts of major elements (in this case in NCKFMASHT:Na2O, CaO, K2O, FeOT, MgO, Al2O3, SiO2, H2O, and TiO2), pressure, temperature, and the thermodynamic datalibraries for the minerals and the solid solutions. We use the thermodynamic data from Holland and Powell(1998, revised in 2004), and their solid solutions (for garnet, pyroxenes, olivine, spinel, biotite, mica, chlorite,and chloritoid), except for amphibole (Wei & Powell, 2003; White et al., 2003), feldspars (Fuhrman & Lindsley,1988), melt (White et al., 2001)—with modified pressure dependency of a sillimanite liquid from Bouilholet al. (2015)—and the equation of state of water from Holland and Powell (1991). Results from the Gibbsenergy minimization include the amount and composition of the stable phases (i.e., of minerals and liquidphases). This information is used (1) to modify the residue composition (all nine major oxides), which thenaffects subsequent melt processes, and (2) to calculate the consumption of latent heat in the melting. PerpleXresults are tabulated prior to model run for unmodified rock compositions and recalculated each time stepfor modified rock compositions that are not available within the lookup table.Depending on model parameters (Table 2), melts are extracted in some models and left in place in other mod-els. Where melts are removed, the properties of the melt-depleted residue are updated with the informationfrom the melting models, as described above. If melts are retained, the amount of melting is only recordedbut the chemical properties of the bulk rock are not changed (i.e., the melt is assumed to stay in equilibriumwith the rock and the latent heat of melting is still available for the rock during subsequent time steps).Where crustal melts are extracted the melt (mass and latent heat) is removed from the model domain andits amount recorded. Where mantle melts are extracted they are assumed to advect upward and immedi-ately underplate the crust at the CMTZ. Only the thermal effect of the underplating is taken into account: thesensible and latent heat of the melts is removed from the source regions and used to increase the tempera-ture between z = 41 km and z = 52 km, that is, distributed within the markers inside the grid element thatencloses the CMTZ.Crustal melts are only extracted if the amount of partial melt exceeds the removal threshold. The used valueof 8% for crustal melts represents a liquid percolation threshold (Vigneresse et al., 1996) at which point meltKAISLANIEMI ET AL. 3105Tectonics 10.1029/2018TC005014pockets become connected. Once this threshold is exceeded, all melts are removed. No threshold is imposedfor mantle melts; the low viscosity of mantle melts and the high strain rates caused by the sublithosphericsmall-scale convection (SSC) are assumed to effectively extract mantle melts by stress-driven melt segregation(Kohlstedt & Holtzman, 2009). See section 4 about the effect of these thresholds for the model behavior.2.3. Model SetupFigure 1 shows the model setup. An upper mantle model domain with aspect ratio 4 (2,640 × 660 km) iscreated, in which a thickened crust (45 km) and a total (chemical) lithosphere thickness of 90 km representthe structure of the lithosphere after collision and subsequent rethinning of the lithosphere. The tempera-ture is 0 ∘C at the surface and fixed at 1690 ∘C (potential temperature 1360 ∘C) at the bottom, with zero heatflow at the lateral boundaries. The bottom boundary condition temperature is chosen so that the poten-tial temperature of the convecting mantle is at a realistic level (1330 ± 10 ∘C). Internal radiogenic heatingis constant throughout the model domain and is increased by a factor of 3 compared to real mantle values(cf. Kaislaniemi & van Hunen, 2014). This is done to replace bottom heating by a similar amount of internalheating. This replacement therefore maintains a similar thermal evolution, while suppressing the generationof plume-like upwellings that would be caused by mainly bottom-heated models and that would increasethe complexity of the models and, in some cases, would help destabilize the lithospheric mantle. It is likelythat the high-viscosity lower mantle helps anchor plumes in one place (Lowman & Gable, 2008). Our modelsare restricted to the upper mantle only, and thus, other measures are needed to suppress the appearance ofplumes. We limit the applicability of our models to environments where plume interaction with the orogeniclithosphere is likely to have been absent. All boundaries have a free-slip velocity boundary condition. The ini-tial density structure (Figure 1) takes into account the upper and lower crust and the lithospheric mantle witha small inherent compositional, depleted-related buoyancy compared to the sublithospheric mantle.All models are started from an initial premelt model where the thermal lithosphere thickness has reached astatistical steady state, so that the 1250 ∘C isotherm has located at z =90 km for about 40 Myr. These initialmodels are run using the model setup from Figure 1 and parameters from the reference model (M000, Table 2),with all melting disabled. Once the steady state is reached, melt calculations and parameters according toTable 2 are switched on. In the results shown, this moment has a model time of 0 Myr and is common for allthe models.The water content of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle in postcollisional areas is not well constrained,but several lines of evidence suggest that it is enriched is volatile elements, and especially water. Such enrich-ment is clearly inherited from the subduction system that preceded collision (e.g., Prelević et al., 2013). Anominally anhydrous mantle contains up to 200-ppm H2O (Hirschmann, 2006), and in several places xenolithsshow widespread and heterogeneous evidence of metasomatism inherited from subduction. The metaso-matic character of the mantle is demonstrated by the presence of phlogopite and/or amphibole in mantlexenoliths present in high-K postcollisional mantle melts (e.g., in Tibet; ; Liu et al., 2011) or in recent volcaniccenters sampling postorogenic mantle (e.g., in the Massif-Central; ; Lenoir et al., 2000). Although heteroge-neously distributed, hydrous phases can amount to as much as 5 wt %, thus making up to 2,000 ppm of H2Oin a phlogopite-bearing mantle. Our models use a value of 400 ppm of H2O for the mantle, a value abovethe nominally anhydrous mantle, representing a reasonable estimate of a metasomatic mantle (containing∼ 2wt% of amphibole or ∼ 1wt% of phlogopite). This hydrous mantle represents conditions in a postcolli-sional setting where previous subduction has been hydrating the overlying lithospheric mantle and leads torelatively strong localized intermittent and temporary thinning of the lithosphere is, in itself, not enough todestabilize the whole lithospheric mantle (i.e., the average thickness of the thermal lithosphere is constantand reached in the initial premelt model calculations).For the initial crustal rock composition, we use a global estimate from Rudnick and Fountain (1995) for a gen-eral average lower crust composition of platform and shield areas (SiO2: 52.4; MgO: 7.1; CaO: 9.5; Al2O3: 16.5;Na2O: 2.7; K2O: 0.6; FeOT: 8.2; TiO2: 0.8 wt %) with a water content of 1.5 wt %.To test the effects of partial lower crust and mantle melting to the lithosphere stability, we have run the modelswith varying controlling parameters (Table 2).KAISLANIEMI ET AL. 3106Tectonics 10.1029/2018TC005014Figure 2.

High water content, compared to dry mantle, lowers viscosity, enhances convection, and causes the size ofthe convection cells to decrease to about 100–300 km in diameter. This enhanced convection heats the lithospheremore effectively from below and erodes the bottom of the lithosphere, causing some locations (e.g., A) to have locallydecreasing lithosphere thickness, but other locations to increase in lithosphere thickness (e.g., B). The locations ofthickened and thinned lithosphere vary in time, so that small-scale convection alone does not lead to removal of thewhole lithospheric mantle but instead a thinned (heated) lithosphere is rethickened (cooled) later, and the averagelithosphere thickness reaches a steady state value (approximately 100 km in the models here). Some asthenosphericmelts may appear temporarily in places where lithosphere is thinned (crosses near A and C; cf. Kaislaniemi et al., 2014).Horizontal average of the effective viscosity is shown on the right.3. ResultsA complex interplay between melt weakening, depletion stiffening, and chemical depletion can be observedin the models (Figure 2). The model setup in the initial premelt model leads to a (statistical) steady state wherethe lithosphere thickness is locally and temporally thinned and then thickened again. The locations of thesethinned and thickened regions vary through time. This is caused by the sublithospheric SSC that is enhancedby the elevated water concentrations in the mantle.After this initial premelt model, the behavior of the models depends on the used parameters (Table 2). Inreference model M000, melt amounts are calculated but do not affect the flow (Figures 3a–3d): melt does notweaken the material and is not extracted. This model continues to produce SSC, and the average lithospherethickness does not change. Partial melting takes place in the lowermost crust, with increased degree abovelocally thinned lithosphere. At the same time, some asthenospheric melts are produced by decompressionmelting below the thinned locations. As the melts are not removed, they will solidify once the SSC patternchanges and lowers the geotherm again.In models where melt weakening is enabled (M1xx), partial crustal and asthenospheric melting leads to adecrease in the viscosity. This weakening produces a positive feedback (Figures 3e–3h) where melt weakeningsustains further thinning of the lithosphere—leading to complete removal of the lithospheric mantle—andthus also higher total amounts of both crustal and mantle melts as compared to model M000. Such completeremoval of the lithospheric mantle takes place as dripping of the lithosphere into the asthenosphere and ismore akin to (fast) convective thinning, or foundering as drips, than to delamination as one coherent layer(Bird, 1979).The removal of the lithospheric mantle in model M100 (Figures 3e–3h) takes approximately 20 Myr, changingfrom almost intact mantle lithosphere at about 50-Myr model time to completely absent mantle lithosphere,spanning 200 km horizontally, at 70 Myr. The timing and location of this event is, to some extent, random:it is triggered by the SSC, which itself is chaotic in a sense that the convection cells that locally thicken andthin the lithosphere move horizontally in a random pattern. Whenever the lithosphere happens to be thinnedstrongly enough for long enough time to raise the geotherm at lower crustal levels, the complete, catastrophic,foundering of mantle lithosphere can start. Despite the randomness caused by SSC, the overall convectivethinning of the lithosphere has a systematic control on timing and location of the full mantle lithosphereremoval: once the global lithosphere thickness has decreased to level that small local perturbations start toaffect crustal temperatures, complete foundering has a chance to start.3.1. Mantle InputWhen underplating of mantle melts at CMTZ is enabled in the models (M110, Figure 4), this is found to initiallyincrease the crustal melting rate, but to decrease the total amount of crustal melting. This is caused by changesKAISLANIEMI ET AL. 3107Tectonics 10.1029/2018TC005014Figure 3. Comparison of models with melt weakening effects disabled (a–d, model M000) and enabled (e–h, model M100). Background colors describe thetemperature field. Red dots indicate markers of crustal lithology with more than zero partial melt. Melt weakening (e–h) leads to positive feedback and enhancedlithospheric thinning (f ) and eventually to complete removal of the lithospheric mantle (g, h). White contour shows the crust-mantle transition zone, thelithological boundary between crust and mantle. Black contours show degree of mantle melting (1%, 3%, and 5%). Velocity arrows scale with the axes (km/Myr).in the melt source regions: Once the mantle melts are extracted and advected to the CMTZ, the residue leftin the mantle is low in water content, since most of the water was partitioned in the melt. This melt-depletedmantle has a higher viscosity than the fertile mantle. At the same time, the weakening of the residue causedby the presence of melts disappears (as the melts are drained away). Removing water from the mantle rockalso makes it more refractory and production of further mantle melts is hindered. Additionally, the depletedperidotite is less dense than fertile peridotite. All these effects accumulate to cause the mantle source regionfor the underplating melts to become a layer of high-viscosity, buoyant and refractory material. This stops thethinning of the lithosphere and shields the crust and remaining lithospheric mantle from the hot convectingmantle below. The foundering ends and the lithosphere starts to cool and thicken again, so that the layer ofdepleted mantle material becomes part of the stable lithosphere.If there is no underplating of the mantle melts at the CMTZ but melts are left in their place within the mantle(M100), the viscosity remains low because of the melt weakening effect of the melts. Initial amounts of crustalmelting are not increased by the advection of heat from the melts. However, the foundering is driven furtherby the presence of the low-viscosity mantle melts and will spread horizontally to span more than 400 km.Additionally, the lithosphere regains its thickness very slowly, extending the time the lower crust is exposedto the hot convecting mantle. This leads to prolonged times of crustal melting. Extraction of the crustal melts(in M111) has a similar negative feedback effect on any further crustal melting, because melt removal leavesa residue that is more refractory in composition (Figures 5d and 5e).3.2. Melt ProductionThe models where melt weakening is enabled, and most of the mantle lithosphere is removed, show a charac-teristic pattern of melt production. In model M111, where both crustal and mantle melts are extracted, minorKAISLANIEMI ET AL. 3108Tectonics 10.1029/2018TC005014Figure 4. In models where mantle melts are extracted and underplate the crust at crust-mantle transition zone (model M110, a–c) a high-viscosity buoyantresidue layer is formed underneath the crust (blue contours, 1%, 3%, and 5% melt depletion). This protects the lithosphere from further thinning and allows it tocool back to its original thickness (c). If mantle melts are not extracted (model M100, d–f ) foundering of the lithospheric mantle continues longer and extendsover broader region. Plot of horizontally averaged crustal melt amount across section x = 1,000–1,600 km (g) shows that underplating initially promotes crustalmelting (green line) but eventually slows down as compared to without underplating (blue line). Note that the decrease in the melt amount is possible since thecrustal melts are not extracted and may thus recrystallize. Velocity arrows scale with the axes (km/Myr).amounts of partial melts, that is, summed layer thickness up to maximum of 500 m, exist in the lowermostcrust before the lithospheric mantle is foundered into the asthenosphere (Figures 5a and 5d). The degree ofmelting is initially not large enough to extract any melt (Figure 5b, before 25 Myr). As the SSC produces alocally thinned region of lithosphere, the hot convecting mantle moves closer to the lowermost crust, pro-ducing more crustal melts. This initiates the discussed positive feedback mechanism, as seen in model M100,leading to further thinning and melting. The degree of crustal melts exceeds the liquid percolation thresh-old and the crustal melts can be extracted (Figure 5b, after 25 Myr). Once the crustal melts are extracted, therefractory residue does not melt further, and the production of crustal melts slowly disappears. The convect-ing mantle, however, still drags pieces of crust horizontally and then down deeper into the mantle, formingtracks of crustal melting taking place at the boundaries of the extremely thin mantle lithosphere, spreadinghorizontally as the region of foundering lithosphere expands.At the culmination of the mantle lithosphere removal, when the hot convecting mantle comes in directcontact with the crust, there is a single pulse of crustal melting and melt extraction (Figure 5b, at 50 Myr,x = 1,350 km), lasting 5 to 10 Myr. Shortly prior to this, at ∼ 43 Myr, a strong pulse of mantle melting com-mences. This pulse of mantle melts, although fading, continues for up to 30 Myr, since the convection canreplace some of the depleted mantle with fertile material from below.KAISLANIEMI ET AL. 3109Tectonics 10.1029/2018TC005014Figure 5.

DiscussionOur results indicate significant interactions between mantle and crustal processes as the destabilization ofthe orogenic lithosphere proceeds. We show how sublithospheric SSC increases mantle heat flow into thelower crust enough to trigger minor crustal anatexis which may, via positive feedback effects, result in catas-trophic foundering of the whole mantle lithosphere into the asthenosphere. A prerequisite for this to happenis a lithosphere that has reached close its original thickness after collision, and a moderately elevated watercontents in the upper mantle.From these results, we can better understand the formation of granite-migmatite belts in the frame of post-collisional settings and propose a model that characterizes the roles of the mantle and the crust: Convectivethinning of the orogenic thickened lithosphere brings the lithosphere closer to its original thickness. Thermalrelaxation and subsequent increased basalt heat flow by the sublithospheric SSC leads to higher tempera-tures in the crust and uppermost lithospheric mantle, as well, and increases temperatures above the solidusat the lower level of the thickened crust, starting the formation of migmatites. These partial melts in the lowercrust may exist for prolonged times. The nature of the SSC causes variation in the degree of melting, and therheological weakening by the partial melts can trigger foundering of the whole lithospheric mantle in placeswhere amount of partial melts is high enough. The water initially introduced by subduction into the overrid-ing plate through metasomatism allows the initiation of SSC, and (conceptually) also added to the convectivethinning prior to its initiation.KAISLANIEMI ET AL. 3110Tectonics 10.1029/2018TC005014Removal of the mantle lithosphere leads to strong asthenospheric upwelling and extensive melting bydecompression where the lithosphere is thinnest. Within about 20–30 Myr the lower crust is exposed to theasthenosphere over a distance of a few hundred kilometers. There is a significant increase in the lower crustalmelting. This pulse of crustal melt formation continues for about 5–10 Myr. The degree of melting in the crustrises above the critical threshold of melt extraction, which would ultimately trigger the formation of graniticplutons in higher crustal levels. This process can explain the generation of postcollisional granite-migmatitezones showing long-lived anatectic crust followed by extensive melt extraction and emplacement associatedwith mantle-derived magmatism. The crustal melting stops rather abruptly, and the mantle-derived magma-tism slowly wanes as the lithosphere grows back to its steady state thickness. As a result of this whole process,mantle melts are temporally related to crustal melting but have different spatial distribution (cf. Figures 5band 5c).4.1. Relation to Observed Late-Orogenic MagmatismThis scenario fits the temporal and petrogenetic relations between the migmatites, granitic plutons, and maficbodies produced at late stages of many orogenic collisions. The granitic suites (Bonin, 2004) of crustal originare typically associated with postcollisional mafic magmas that are rich in both compatible (Mg, Fe, Ni, andCr) and incompatible elements (K2O, high-field-strength elements, and light rare-earth elements; e.g., Castroet al., 2003; Fowler, 1988; Fowler & Rollinson, 2012; Graessner et al., 2000; Kotkova et al., 2010; Molina et al.,2012; Murphy, 2013). They are most often deduced to have their sources in the lithospheric mantle that hasbeen enriched by incompatible crustal components during the subduction. These postcollisional mafic mag-mas are coeval or slightly predate the granitic plutonism, both of which, in turn, postdate crustal anatexis ofvariable durations (in some cases with considerable overlap). This is the case, for example, in the CanadianCordillera (Gordon et al., 2008) with 20 Myr of progressive gneiss-migmatite formation ending in a short pulseof leucogranite plutonism; in the Proterozoic Svecofennian orogeny (Väisänen et al., 2000) where shoshoniticmantle melts intervene the granite-migmatite belt formation over 20 Myrs; in the Variscan orogeny in centralSpain (Montero et al., 2004) and in Calabria (Graessner et al., 2000); and, as a well studied example, the Velaydome region of the eastern French Massif Central (Couzinié et al., 2014; Laurent et al., 2017).The Velay dome granite-migmatite complex is one of the best studied examples of a large-scale anatectic sys-tem that developed in a late orogenic stage. It hosts abundant and diverse granitoid rocks that have beenemplaced at the end of the collision and throughout the late-orogenic collapse. These granitoids are formedin two stages (Laurent et al., 2017): (1) metamorphism and limited, water-present partial melting during340–314 Ma, and (2) high-temperature, extensive biotite breakdown melting at 310–300 Ma, finally leadingto the collapse and formation of the Velay dome itself at 305–300 Ma. These granitoids are sourced from theorthogneisses and paragneisses of the local orogenic crust and have been measured with P-T conditions of5–6 kbar, 720–750 ∘C, and 4–5 kbar, 750–850 ∘C, for the two stages, respectively (Barbey et al., 1999; Bouilholet al., 2006; Couzinié et al., 2014; Montel et al., 1992; Mougeot et al., 1996). Volumetrically minor enclaves ofgabbroic to dioritic rocks, vaugnerites, are ubiquitously hosted within the granitoids. The vaugnerites havehigh-K to shoshonitic affinities and are rich in incompatible trace elements, taken as evidence for havingtheir source in the metasomatized lithospheric mantle (Couzinié et al., 2016). The vaugnerites are generatedthroughout the 340–300 Ma period but seem to have a peak in their generation rate at circa 315–305 Ma(Couzinié et al., 2014; Laurent et al., 2017), slightly before the collapse and formation of the Velay dome. The40 Myr period of sustained high heat flux and crustal anatexis requires a long-lived thermal anomaly, and,also, a mechanism to explain the incubation period of 340–310 Ma before the more extensive melt produc-tion commences. The apparent lack of orogenic root underneath the eastern French Massif Central (Averbuch& Piromallo, 2012) suggests that removal of the lithospheric mantle after the collision could have contributedthis extra heating. We suggest that our model presented above provides the mechanism for this mantle litho-sphere removal and explains the spatiotemporal relations of the mantle and crustal melts in the Velay domegranite-migmatite complex. The mantle melts of our models represent the vaugnerite magmatism, and thelower crustal melts directly and indirectly, via advective heating, contribute to the granitic magmatism andincreased geotherm at the upper crustal levels.Our model agrees well with the above-mentioned observations from the Velay dome region of the Variscanorogeny but could be more generally applied to other orogenies that show marks of orogenic collapse, as well.The new model for the formation of orogenic granite-migmatite belts presented here shows the importanceof the interaction between mantle and crustal processes and suggests less straightforward cause-and-effectrelationships than existing conceptual models: the asthenospheric upwelling associated with the orogenicKAISLANIEMI ET AL. 3111Tectonics 10.1029/2018TC005014collapse is not a passive upwelling caused by the lithospheric extension, nor does it need to be the primaryinitiator of the high-temperature metamorphism of the lower crust, as commonly suggested (e.g., Liu & Shen,1998; Sonder & Jones, 1999). Instead, in our models, such upwelling postdates the beginning of the crustalanatexis that is initiated by convective downwellings that thin the lithosphere by SSC and plays an importantrole only once the lower crust is sufficiently weakened by the partial melts. Though dating of these progrademetamorphic events from the geological record might prove difficult for geochronology, we note that themantle-derived magmatism intervening crustal plutonism requires some concurrency of mantle and crustalmelt extraction. This requirement is fulfilled in the described model. Dome-like structures at the bottom ofthe crust can be formed after the foundering of the lithospheric mantle (cf. Figure 5e) causing lateral variationin the degree of partial melting within the crust.4.2. Feedback MechanismsThe extraction rates of mantle and crustal melts are critical for the positive feedback effect between melt weak-ening and lithosphere removal to work. If all crustal melts are extracted at the same rate as they form, therewill be no melt present in the lower crust to cause the rheological weakening, and thus, the positive feedbackeffect is disabled. Immediate extraction of mantle melts does not have an equally dramatic effect, althoughretention of mantle melts does favor stronger thinning of the lithosphere and more extensive lower crustmelting. Consequently, the process of granite-migmatite belt formation, mantle lithosphere detachment, andorogenic collapse can be brought to a halt by early melt extraction. Variations in melting history (fast/slowproduction of melts) and/or in melt extraction threshold values (lithology, deformation-enhanced extraction)could perhaps explain why some orogenies (e.g., Uralides and Trans-Hudson orogeny) have not experiencedorogenic collapse but instead have a structure of an arrested orogeny with relatively thick crust underlain bymechanically intact lithosphere (Artemieva & Mooney, 2001; Leech, 2001). Strength increase due to early meltextraction might provide a mechanism for stopping a self-sustaining delamination process also in other set-tings. Further studies are needed to resolve how sensitive the initiation and halting of full mantle lithosphereremoval is to melt extraction rates. Our models used melt percolation thresholds of 8% (for crustal rocks) and0/∞% (for mantle rocks). These values directly affect the melt extraction rates, and variation in these valuesis likely to affect the behavior of the models: Higher percolation thresholds will allow the mantle lithosphereremoval to progress further before melt removal slows down the process (cf. models M100 and M110).Underplating of mafic magmas from the mantle at the CMTZ has been suggested to promote crustal melt-ing (Annen & Sparks, 2002; Laube & Springer, 1998; Petford & Gallagher, 2001). However, in order to produceobserved melt volumes within the crust, enough heat must be transferred from the mantle. This requires semi-continuous or periodic underplating of mantle melts. Our results indicate that this supply is dependent on theprocesses that take place at the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary. Advection of underplating magmasleaves behind a residue that diminishes further supply of melts. This process is sensitive to the amount of waterin the mantle: high water content causes more extensive mantle melting, and thus higher amounts of under-plating and crustal melting, and also stronger contrasts in viscosity and buoyancy between the fertile mantleand the depleted mantle. The shielding layer of this depleted mantle will be more effective in this case andwill prevent further mantle melting and underplating efficiently. Our parameterization of density decrease asa function of melt depletion follows Schutt and Lesher (2006) who considered dry phases. If removal of lighthydrous phases (mica and amphibole) from the residue would lead to its density increase instead, this wouldlead to less buoyant layer of depleted shield, and possible faster or more extensive removal of the lithosphericmantle. The depleted shielding layer is likely to form, anyway, at some later point, after the consumption ofhydrous phases from the source.Our models show that purely mantle-dominated processes can cause crustal anatexis assuming postcolli-sional SSC at the asthenosphere-lithosphere boundary and the positive feedback between mantle/crustalmelting and further lithosphere thinning by melt weakening. Other processes suggested to be the heat sourcefor granite-migmatite belt formation, such as increased radiogenic heating in the thickened crust, are notnecessary. Should they take place, however, their effect would promote the crustal melting but would notremove the positive feedback effect between melting and lithosphere thinning observed in our models. Forexample, Maierová et al. (2016) used crustal scale numerical models to study the gravitational overturn ofthe thickened orogenic crust in hot, large orogens, such as the European Variscides, with a relaminated fel-sic lower crust. They showed that the gravity overturn happens even with minor gravity inversion in the crustand that the consequent exhumation of the lower crust is enhanced by rheological weakening due to partialmelting. Our models have significantly less detailed description of the crust, but these results can be seen asKAISLANIEMI ET AL. 3112Tectonics 10.1029/2018TC005014complementary to each other: The mantle processes described here provide additional heat for the melt-ing of the (lower) crust, and buoyancy-driven exchanges within the crust described by Maierová et al. (2016)form the final crustal structure of the orogen with the heterogeneous, partially molten, middle crust and itspolyphase tectonic history. Similarly, even though a postcollisional slab break-off at shallow level could be apotential cause for increased basal heating of the crust, our results show that it is not necessary to explain thecrustal anatexis and mafic magmatism.5. ConclusionsWe have investigated numerically the sensitivity of lithosphere stability to melt-induced weakening in apostcollisional lithosphere. Our models show that partial melting of the lowermost crust—caused by theincreased geotherm by convective thinning of the lithosphere and sublithospheric SSC underneath it—canlead to positive feedback by melt weakening and to the foundering of the whole lithospheric mantle in to theasthenosphere, leading to mantle- and crust-derived late-orogenic magmatic activity.This process explains the generation of those granite-migmatite zones that show long-lived partial meltingof the crust followed by extensive plutonism and intervening mantle-derived magmatism. Furthermore, itprovides an explanation for the observed relationships between asthenospheric upwelling, extension, andorogenic collapse following crustal anatexis: the orogenic collapse need not to be driven by the astheno-spheric upwelling or the partial melts in the crust formed during the collision. Instead, thinning of thethickened orogenic lithosphere is enhanced by fluids in the asthenosphere, subducted during and before thecollision, leading to increased geotherm and partial melting of the lower crust. Partial melts weaken the litho-sphere and drive further thinning, and thus further melting. This positive feedback causes loss of lithosphericmantle and extensive crustal melting, both of which drive orogenic collapse. Progressive removal of the litho-spheric mantle provides a heat source for the crustal anatexis, and simultaneously explains the generation oflate-orogenic mantle-derived magmas.Underplating of mantle-derived melts below the crust is found to increase initial crustal melting rates, but tohave a close-to-neutral effect in overall crustal melting on timescales of the whole collision and postcollisionalrelaxation. The source regions of these underplating melts become refractory and form a high-viscosity layerthat inhibits further mantle melting and brings lithosphere foundering to a halt.ReferencesAnnen, C., & Sparks, R.

invasional meltdown hypothesis,52740745,Rock-and-soil avalanches: Theory and simulation,10.1029/2008JF001072,"Taboada, Alfredo, Estrada, Nicolas",2009,"International audienceWe present a 2-D Contact Dynamics discrete element model for simulating initiation and motion of rock avalanches, integrating hillslope geometry, Mohr-Coulomb rock behavior, pore pressure before avalanche triggering, and avalanche trigger. Avalanche motion is modeled as a dense granular flow of dry frictional and cohesive particles. On the basis of granular physics and shear experiments, we review some of the theories for the unexpectedly long runout of rock avalanches. Different causes are evoked, according to the strength (strong or weak) of the slip surface relative to the bulk. """"Mechanical fluidization'' and """"acoustic fluidization'' theories state that agitation of rock particles reduces frictional strength, increasing runout. Conversely, granular mechanics suggests that, as """"shear-strain'' rate increases, granular material becomes more agitated, more dissipative, and more resistant. Another theory states that dynamic fragmentation of clasts creates an isotropic pressure that drives longer runout. In contrast, granular mechanics suggests that fragmentation may induce fluidization and strengthening of the granular material, while particle size reduction (among others) induces weakening of the granular flow and enhances long runout. Runout is also enhanced for column-like rock masses collapsing from steep hillslopes. Long runout may also be linked to thermal weakening mechanisms at the slip surface (e.g., thermal pressurization, and shear melting), which may lower drastically the shear strength. The model is illustrated with a hypothetical example of a rain-triggered avalanche, mobilizing shallowly dipping layers. Several phases are identified, including slope failure, avalanche triggering resulting from slip weakening, and avalanche motion in which rocks are folded and sheared",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/article, Journal articles","LONG-RUNOUT LANDSLIDES, GRANULAR-MATERIALS, JIUFENGERSHAN LANDSLIDE, HILLSLOPE EVOLUTION, FLUID PRESSURE, EARTHQUAKE, FRICTION, FLOWS, DYNAMICS, TAIWAN, [SDU.STU.GP]Sciences of the Universe [physics]/Earth Sciences/Geophysics [physics.geo-ph], [PHYS.PHYS.PHYS-GEO-PH]Physics [physics]/Physics [physics]/Geophysics [physics.geo-ph], [SDE.MCG]Environmental Sciences/Global Changes",,'American Geophysical Union (AGU)'
invasional meltdown hypothesis,45905205,The mutational meltdown in asexual populations,,"Lynch, M., Bürger, R., Butcher, D., Gabriel, W.",1993,"Loss of fitness due to the accumulation of deleterious mutations appears to be inevitable in small, obligately asexual populations, as these ate incapable of reconstituting highly fit genotypes by recombination or back mutation. The cumulative buildup of such mutations is expected to lead to an eventual reduction in population size, and this facilitates the chance accumulation of future mutations. This synergistic interaction between population size reduction and mutation accumulation leads to an extinction process known as the mutational meltdown, and provides a powerful explanation for the rarity of obligate asexuality. We give an overview of the theory of the mutational meltdown, showing how the process depends on the demographic properties of a population, the properties of mutations, and the relationship between fitness and number of mutations incurred",,info:eu-repo/semantics/article,,,

For iron (Fe) and gabbroic anorthosite (An) impactors most of the kinetic energy of the meteoroid is converted into internal energy residing in  the planetary surf ace material. The fraction of meteoroid kinetic energy transformed into internal energy ranges from 0.70 at 5 km/sec to 0.85 at 30 km/sec for an An → An impact, and 0.74-0.91 at these same speeds for an Fe → An impact. At low velocities (for both cases) much of the internal energy (approximately 0.5 at 5 km/sec) is produced by the plastic work resulting from a finite yield strength of the rock whereas the balance of the internal energy results largely from shock heating. The relative fraction of the impact energy residing in the kinetic energy of the planetary surface ranges from 0.1 to 0.07 for the An → An impacts and 0.09-0.07 for the Fe → An impacts. Most of this  energy resides in the ejecta. Our results imply that the energy consumed by plastic work in strong rocks is available for conversion to kinetic energy in weak rocks and thus can increase the amount of ejecta for impact into weak rocks and unconsolidated regoliths. The degree of melting and vaporization produced by impact was calculated by constructing the isentropes, passing through the energy and volume states at 1 atm pressure, that correspond to  incipient and complete melting and vaporization. The amount of melt for an An → An impact ranged from approximately 1.5 times the meteoroid volume at 7.5 km/sec to 102 times the meteoroid volume at 45 km/sec; for an Fe → An impact the volume ranged from approximately 5 times the meteoroid  volume at 7.5 km/sec to over 250 times the meteoroid volume at 45 km/sec. The use of a similarity variable (which is related to the physical properties of both the projectile and target) allows the relative volumes of melt and the condensed volumes of vaporized materials to be plotted on a single curve. For high impact velocities the relative masses of melted and vaporized material are found to  be proportional to impactor kinetic energy and the mass of impact melt exceeds the mass of vaporized material by a factor of 6. From the observed dependence of crater diameter, D, on impact energy and planetary surface gravity we infer the volume of melt relative to the volume of the crater would increase with crater diameter at least as rapidly as D^(0.55). This predicted relative increase in  melting with crater diameter is observed in terrestrial and inferred to occur in lunar craters. The results also predict that the amount of melt for a given crater diameter is greater for planets that have higher values of surface gravity. This implies that more melt will be observed in large terrestrial craters than similar-sized lunar craters",,"Book Section, PeerReviewed",,,Pergamon Press

In particular we study the emplacement mechanisms responsible for formation of Continental Flood Basalts. The models show that the dynamics of melt upwelling and distribution and the surface topography are all sensitive to the boundary conditions and the rheological stratification. When melt is involved, there is no or little stretching at break-up time of the continental lithosphere. Depending on the boundary conditions, zones of reduced strength and soft magma pockets localize strain and create focussed or segmented zones of significant weakening and fracturing. When extension of the lithosphere is fast and steady, magmatism is segmented in spaced fissures. In contrast, when extension is slow or episodic, focussing of magmatism and fracturing is the preferred mode of melt emplacement. Upon fracturing of the brittle layer, the melt extrudes to the surface as lava flows. Buoyancy is the dominant mechanism by which magma is transported in the ductile lower crust and upper mantle. In contrast, dykes provide the means by which basaltic melts migrate through the brittle part of the lithosphere. Such spectacular intrusions are likely to have fed Continental Flood Basalts. The model results show that buoyant rise and focusing of magma, originating from a plume or a lithospheric source undergoing slow and/or episodic extension might provide a mechanical explanation for the profuse volcanism of Continental Flood Basalts, at break up time of the continental lithosphere e.g. the Ethiopian Trap Basalts.

S., Marion, C., Sylvester, P.",2008,"Impact cratering is an important geological process on the terrestrial planets and rocky and icy moons of the outer solar system. Impact events generate pressures and temperatures that can melt a substantial volume of the target; however, there remains considerable discussion as to the effect of target lithology on the generation of impact melts. Early studies showed that for impacts into crystalline targets, coherent impact melt rocks or sheets are formed with these rocks often displaying classic igneous structures (e.g., columnar jointing) and textures. For impact structures containing some amount of sedimentary rocks in the target sequence, a wide range of impactgenerated lithologies have been described, although it has generally been suggested that impact melt is either lacking or is volumetrically minor. This is surprising given theoretical constraints, which show that as much melt should be produced during impacts into sedimentary targets. The question then arises: where has all the melt gone? The goal of this synthesis is to explore the effect of target lithology on the products of impact melting. A comparative study of the similarly sized Haughton, Mistastin, and Ries impact structures, suggests that the fundamental processes of impact melting are basically the same in sedimentary and crystalline targets, regardless of target properties. Furthermore, using advanced microbeam analytical techniques, it is apparent that, for the structures under consideration here, a large proportion of the melt is retained within the crater (as crater-fill impactites) for impacts into sedimentary-bearing target rocks. Thus, it is suggested that the basic products are genetically equivalent but they just appear different. That is, it is the textural, chemical and physical properties of the products that vary.The Meteoritics & Planetary Science archives are made available by the Meteoritical Society and the University of Arizona Libraries.

invasional meltdown hypothesis,187331544,Compaction in a mantle with a very small melt concentration: Implications for the generation of carbonatitic and carbonate-bearing high alkaline mafic melt impregnations,,"Rabinowicz, M., Ricard, Y., Grégoire, M.",2002,"cited By 28Xenoliths entrained in alkaline basalts and kimberlites give strong evidence that mantle carbonatitic and carbonated high alkaline mafic silicate melts, which are initially produced at very low degrees of partial melting (≪1%), percolate and accumulate to form impregnations with a melt concentration of up to 10%. At present no compaction model has explained such huge local amplification of melt concentration. Recently, Bercovici et al. [1] have shown that the commonly used equations of compaction are not sufficiently general to describe all melt percolation processes the mantle. In particular, they show that, when the melt concentration in the mantle is very low, the pressure jump ΔP between the solid and liquid fractions of the mantle mush is very important and plays a driving role during compaction. 1-D compaction waves generated with two different systems of equations are computed. Three types of wave-trains are observed, i.e. (1) sinusoidal waves; (2) periodic waves with flat minima and very acute maxima (‘witch hat waves’); (3) periodic solitary waves with flat maxima and extremely narrow minima (‘bowler hat waves’). When the initial melt distribution in the mantle is quite homogeneous, the compaction waves have sinusoidal shapes and can locally amplify the melt concentration by a factor less than two. When there is a drastic obstruction at the top of the wetted domain, the pressure jump ΔP between solid and liquid controls the shape of the waves. If the computation assumes the equality of pressure between the two phases (ΔP=0), the compaction wave has a ‘bowler hat shape’, and locally amplifies the melt concentration by a factor less than 5. Alternatively, simulations taking into account the pressure jump between phases ΔP predict compaction waves with ‗witch hat shape’. These waves collect a large quantity of melt promoting the development of magmons with local melt concentration exceeding 100× the background melt concentration. It is inferred that in a mantle with very low concentrations of carbonatitic or high alkaline mafic silicate melt the magmons are about 1 km thick and reach, in less than 1 Ma, a melt concentration of about 10%. The magmons are likely generated below the lithosphere at some distance away from the center of hot spots. This can explain the development of mantle carbonatitic eruptions in the African rift and the carbonatite and high alkaline mafic silicate volcanic activity in oceanic islands. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Subsequently, melted core materials (i.e.; corium) could migrate downward and impinge upon the lower head of the reactor pressure vessel (RPV). During this relocation, the complexity of the reactor structure could segregate the molten corium into various flow paths. A perforated flow plate could readily provide the mechanism to segregate the molten corium. The resulting small (a few cm) diameter melt streams, driven by gravity, could then penetrate the remaining coolant in the RPV and cause any of the following events: impingement of the high temperature melt streams on the lower head could breach the RPV; re-agglomeration of the corium melt on the lower head could influence the coolability of the debris bed; {open_quotes}pre-mixing{close_quotes} of the melt streams with the coolant could lead to a vapor explosion; or, sufficient quenching of the melt streams by the coolant could produce a stabilized debris bed. An overview of the thermo-science issues related to core-melt accidents is presented by Theofanous. Thus, insight into the melt stream breakup mechanisms (i.e.; interfacial conditions, fragmentation, and geometric spacing) during the melt-coolant interactions is necessary to evaluate the plausibility, and characteristics, of these events. Molten Fuel Stream Breakup Simulation (MFSBS) experiments have been performed at Argonne National Laboratory in which simulant materials were used to determine a `boiling` jet breakup length correlation and to visualize the melt fragmentation mechanisms during the penetration of a single molten metal jet into a volatile liquid. The goal was to characterize the hydrodynamics of the corium-water interactions in a postulated core melt accident.

A., White, Richard W., Hudson, Timothy J. M.",2014,"Ascent of granitic melt initiates under suprasolidus conditions in the mid- to lower crust before continuing through subsolidus rocks to higher crustal levels. Whereas migration of melt in suprasolidus rocks can occur in pervasive net-like structures and involve relatively small melt volumes, ascent through the subsolidus crust requires more focused, dyke-like structures and larger volumes to prevent freezing. Migmatites in the Aus granulite terrain, southern Namibia, preserve evidence that large-scale melt redistribution and accumulation occurred in the near-source region under suprasolidus conditions. Melt that was mainly produced in metapelitic rocks utilised pervasive small-scale leucosome networks to migrate to areas surrounding pre-tectonic granite sheets. These areas are dominated by metapsammitic rocks, and abundant and voluminous leucogranite sheets attest to melt accumulation and residence occurring over a protracted period while the area was undergoing anatexis. However, the leucogranites have an anhydrous mineralogy and the surrounding rocks only preserve evidence for limited, high-temperature retrogression, consistent with substantial melt loss from the accumulation structures. We speculate that melt batches leaving the accumulation sites are likely to have been large, allowing for substantially more efficient ascent through subsolidus crust. Our results suggest that a degree of near-source melt accumulation is likely to occur during the early stages of meltmigration, and that this can significantly enhance the effectiveness of subsequent melt ascent (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Magma transport and the compensating matrix deformation are commonly described by two-phase compaction models, but melt production is less often incorporated. Melting is driven by the necessity to maintain thermodynamic equilibrium between mineral grains in the partial melt; the position and amount of partial melting that occur are thus thermodynamically determined. We present a consistent model for the ascent of a one-dimensional column of rock and provide solutions that reveal where and how much partial melting occurs, the positions of the boundaries of the partial melt being determined by conserving energy across them. Thermodynamic equilibrium of the boundary between partial melt and the solid lithosphere requires a boundary condition on the effective pressure (solid pressure minus melt pressure), which suggests that large effective stresses, and hence fracture, are likely to occur near the base of the lithosphere. Matrix compaction, melt separation and temperature in the partially molten region are all dependent on the effective pressure, a fact that can lead to interesting oscillatory boundary-layer structures. © 2008 The Royal Society",,"Published, Journal article","partial melting, compaction, magma migration, mid-ocean ridges, free boundary",Proceedings of the Royal Society A Mathematical Physical and Engineering Sciences,'The Royal Society'

Multiple intrusions would seem more consistent with pulses of endogenous magmatism rather than a one-shot impact event although the mechanics of large- scale impact melting remain obscure. Amphibole is present in the SIC norite and may be primary [10]. The presence of water in the melt in amounts necessary to stabilize amphibole (2-5 wt%) may be more consistent with an endogenous magma rather than a super- heated impact melt. For example, tektites are among the driest of terrestrial rocks, but their small volume may not be directly analo- gous to the SIC. It may also be possible that a dry impact melt became hydrated through assimilation of country rock during crystallization. The bulk composition of the SIC seems to be close to mat of an average for the upper crustal target stratigraphy [1], which is a common characteristic of terrestrial impact melts. However, endo- genous magmatic processes such as assimilation can incorporate significant amounts of continental crust into more mafic magmas without superheat [17,18]. Such processes can produce igneous rocks with compositional characteristics quite similar to that esti- mated for the bulk composition of the SIC. For example, many occurrences of Cenozoic volcanic rocks in western North America have bulk compositions close to that of the SIC [19-22]. Even if the SIC is not a direct impact melt, there does appear to be a close association in space and time between the SIC and a major impact event Dietz [23] and French [24] described features in the Sudbury Basin that they attributed to shock. Their arguments that the Basin is an impact structure are persuasive because there are no known occurrences of similar shock features unequivocally associ- ated with volcanic eruptions. If the Sudbury Basin is an impact structure, it is the largest such structure known on Earth. The noncirculari ty of the SB has been cited as evidence against an impact origin, although the original shape of the Basin is poorly constrained [25]. Although die original shapes of most impact craters generally are circular, considerable variation in crater outline and morphol- ogy can be found. Oblique impacts can produce craters with elongate outlines, as observed on the Moon and Mars [26-29]. An oblique, skipping impact event that created a series of elongated scars was discovered recently in Peru [30]. Fragmentation of the impactor can produce elongated, noncircular crater patterns or multiple events as shown by the Henbury cluster, the Cape York meteorite field, and the East-West Clearwater pair. Erosion and deformation can alter the original shape of an impact basin, e.g., MeteorCrater is somewhat rectangular. The apparent noncircularity of the Sudbury crater is not a strong argument against an impact origin when stacked against the host of shock features clearly associated with the Basin. Even if the SIC is an endogenously produced magma and not an impact melt, the association of impact events and magmatism may nonetheless have important implications when considering the locus and style of planetary magmatism. The close correspondence in space and time between the impact event and the magmatism that produced the SIC suggests a broadly genetic connection, especial- ly considering the overall paucity of magmatism of similar age (18SO Ma) in the region [31,32]. In order to explain the composi- tional characteristics of the SIC, it appears necessary to invoke significant mixing of mantle-derived magmas with continental crust. Spatial variations in mineral compositions away from wall rock contacts suggest that the melt was actively assimilating wall rock [ 10]. In tracra ter melt rocks or breccias may have been assimi- latcd by more mafic magmas, which in turn may have been produced by local thermal perturbations or pressure-release melting associ- ated with the impact. Alternatively, crustal material may have been injected into die mantle, producing a mixed source that melted to give the SIC parent magma. Nyquist and Shih [33] have proposed that regional hetero- geneities in die lunar mantle may reflect large impact events that injected crustal material deep into the Moon's interior. The SIC appears to represent endogenous magmatism although probably localized and influenced by a major impact event and structure. The role of pristine lunar highland rocks as products of endogenous magmatism is correspondingly secure for die moment but the effects of major impact events in localizing and influencing that magmatism remains poorly perceived and probably requires additional missions to die Moon to clarify. Regardless, study of impact events remains of fundamental importance for understand- ing die formation and evolution of die planets. References: [l]Grieveetal.(1991)./G/?,96.22753.

Here Hm is the melt enthalpy (~10'° erg/g), and Hn is the enthalpy required to negate the planet's strength (-10MO* erg/g). The crater morphological regimes have been described as simple bowl-shaped, flat-floored, multiple-ringed, central peak, and cen- tral pit [2]. In the case of simple bowl-shaped craters, the strength of the planet arrests the growth of the crater and is the dominant factor in its shape (Fig. 1). In all the other regimes, gravity arrests the growth and results in a rebounding of the depth and a collapse and propagation of the crater lip (Fig. 2). Multiple rings, peaks, and pits evolve after the rebounding and collapse and are a result of (he interplay between the gravitational and strength forces (Fig. 3). The planetary strength is altered by the impact process. The strong shock wave melts, thermally weakens, and fractures the planetary mate- rial. We have modeled the melting and thermal weakening and Asphaung ct al. [3] are addressing fracturing. We have determined the consequences of these effects on crater morphology scaling using the formalism of Holsapple and Schmidt [4]. Using die result of calculations, we determine the melt layer thickness/crater diam- eter (TJd) for simple and complex bowl-shaped craters. From numerical calculations, we find for simple craters that die quantity TJd is dependent only upon the material properties and scales as [ Y/CprLj]*2* (Fig. Ib).

In addition to the melt layer thickness, we determined the scaling of the depth and total amount of melting for each of the entering regimes.

invasional meltdown hypothesis,103694548,Phase equilibria trigger for explosive volcanic eruptions,,"Sarah J. Fowler, Frank J. Spera",2008,"[1] A mechanism for explosive volcanic eruptions based on multicomponent phase equilibria modelling of four explosive volcanic systems is proposed. In each system, either isochoric or isobaric crystallization, where either crystals or crystals and exsolved fluid are chemically fractionated from melt, leads inevitably to near-solidus dynamical instability culminating in violent explosive eruption. Driving this instability is a dramatic increase in the volume fraction of fluid bubbles in the magma exceeding the limit for magma fragmentation. This phenomenon is independent of magma decompression. Country rock may be weak, allowing magma to remain in lithostatic equilibrium with its host rock, or strong, leading to divergence of magma and lithostatic pressure. Bubbles may be retained or expelled during crystallization. Instability is the inevitable outcome of crystallization at shallow levels in the crust for all four systems, regardless of the mechanical state of host country rock. We speculate that this phase equilibria mechanism driving explosive eruptions has general significance",,text,,,

R. S., Reimold, W. U., McDonald, Iain",2009,"This paper provides important insights into the generation, extraction and crystallization of clast-laden impact melt rocks from the Araguainha impact structure, central Brazil. Despite the mixed nature of the Araguainha target rocks (comprising a 2 km thick sequence of sedimentary rocks and underlying granitic basement), the exposed melt bodies are characterised by an alkali-rich granitic matrix embedding mineral and rock fragments derived only from the target granite. The melt rocks occur in the form of a massive impact melt sheet overlying the eroded central uplift structure, and as melt veins in the granite of the core of the central uplift. Bulk-rock major and trace element data (including platinum group elements) indicate that the precursor melts were generated locally, principally by partial melting of the target granite, without any contribution from the sedimentary sequence or the projectile. The dense network of melt veins was formed in isolation, by selective melting of plagioclase and alkali feldspar within the granite target. Plagioclase and alkali feldspar melted discretely and congruently, producing domains in the matrix of the melt veins, which closely match the stoichiometry of these minerals. The compositionally discrete initial melt phases migrated through a dense network of microfractures before being assembled into larger melt veins. Freezing of the melt veins was substantially fast, and the melt components were quenched in the form of alkali-feldspar and plagioclase schlieren in the matrix of the melt veins. The overlying impact melt rock is, in contrast, characterised by a granophyric matrix consisting of albite, sanidine, quartz, biotite and chlorite. In this case, melt components appear to have been more mobile and to have mixed completely to form a granitic parental melt. We relate the melting of the minerals to post-shock temperatures that exceeded the melting point of feldspars",,"QB, QE","QB, QE",,Elsevier

These solutions are extended to describe the melting of a mushy region in contact with a hot liquid. A significant feature of melting mushy regions is that the phase change occurs internally by dissolution. Our solutions for melting of a mushy region are used to investigate this internal phase change and are compared with the classical Neumann solutions for melting of a pure substance,,,,,'Elsevier BV'

Based on prior laboratory observations of molten-metal/water interactions, fragmentation of the molten material is a necessary ingredient for the occurrence of an explosive incident. An analytical model is developed to describe the sequence of events associated with a hot molten sphere falling into a cool liquid, when a vapor blanket instantaneously surrounds the sphere. Energy and momentum considerations for each of the coupled regions (the molten-metal sphere, the vapor shell and the surrounding liquid coolant) provide the transient growth of the vapor-film thickness and the temperature distribution in the liquid coolant. When the vapor film collapses, the molten-metal/liquid- coolant contact is initially a point rather than the entire vapor shell collapsing instantaneously. When the vapor film collapses locally, the liquid coolant is described by a semiinfinite model. The resulting limit-of-superheat temperature determination shows that the proposed limit-of-superheat explanation for the vapor explosion is inappropriate. Based on the predictions of the model, the mechanism of fragmentation of the molten material appears to result from cavitation following the rapid cooling associated with collapse of the vapor film.Mechanical Engineering, Department o",,"Thesis, Text",,,

invasional meltdown hypothesis,217047551,"Fractal Analysis and Thermal-Elastic Modeling of a Subvolcanic Magmatic Breccia: The Shatter Zone, Mount Desert Island, Maine",,"Roy, Samuel Geoffrey",2011,"The Shatter Zone of Mount Desert Island, Maine, is a 450-1000m thick  magmatic breccia that defines the perimeter of the Cadillac Mountain  Intrusive Complex. The 400 Ma complex consists of gabbro-diorite sheets  overlain by three different granites, the largest of which is an A-type  granite emplaced at high temperature (~900oC) and at shallow crustal  depth (\u3c5km), having fed numerous volcanic eruptions, the products of  which are exposed on the nearby Cranberry Islands. Results from a  contact metamorphism numerical model show that development of the  intrusive complex occurred incrementally, with multiple sequences of  magma emplacement with bimodal composition. Metamorphism continued prior  to wall rock fragmentation and injection of granitic magma. The Shatter  Zone formed during a large volcanic eruption triggered by continued  emplacement of mafic magma, resulting in elastic failure of the  metasedimentary and diorite wall rock and virtually instantaneous  fragmentation and entrainment of the clasts in hot granitic magma. The  degree of brecciation is gradational, with clast supported breccias at  the outer margin of the zone grading inward to granitic-matrix supported  breccia, and finally into clast-free Cadillac Mountain Granite. Field  observations point to an explosive breccia mechanism, and clast size  distribution analysis yields fractal dimensions (Ds \u3e 3) that agree  with those known to result from explosion (Ds \u3e 2.5). Field and  microstructural data and observations suggest that the clast sizes and  shapes of the metasedimentary host rocks reflect post-brecciation  modification by partial melting and thermal fracture, while diorite dike  fragments experienced little modification after the original  brecciation event. Clast circularity increases with proximity to the  magma reservoir, whereas clast boundary shape decreases; this implies  thermal wear on clast surfaces. Numerical modeling is employed to  explore the possible thermalmechanical effects on the size distribution  of clasts. Instantaneous immersion is assumed for metasedimentary clasts  (650°C) in a hot granitic matrix (800°C - 900°C), and our thermal  analysis is restricted to conductive heat transfer corrected for latent  heat. The amount of clast melt is primarily dependent on the melt  temperature of the clast, the matrix to clast volume ratio, and the  initial magma intrusion and clast temperatures. Results show that  thermal fracture and clast melt were viable secondary modification  processes, and magma flow was necessary for disaggregation of melted  clasts to occur. Angular clasts are highly susceptible to corner  break-off owing to large tensile stresses associated with thermal shock.  Considering the effects of these processes on clast size distribution,  we conclude that the Shatter Zone formed from explosion, and latestage  magma emplacement effectively altered the size and shape for many of the  metasedimentary clasts",,text,"Breccia, Ingeous rocks, Earth Sciences, Geology, Physical Sciences and Mathematics",,DigitalCommons@UMaine

Introduction There are many infectious illnesses in this area that have not been successfully eliminated by the state or society for a lengthy period of time. If the local government does not intervene, infectious illnesses can take a long time to spread from village to village, especially if there is a lack of awareness and education in the affected region.  A piece of land that is smaller than a continent but larger than a reef and completely encircled by water is referred to be an island (Dawson, 2016). The island is a shared property with numerous resources. The island has a number of health issues that might lead to an endemic sickness.  Disease that is endemic to a certain location or population is known as a pandemic. People in poor nations are more vulnerable to the effects of endemic illnesses. Other factors include uneven growth, as well as difficult-to-reach preventative and treatment strategies.  International health organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) are working to improve access to healthcare for people with endemic illnesses across the world, including in Indonesia.  To deal with and manage endemic illnesses, the government has implemented a number of measures through the Ministry of Health. The government, for example, has subsidized the 3M Plus Mosquito Nest Eradication (PSN) and the Jumantik 1 House 1 Movement in order to prevent dengue virus from spreading. Malaria prophylaxis, including the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets, repellents, and prophylactic medication, is part of the government's ongoing socialization and counseling efforts aimed at preventing malaria transmission (Monroe, 2020). After that, the government implemented the Filariasis Elimination Program, a plan to distribute mass-prevention medications for filariasis in several hotspots.  Health facilities and integrated service posts in Indonesia are now being targeted for outreach activities to promote and prevent the spread of endemic illnesses, rather than simply providing access to drugs. An educational and awareness-building effort is the primary goal of this program. To keep endemic illnesses from spreading and becoming widespread, the entire community must join together to lend a hand. We hope to learn more about the environmental features and disease endemicity of the major islands in order to better understand the causes of disease endemicity.  JOURNAL LA LIFESCI  VOL. 02, ISSUE 06 (013-017), 2022 DOI: 10.37899/journallalifesci.v2i6.540      14 ISSN 2721-1304 (Print), ISSN 2721-1207 (online) Copyright © 2022, Journal La Lifesci, Under the license CC BY-SA 4.0 Literature Review Causative factor Malaria Anopheles spp insects spread due to the presence of puddles of water, which mosquitoes use to lay eggs, hatch into larvae, and develop into pupae before becoming adult mosquitoes. Each Anopheles spp. breeds in a distinct environment depending on where it lives (Sukowati, 2008) While buffalo puddles have the greatest salinity (2 ppm), standing water (13 locations) is the most prevalent breeding habitat type, the water in as many as 15 locations is murky, and only 5 locations are shaded. The majority of these locations are also exposed to direct sunshine.  Many varieties of flora and animals were found in the water including mosses and rice plants, as well as tin head fish, water hyacinth and grass and moss in the rivers, rice fields, lakes and buffalo puddles. The salt level of the breeding habitat discovered on Sumba Island ranges from 0-2 this implies that the breeding habitat is mainly fresh water and brackish water. spp. normally live with a salinity of 0% in fresh water and 0-7% in brackish water.  At water salinity levels as low as 7.5ppm, An. sundaicus is the most common mosquito species on Sumba Island, and it may thrive in coastal locations with an altitude of between 0 and 40 dpl. According to hourly fluctuations in the number of anopheline species, the density begins to grow after midnight when most people begin taking naps.  More than 60.46 percent of Anopheles' resting activity occurred outside the home or around the cage (Table 2). For the most part, An. sundaicus was discovered resting in houses and walls, whereas An. annular was the least frequent species to be found there. However, An. kochi was not observed biting or resting in the home. According to this information, after sucking blood, mosquitoes would spend longer time outside before searching for a place to lay their eggs and reproduce. DHF (Dengue Fever) Rainwater plays a critical role in the supply of clean water in coastal areas. Keeping rainwater in barrels that aren't sealed might allow mosquitoes to breed there. According to the findings, the community's attitude was not positive. Many containers aren't closed, and individuals are draining water reservoirs, resulting in a large amount of water being squandered. In addition, because the Ae aegypti mosquito transmits dengue fever, living in close quarters makes it easier for the disease to spread. Because of their propensity to bite several people at once, mosquitoes have an easier time spreading dengue fever in highly populated residential areas.  Larval mosquitoes can transmit the dengue virus as they mature into adult mosquitoes that are capable of carrying the virus, which is why their presence has been linked to an increased risk of DHF. Dengue fever is not directly tied to the characteristics of the plank house or wall home, but the type of house that is damp, dark, and has a large number of holes without wire mesh will make it easier for mosquitoes to enter the house and spread disease. On the basis of female mosquitoes' tendency of searching for victims at night, the Indonesian Ministry of Health (2007) claims. The house is a hive of activity. Ae aegypti is known for persistently sucking blood (multiple bites).  Dengue fever is more likely to spread due to people's tendency to move about (Wong & AbuBakar, 2013). It is common for dengue fever to spread from one person to another by tracking the movement of people within a community. Dengue fever is more likely to spread in densely populated areas, such as coastal buffer zones, where the majority of individuals commute to and from their places of employment each day.     15 ISSN 2721-1304 (Print), ISSN 2721-1207 (online) Copyright © 2022, Journal La Lifesci, Under the license CC BY-SA 4.0 Filariasis The location of filariasis patients and the transmission chain are heavily influenced by the environment. Climate, geography, geological features, temperature, humidity, and so on are all examples of the physical environment. The development of filariasis transmission vectors is influenced by the physical environment, which is intertwined with vector life (Tabachnick, 2010). Mosquitoes can breed and relax in the physical surroundings. The spread of B. malayi, a sub-periodic nocturnal and periodic pathogen, is hampered by the existence of reservoir hosts (apes, langurs, and cats) and marshy vegetation. It is possible that the biological environment contributes to filariasis transmission. Aquatic plants, puddles, marshes, and shrubs are examples of the biological environment because they serve as breeding grounds for the Mansonia spp mosquito. Many plants, such as mangroves, mosses and algae, can have an impact on the larvae's survival by obstructing sunlight or protecting them from predators.  Mosquitoes typically have a flying range of between 0.5 and 1 kilometer. Humans who live in close proximity to puddles are at an increased risk of contracting filariasis because the mosquitoes that transmit filariasis are more easily accessible to them. Because they are shielded from sunshine and humidity, shrubs, cow pens, and hanging garments are ideal resting spots for mosquitoes before and after coming into contact with humans. Aside from their affinity for human and animal blood, certain mosquitoes are also known as zoophiles and anthropophiles. Filariasis transmission can occur in areas where there are shrubs, cattle pens, and garments hanging on hooks.  Among the many ways plants influence mosquito life is as a place to lay eggs, a place to hide from predators, a place for larvae to feed and a place for adults to rest until the gonotropic cycle begins. Another factor that helps predict the prevalence of mosquitoes is the availability of different types of plants in an area. Kodi Many aquatic plants, including as moss, algae, and other weeds, have taken up residence in the Balaghar Sub-District. There are a lot of mosquito larvae in this area because of the abundance of these plants. Health Aspect The archipelago has a wide range of health issues due to a variety of environmental causes. According to the journals we obtained, coastal and island environments are home to three distinct forms of illnesses. Each of these conditions is brought on by a parasite.  Mansonia, Culex, and Armigeres mosquitoes are the primary vectors of filarial worm infections that cause elephant foot disease (EFD). Inflammation of the ducts and lymph nodes, as well as recurring fever, are the most common acute clinical symptoms of the worms' presence in these organs (Gecse & Vermeire, 2018). Excessive growth in the arms, legs, breasts, and genital organs can be permanently disabling at an advanced level. Because this condition can lead to long-term disabilities that make the patient unable to work, they become a burden on their families and society, as well.  Plasmodium protozoa produce malaria, an acute infectious illness that is transmitted by mosquitoes (Paul et al., 2002). The female Anopheles mosquito bite is the vector for the transmission of this parasite. P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. Malaria are the four species that cause malaria in humans. Female Anopheles mosquitoes are responsible for the spontaneous transmission of malaria parasites. Infectious malaria can manifest as an acute or long-term infection. Plasmodium asexualis enters the human body and is spread by female Anopheles mosquitoes, which carry the illness. An erythrocyte-parasitic illness, malaria is marked by the detection of asexual forms of Plasmodium in the blood. Anemia, chills, and splenomegaly are all symptoms of malaria infection. It can be either acute or long-term.    16 ISSN 2721-1304 (Print), ISSN 2721-1207 (online) Copyright © 2022, Journal La Lifesci, Under the license CC BY-SA 4.0 Infection with malaria can be mild or develop systemic consequences, which is described as """"severe malaria."""" Malaria infection. A babesiosa infection, which results in babesiosis, is a parasite illness that resembles malaria (Sudoyo, et al 2006).  Indigenous occurrences are observed to be endemic in numerous Indonesian archipelagic locations. Tidore is home to one of them. If indigenous instances are still detected, the potential for becoming an area of elimination is thwarted. Indigenous is a localized illness. No indigenous transmission of malaria has been observed in the region designated as a malaria-free zone. (Health Department of Tidore, 2016) Activities to strengthen the Early Alert System/SKD can help keep the Akelamo Health Center's operating area free of indigenous illnesses. The Mass Blood Survey, a community-wide effort to collect blood samples for the purpose of identifying the malaria parasite, is one activity that might help enhance the Early Awareness System for puskesmas. The solution  The goal of filariasis control is to disrupt the transmission chain. Environmental biodiversity and area geography and biological mosquitoes and reservoirs factors, as well as response behavior and attitudes, all play a role in breaking the transmission cycle (Sylvie et al., 2008). Therefore, the entire community must take an active part to guarantee that there are no more vector breeding access points by preventing the creation of puddles.  DHF incidences in Tarakan were exacerbated by the absence of potable water in the neighborhood. As a result, coastal populations' access to safe drinking water is highly reliant on rainfall. Keeping rainwater in barrels that aren't sealed might allow mosquitoes to breed there. Because of this, the 3M program must be included into the overall community structure.  Malaria vectors and their breeding habitats have been discovered in several Indonesian islands and coastal areas, so efforts must be made to eliminate breeding sites by stockpiling or draining puddles of water, using insect repellent, and wearing long clothes when engaging in outdoor activities to prevent the transmission of malaria to others. Conclusion Mosquitoes can reproduce in unfavorable environmental conditions, such as the presence of disease agents conveyed by water media, which can lead to the emergence of endemic illnesses such as malaria and dengue fever.

Using the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources Red List database for birds, mammals, and amphibians and the Invasive Species Specialist Group global invasive species database as sources of information, we developed a new indicator for the relative intrinsic vulnerability of islands to NIS. It was calculated from the residuals to the global relationship between the impact of NIS and their exposure to the islands. The impact of NIS was expressed as the proportion of indigenous species threatened by NIS, and the exposure was the number of invasive NIS per number of native species. The residuals corresponded to the variability in impact, about 60%, that was not explained by exposure. The proportion of endemic species on the islands was positively correlated with the relative intrinsic vulnerability and explained about 60% of its variability. The robust relationship between endemism and intrinsic vulnerability reinforces the role of long-term isolation for the fate of island indigenous species to biological invasions and is useful in identifying vulnerable environments without having a specific invader in mind",,"contributiontojournal/article, info:eu-repo/semantics/article, text",Ecology,,'University of Chicago Press'

This allowed us to directly test the assumption that island species have small values of Ne. We found that island species had significantly less genetic diversity than mainland species; however, this pattern could be attributed to a subset of island species that appeared to have undergone a recent population bottleneck. When these species were excluded from the analysis, island and mainland species had similar levels of genetic diversity, despite island species occupying considerably smaller areas than their mainland counterparts.

island susceptibility hypothesis,541016526,A few words about the sensitivity of island communities,,"Jedrusik, M.",2016,"For a long time, islands have served as the focal point for the studies of numerous researchers, who have been treating them as research laboratories. Their closed-off worlds created by the significant water barrier have caused their evolution to progress differently than on continental land. The isolation has produced endemism, relicts, and ecological niches, which made the islands very sensitive to the external hazards related to the introduction of foreign species. The world 's history is full of examples of such ecological catastrophes and scientific history contains numerous descriptions of them. If the entire animate nature - the flora and the fauna - was endangered, why would the islanders have it any different? Meanwhile, there is much less information concerning the fates of the isolated island communities, which experienced just as dramatic effects resulting from their contacts with foreign arrivals. This study aims to present such relatively recent episodes in the world's history. The article contains fragments and supplements of the thesis previously proposed in M. Jędrusik's book entitled """"Wyspy tropikalne. W poszukiwaniu dobrobytu (Tropical Islands. In Search of Prosperity)"""" (2005). The presented examples from various islands in Oceania confirm the dramatic effects of contacts between the natives and the migrants as well as the diverse resistance of various island populations, which depend on the historical population density of the given regions. It should be noted that limited demographic potential caused more difficulties to the rebuilding of the population than on the continents, thus considerably limiting the development of the territories experiencing this effect. However, the main cause of this hecatomb did not arise from the bad intentions of the arrivals, but the lack of biological immunity among the islanders. The predominantly white arrivals physically destroyed the erstwhile world of the natives, which was sometimes rather erroneously perceived as a distant paradise. The physical barrier between the islands and the continents - the ocean - may be still there, but these contacts made the """"immune"""" endemism of the islanders disappear.

The grammatical account posits that island effects result from syntactic constraints on wh-movement, whereas the resource-limitation view posits that low ratings emerge due to processing-related constraints on the parser, such that islands themselves present processing bottlenecks. The current study addresses this debate by investigating the relationship between island sensitivity and individual differences in cognitive abilities, as it has been argued that the two views make distinct predictions regarding whether a relationship should hold. Building directly on Sprouse et al. (2012a), we tested 102 native English speakers on 4 island types (whether, complex NP, subject, and adjunct islands) using an acceptability judgment task with wh-questions presented in context to quantify island sensitivity and three cognitive tasks to capture individual differences in working memory (via reading span and counting span task) and attentional control (via a number Stroop task).

It uses the trajectory of exposure and vulnerability (TEV) approach that it defines as ‘storylines of driving factors and processes that have influenced past and present territorial system exposure and vulnerability to impacts associated with climate variability and change.’ The study is based on the analysis of six peer-reviewed Pacific island case studies covering various geographical settings (high islands vs low-lying reef islands, urban vs rural) and hazards associated with climate variability and change; that addressed the interactions between natural and anthropogenic driving factors; and adopted multidecadal past-to-present approaches. The findings emphasize that most urban and rural reef and high islands have undergone increasing exposure and vulnerability as a result of major changes in settlement and demographic patterns, lifestyles and economies, natural resources availability, and environmental conditions. The article highlights three generic and successive periods of change in the studied islands’ TEV: from geopolitical and political over the colonization-to-political independence period; to demographic, socio-economic, and cultural from the 1960s to the 1980s; culminating in the dominance of demographic, socio-economic, cultural, and environmental drivers since the 1980s.

Reduced immune functions have been previously proposed to be part of this syndrome, as a consequence of the reduced diversity of pathogens on island ecosystems. According to this hypothesis, immune genes are expected to exhibit genomic signatures of relaxed selection pressure in island species. In this study, we used comparative genomic methods to study immune genes in island species (N = 20) and their mainland relatives (N = 14). We gathered public data as well as generated new data on innate (TLR: Toll-Like Receptors, BD: Beta Defensins) and acquired immune genes (MHC: Major Histocompatibility Complex classes I and II), but also on hundreds of genes with various immune functions. As a control, we used a set of 97 genes, not known to be involved in immune functions based on the literature, to account for the increased drift effects of the lower effective population sizes in island species. We used synonymous and non-synonymous variants to estimate the selection pressure acting on immune genes. We found that BDs and TLRs have higher ratios of non-synonymous over synonymous polymorphisms (Pn/Ps) than randomly selected control genes, suggesting that they evolve under a different selection regime. However, simulations show that this is unlikely to be explained by ongoing positive selection or balancing selection. For the MHC genes, which evolve under balancing selection, we used simulations to estimate the impact of population size variation. We found a significant effect of drift on immune genes of island species leading to a reduction in genetic diversity and efficacy of selection. However, the intensity of relaxed selection was not significantly different from control genes, except for MHC class II genes. These genes exhibit a significantly higher level of non-synonymous loss of polymorphism than expected assuming only drift and evolution under frequency dependent selection, possibly due to a reduction of extracellular parasite communities on islands. Overall, our results showed that demographic effects lead to a decrease in the immune functions of island species, but the relaxed selection that is expected to be caused by a reduced parasite pressure may only occur in some categories of immune genes",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/article, Journal articles",[SDV.BA]Life Sciences [q-bio]/Animal biology,,Peer Community In/Centre Mersenne

Some insular animals exhibit an ‘island syndrome,’ including increased susceptibility to disease, and some insular populations have declined when they failed to resist infection by introduced pathogens. I measured eight indices of immune function (haemolysis, haemagglutination, concentration of haptoglobin and concentration of five leukocyte types) in 15 phylogenetically matched pairs of bird populations from North America and from the islands of Hawaii, Bermuda and the Galápagos. Immune responses were not attenuated in insular birds, and several indices, including the concentration of plasma haptoglobin, were elevated. Thus, I find no support for the specific hypothesis that depauperate parasite communities and the costs of immune defences select for reduced immune function. Instead, I suggest that life on islands leads to an apparent reorganization of immune function, which is defined by increases in defences that are innate and inducible.

Likewise, there is high confidence that wave over-wash of seawater will degrade fresh groundwater resources {29.3.2} and that sea surface temperature rise will result in increased coral bleaching and reef degradation. {29.3.1.2} Given the dependence of island communities on coral reef ecosystems for a range of services including coastal protection, subsistence fisheries, and tourism, there is high confidence that coral reef ecosystem degradation will negatively impact island communities and livelihoods.Given the inherent physical characteristics of small islands, the AR5 reconfirms the high level of vulnerability of small islands to multiple stressors, both climate and non-climate (high confidence; robust evidence, high agreement). However, the distinction between observed and projected impacts of climate change is often not clear in the literature on small islands (high agreement). {29.3} There is evidence that this challenge can be partly overcome through improvements in baseline monitoring of island systems and downscaling of climate- model projections, which would heighten confidence in assessing recent and projected impacts. {WGI AR5 9.6; 29.3-4, 29.9}Small islands do not have uniform climate change risk profiles (high confidence). Rather, their high diversity in both physical and human attributes and their response to climate-related drivers means that climate change impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation will be variable from one island region to another and between countries in the same region. {Figure 29-1; Table 29-3} In the past, this diversity in potential response has not always been adequately integrated in adaptation planning.There is increasing recognition of the risks to small islands from climate-related processes originating well beyond the borders of an individual nation or island. Such transboundary processes already have a negative impact on small islands (high confidence; robust evidence, medium agreement). These include air-borne dust from the Sahara and Asia, distant-source ocean swells from mid to high latitudes, invasive plant and animal species, and the spread of aquatic pathogens. For island communities the risks associated with existing and future invasive species and human health challenges are projected to increase in a changing climate. {29.5.4}Adaptation to climate change generates larger benefit to small islands when delivered in conjunction with other development activities, such as disaster risk reduction and community-based approaches to development (medium confidence). {29.6.4} Addressing the critical social, economic, and environmental issues of the day, raising awareness, and communicating future risks to local communities {29.6.3} will likely increase human and environmental resilience to the longer term impacts of climate change. {29.6.1, 29.6.2.3; Figure 29-5}Adaptation and mitigation on small islands are not always trade-offs, but can be regarded as complementary components in the response to climate change (medium confidence). Examples of adaptation-mitigation interlinkages in small islands include energy supply and use, tourism infrastructure and activities, and functions and services associated with coastal wetlands. The alignment of these sectors for potential emission reductions, together with adaptation, offer co-benefits and opportunities in some small islands. {29.7.2, 29.8} Lessons learned from adaptation and mitigation experiences in one island may offer some guidance to other small island states, though there is low confidence in the success of wholesale transfer of adaptation and mitigation options when the local lenses through which they are viewed differ from one island state to the next, given the diverse cultural, socioeconomic, ecological, and political values. {29.6.2, 29.8}The ability of small islands to undertake adaptation and mitigation programs, and their effectiveness, can be substantially strengthened through appropriate assistance from the international community (medium confidence). However, caution is needed to ensure such assistance is not driving the climate change agenda in small islands, as there is a risk that critical challenges confronting island governments and communities may not be addressed. Opportunities for effective adaptation can be found by, for example, empowering communities and optimizing the benefits of local practices that have proven to be efficacious through time, and working synergistically to progress development agendas. {29.6.2.3, 29.6.3, 29.8",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/bookPart, Book sections","small islands, climate change, impacts, vulnerability, adaptation, [SDE]Environmental Sciences, [SHS]Humanities and Social Sciences",,'Cambridge University Press (CUP)'
island susceptibility hypothesis,519913059,On the vulnerability of Small Island Developing States: A dynamic analysis,,"Scandurra, G., Romano, A.A., Ronghi, M., Carfora, A.",2018,"Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are generally considered highly vulnerable to climate change because they suffer from most common environmental problems due to their smallness, remoteness and exposure to natural hazards, though they contribute less to climate change. However, international cooperation can improve the negative impacts of climate change by incentivizing adaptation policies. The vulnerability assessment becomes crucial because it can be used to allocate the international cooperation resources targeted to adaptation plans.  The aim of this paper is to assess of the vulnerability in Small Island Developing States.  Using a comprehensive dataset including 32 variables, we synthetize the vulnerability with a composite indicator. Then, we analyze the vulnerability’s dynamics over time from 2009 to 2014. Lastly, we explore the dimensions of vulnerability to assess those that have a greater weight on overall vulnerability. Our findings show that the vulnerability of Small Island Developing States is partly driven by common characteristics, such as isolation and extreme exposure to the effects of climate change, but the degree of vulnerability of identified dimensions is different among countries. Our results give indications to better target development aid, giving suggestions on the more relevant dimensions for action to reduce the vulnerability of each country",,text,"Vulnerability index, Small Island Developing States, Climate change, Adaptation policies, composite indicator, Terrestrial and Aquatic Ecology",,The Maritime Commons: Digital Repository of the World Maritime University

Despite recent focus on the geographical distribution of viruses and bacteria, the overall environmental distribution of human pathogens and parasites on Earth remains incompletely understood. As islands have long inspired basic ecological insights, we aimed to assess whether the microorganisms that cause human disease in modern times follow patterns common to insular plants and animals.Location Global and regional.Methods Relying on the publically accessible GIDEON database, we use the spatial distribution of nearly 300 human parasites and pathogens across 66 island countries and territories to assess the current predictive value of the 'equilibrium theory' of island biogeography. The relationships between species richness and (1) island surface area and (2) distance to the nearest mainland were investigated with linear regression, and ANCOVAs were used to test for differences in these relationships with respect to pathogen ecology and taxonomy.Results Pathogen species richness increases with island surface area and decreases with distance to the nearest mainland. The effect of area is more than 10 times lower than that usually reported for macroorganisms, but is greater than the effect of distance. The strongest relationships are for pathogens that are vector-borne, zoonotic (with humans as dead-end hosts) or protozoan.Main conclusion Our results support the basic predictions of the theory: disease diversity is a positive function of island area and a negative function of island isolation. However, differences in the effects of area, distance and pathogen ecology suggest that globalization, probably through human travel and the animal trade, has softened these relationships. Parasites that primarily target non-human species, whose distributions are more constrained by island life than are those restricted to human hosts, drive the island biogeography of human disease",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/article, Journal articles","disease ecology, human, Key-words: Infectious diseases, pathogen diversity, island biogeography, species-area  5  relationship, [SDV.MP]Life Sciences [q-bio]/Microbiology and Parasitology, [SDV.SPEE]Life Sciences [q-bio]/Santé publique et épidémiologie",,'Wiley'

Does good governance help?,,"Sjöstedt, Martin, Povitkina, Marina",2015,"Small island states have in recent decades been identified as particularly vulnerable to natural disasters and climate change. Violent winds, floods, and draughts have had severe consequences for millions of people and currently present an increasingly significant challenge for development and poverty alleviation in small islands. However, although islands tend to have similar geographical features, natural hazards produce widely different outcomes in different island states, indicating great variation in resilience. While some islands seem to cope and adapt fairly well, others suffer tremendously. That is the impact of natural hazards of the same physical magnitude ranges from going more or less unnoticed or causing only small disturbances to resulting in severe catastrophes. The overall objective of this paper is to explore the suggested sources of this variation further. More specifically, with the point of departure in theories about how institutions and social contracts affect collective action and adaptive capacities, this paper sets out to investigate how political institutions such as democracy, corruption, and government effectiveness impact the overall resilience of island states. While claims over the importance of institutions are well abound in the literature, there is a serious lack of systematic empirical accounts testing the validity of such claims.

These types of anecdotes are becoming more common, reinforcing evidence that small island states of the tropics and sub-tropics are some of the most vulnerable to extreme weather events such as hurricanes and cyclones. Although they are not a homogenous group, small island states share common characteristics that make them inherently vulnerable to the types of extreme weather events mentioned above. These characteristics include their small physical size and the fact that they are surrounded by large expanses of ocean, possess limited natural resources, and are relatively isolated, to name a few (IPCC, 2001).

Despite of their importance in syntactic theory, the heterogeneity of island constraints has posed many difficult challenges to linguistic theory, across all frameworks. The HPSG perspective of island phenomena is that they are unlikely to be due to a unitary syntactic constraint given the fact that virtually all such island constraints have known exceptions. Rather, it is more plausible that island constraints result from a combination of independently motivated syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and processing phenomena. The present chapter is somewhat different from others in this volume in that its focus is not on HPSG analyses of some phenomena, but rather on the nature of the phenomena itself. This is because there is evidence that most of the phenomena are not purely grammatical, and to that extent independent from HPSG or indeed any theory of grammar.

Although there is some evidence of less complex interaction networks on oceanic islands, only a few studies have compared island communities with each other or with mainland communities. Here, we analyse the species composition and structural properties of quantitative flower visitation networks in two communities of each of two different island systems: the Canary Islands (oceanic origin) and the Balearic Islands (continental origin). We compared different network parameters to inform us about their vulnerability in the face of different types of disturbance. The number of species was greater in the Balearic than in the Canarian networks but, contrary to expectations, the total number and diversity of interactions did not differ between them. Moreover, a greater number of opportunistic species and the presence of super-generalist species on the oceanic island led to significantly higher values of quantitative connectance and nestedness relative to those on the continental island. Given that these two parameters are associated with network stability, our findings support the hypothesis that oceanic island communities are less vulnerable to perturbations than are those of continental islands, although further studies with a network approach are needed to determine whether this is a general pattern. © 2014 The Linnean Societ",,text,Balearic Islands – Canary Islands – mutualistic interactions – nestedness –,,

Rippa, F. Carotenuto",2010,"Background Many small vertebrates on islands grow larger, mature later, lay smaller clutches/litters, and are less sexually dimorphic and aggressive than their mainland relatives. This set of observations is referred to as the 'Island Syndrome'. The syndrome is linked to high population density on islands. We predicted that when population density is low and/or fluctuating insular vertebrates may evolve correlated trait shifts running opposite to the Island Syndrome, which we collectively refer to as the 'reversed island syndrome' (RIS) hypothesis. On the proximate level, we hypothesized that RIS is caused by increased activity levels in melanocortin receptors. Melanocortins are postranslational products of the proopiomelanocortin gene, which controls pleiotropically pigmentation, aggressiveness, sexual activity, and food intake in vertebrates. Results We tested the RIS hypothesis performing a number of behavioral, genetic, and ontogenetic tests on a blue colored insular variant of the Italian Wall lizard Podarcis sicula, living on a small island off the Southern Italian coast. The population density of this blue-colored variant was generally low and highly fluctuating from one year to the next. In keeping with our predictions, insular lizards were more aggressive and sexually dimorphic than their mainland relatives. Insular males had wide, peramorphic heads. The growth rate of insular females was slower than growth rates of mainland individuals of both sexes, and of insular males. Consequently, size and shape dimorphism are higher on the Island. As predicted, melanocortin receptors were much more active in individuals of the insular population. Insular lizards have a higher food intake rate than mainland individuals, which is consistent with the increased activity of melanocortin receptors. This may be adaptive in an unpredictable environment such as Licosa Island. Insular lizards of both sexes spent less time basking than their mainland relatives. We suspect this is a by-product (spandrel) of the positive selection for increased activity of melanocortins receptors. Conclusions We contend that when population density is either low or fluctuating annually as a result of environmental unpredictability, it may be advantageous to individuals to behave more aggressively, to raise their rate of food intake, and allocate more energy into reproduction",,info:eu-repo/semantics/article,,,

The mechanisms of island drowning remain enigmatic, however, and the subaerial lifespan of volcanic islands varies widely. We examine swell bathymetry and island drowning at 14 hotspots and find a correspondence between island lifespan and residence time atop swell bathymetry, implying that islands drown as tectonic plate motion transports them past mantle sources of swell uplift. This correspondence argues strongly for dynamic uplift of the lithosphere at ocean hotspots.

However, the relative contributions of these factors on a global scale are unclear. Methods: We randomly selected 94 islands stratified by socioeconomic and geographic characteristics. With a Bayesian model, we assessed factors contributing to the probability of islands having a history of any dengue outbreaks and of having frequent outbreaks. Results: Minimum temperature was strongly associated with suitability for DENV transmission. Islands with a minimum monthly temperature of greater than 14.88C (95 % CI 12.4–16.68C) were predicted to be suitable for DENV transmission. Increased population size and precipitation were associated with increased outbreak frequency, but did not capture all of the variability. Predictions for 48 testing islands verified these findings. Conclusions: This analysis clarified two key components of DENV ecology: minimum temperature was the most important determinant of suitability; and endemicity was more likely in areas with high precipitation and large, but not necessarily dense, populations.

While the media, policy, and often scientific arenas essentially focus their attention on Small Island Developing States (SIDS), which are widely recognised as hotspots of global climate change, the situation of the numerous other vulnerable island territories has been relatively neglected. As a result, the focus on SIDS has paved the way for mainstream adaptation research and, in turn, for biases in the interpretation of climate change vulnerability and risks of small islands in general. Here, we argue that such an overly narrow scope severely limits our understanding of island-specific issues that influence island societies’ adaptability to on-going and future climate change. This article reviews the current perspective on challenges and opportunities for climate change adaptation on SIDS and compares it with other types of island territories, especially dependent islands of continental states and semi-autonomous sub-national island jurisdictions (SNIJ). This comparison reveals that despite critical socio-political differences between the respective island types, more general lessons can be learned as island territories at large face similar issues both regarding the drivers of vulnerability and exposure and the adaptation measures needed. We propose an analytical framework for looking ‘beyond SIDS’ that includes the recognition of critical issues (asymmetrical governance structures, archipelagic constellations, inter-island connections) that shape island societies’ vulnerability and leeway for adaptation to climate-related hazards",,"Article, isiRev",,,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC'
island susceptibility hypothesis,529667668,The Mediating Factors of land Sea Connectivity on Islands,,"Becker, Ceiba Belenos",2022,"Are island ecosystems connected to their nearshore marine environment? Islands are global biodiversity hotspots and the management of their natural resources is vital to the maintenance of global biodiversity and the survival of Earth's life support systems. However, both research and management have been slow to incorporate the importance of land-sea connections into their practice. Terrestrial and marine habitats are inextricably connected; incorporating the connections between the two to any research or management of these systems will improve efficacy by improving the resolution of our understanding of ecosystem drivers. If we are to incorporate land-sea connectivity into research and management, we first need to clarify our understanding of the patterns and variability of connectivity across geographic and biological contexts. The focus of this paper is to identify the factors mediating the ecological connection between land and sea on islands, which can be interpreted to determine the local importance of land-sea connectivity and identify candidate mechanisms defining the connectivity. With more detailed understanding of land-sea linkages, there is opportunity to apply this knowledge toward applied issues of island resource management and restoration. Using a practical case study of island restoration, we operationalize our proposed factors mediating the strength of land-sea connectivity to compare a set of islands targeted for restoration efforts, creating a prioritization based upon the island-specific estimated potential for improved land-sea connectivity and associated marine co-benefit of terrestrial management",,etd,"Macroecology, Conservation, Ecosystem Connectivity, Islands, Management, Resource Subsidy",,"eScholarship, University of California"

This study focuses on three islands (Pohnpei, Mokil, and Pingelap) in Pohnpei State (one of the four Federated States of Micronesia) and discusses the influence of globalization and global warming on those islands with reference to data developed from observation of the coral reefs and from a questionnaire on food, life-style, local awareness of globalization and global warming, and their effects on the human and natural environments. Based on the results of the survey, this study tries to verify two hypotheses. The first is a “centre-periphery” hypothesis that focuses on the distance between each island and Guam, the developed core (or centre) of the Micronesian region. The “centre-periphery” hypothesis argues that the closer the islands are to an urban center, the more globalized they become; islands that are farther away from the center remain more traditional. The second hypothesis we examined assumes that the effects of global warming on each island are similar in intensity. The results of our research show that meaningful “centre-periphery” differences exist among the three islands with regards to principal diet. A meaningful correlation can be seen between those islands closer to the center and the consumption of processed foodstuff; in short, the closer an island is to the centre, the more processed foodstuff its residents consume. In general, responses to the questionnaire reveal results that are compatible with the “centre-periphery” hypotheses. There are also results that run counter to the hypotheses we tested. For example, the degree of coral cover on the islands’ reefs differ; this suggests that the hypothesis about the similar intensity of global warming on all islands is not correct. We also discuss which factors have most affected the islands, and we offer an interpretation from an islandcentered viewpoint that includes topics such as food, communication, and the natural environment in the Micronesian islands",,"論文(Article), Journal Article, text, 雑誌掲載論文","centre-periphery hypothesis, globalization, global warming interdisciplinary, questionnaire, 519",,Kagoshima University

Island species are often associated with unique and even bizarre morphology, ecology and behaviour. For example, the kakapo Strigops habroptilus from New Zealand, is not only the largest parrot in the world, but the only living flightless or lekking Psittacidae. Island species are also well known for adaptive radiation such as the Hawaiian silversword alliance, Partula land snails o f the Pacific, Anolis o f the West Indies, honey creepers o f Hawaii and, o f course, Darwin’s finches of the Galápagos (Grant 1998; Schluter 2000). In addition, islands have provided a refugefor many ancient and phylogenetically unique lineages such as the tuatara, the sole representative o f the family Rhynchocephalia. Given the biological and scientific importance o f island biodiversity, it is o f great concern that most recent extinctions have taken place on oceanic islands, and a disproportionately large number o f island species are at present threatened (Groombridge 1992; Johnson and Stattersfield 1990; Whittaker 1998; Simberloff 2000). Despite the imperilled status o f island endemic species, relatively little is known about the process o f extinction on islands. More specifically, we have very little understanding of why certain island species or communities appear to be extremely vulnerable to extinction while others are exceptionally resilient. In this thesis, I focus on oceanic island endemic birds to provide greater insight into the extinction process on islands by examining the dynamic relationship between extrinsic extinction agents and traits or conditions o f island birds associated with persistence or vulnerability.Island endemic birds are among the best studied o f all island organisms, and their threatened status as well as recent extinctions have been relatively well documented. Birds, as a whole, have been well studied taxonomically in comparison to other classes (Bennett and Owens 2001), thus enabling large-scale phylogenetic comparative analyses. The large number o f oceanic island endemic bird species (n=987), allows the exploration o f global patterns and processes. The vulnerability to extinction o f island birds also makes them an important group on which to focus (King 1985; Mountfort 1988, Johnson and Stattersfield 1990). Thirty five percent o f  oceanic island endemic bird species are at risk o f extinction compared to 9% o f non-oceanic island birds. In addition, 88% o f recent bird extinctions have occurred on oceanic islands (data from13introductionBirdLife International 2000). Greater insight into the process o f extinction associated with this group may therefore have important and immediate implications for their conservation.Species that have become restricted to isolated island environments are often hypothesised to be uniquely susceptible to extinction (Williamson 1981; Atkinson 1989; Vermeij 1991 ; Paulay 1994). However, it has been suggested that the greater vulnerability o f island endemic birds is largely a result o f their very small distributions (Simberloff 1995; 2000). Thus, they may be primarily susceptible to processes associated with the small population paradigm (reviewed by Caughley 1994; Simberloff 1998) such as demographic stochasticity, environmental stochasticity, and reduced heterozygosity. Thus, if  oceanic island and mainland birds with similar distributions are compared, island endemic birds may not be more threatened to processes o f  extinction such as overkill, habitat destruction and fragmentation, impacts o f introduced species, and chains o f  extinction. These processes o f extinction have been coined by Diamond (1984b, 1989b) as the ‘evil quartet’.Manne et al. (1999) recently demonstrated that passerine island birds off the coast o f the Americas were no more vulnerable to extinction than their mainland relatives, when they controlled for species’ distributions. In fact, when only passerines with distributions between 1,000 and 100,000 km2 were considered, and montane species were excluded from the analysis, then island birds were less threatened than mainland species. Thus, it is unclear whether oceanic island birds are especially susceptible to extinction, or whether there are specific processes o f  extinction to which they are particularly prone or resilient.To understand why island birds might be more extinction prone or resilient to specific processes o f extinction, we must establish how island species consistently differ from their mainland relatives. There is great variation in the size o f  oceanic islands, their distance from the mainland, latitude, and habitat types. Thus, adaptations o f species may be expected to be specific to individual islands. However, species that colonise oceanic islands tend to find themselves in a species poor environment with fewer competitors or predators. Thus, island species may be subjected to certain common selection pressures resulting in particular ecological, evolutionary or behavioural14Introductionadaptations (see MacArthur et al. 1972; Diamond 1975; Williamson 1981; Stamps and Buechner 1985; Grant 1998; Blondel 1991, 2000).Examples o f documented trends associated with island endemic birds are flightlessness (Diamond 1981; Roff 1994; McNabl994a), a change in body size (Amadon 1953; Grant 1968; McNab 1994b), long bills and tarsi (Murphy 1938; Grant 1965a), reduced clutch size (Cody 1966; Lack 1970; Grant 1998), increased sexual size dimorphism (Selander 1966), decreased dichromatism (Mayr 1942, Amadon 1953; Sibley 1957; Grant 1965b; Herremans 1990), increased fidelity (Griffith et al. 1999; Griffith 2000; Mcller 2001),island tameness (Atkinson 1985; Grant 1998), and niche expansion as well as population inflation (MacArthur et al. 1972; Blondel 1991). However, few o f the island patterns have been rigorously tested and modem comparative methods are required to determine if  these observed island trends can truly be generalised (Grant 1998).The high extinction risk associated with island endemic birds is not a recent phenomenon. The first human colonists on oceanic islands have been implicated in extensive prehistoric island bird extinctions (Diamond 1982 ,1984a, 1989a; Olson and James 1982; Cassels 1984; Steadman and Pregill 1984; Dye and Steadman 1990; Milberg and Tyrberg 1993; Pimm et al. 1994; Benton and Spencer 1995; Wragg 1995; James 1995; Steadman 1995; Steadman et al. 1999). Subfossil remains o f extinct endemic birds continue to be detected on most islands that are surveyed (James 1995). On the tropical Pacific islands, Steadman (1991, 1995) has estimated that more than 2,000 species o f birds went extinct during the period o f prehistoric human colonisation (most o f which were flightless rails). If  this estimate is correct, then at least one fifth o f all birds extant during the early Holocene are now extinct (Milberg and Tyrberg 1993).Pimm et al. (1994) observed that birds inhabiting Pacific islands that have been colonised by humans for a long period o f time are at present less threatened, and have experienced fewer recent extinctions than those species on islands colonised more recently. It is, therefore, possible that prehistoric human-caused extinctions have resulted in some island bird communities appearing less susceptible to extinction simply because the vulnerable species have already been driven to extinction. This process is known as the “extinction filter effect” (Coope 1995; Balmford 1996). An extinction filter occurs when a region’s biota is faced with a novel extinction process. Initially, extinction rates may be high but, once the particularly vulnerable subset o f  species has15Introductionbeen removed, the remaining birds are less susceptible to the same or similar extinction processes. If past patterns o f human-caused extinction truly influence present patterns o f susceptibility, then understanding the extent and location o f past extinction filters may help to identify potential extinction-prone or resilient island communities.Thus, it may be important to have an understanding o f the various dominant processes o f extinction in the distant past and how they have changed over time. Unfortunately, it is difficult to infer the dominant causes o f extinction during prehistoric times.However, it is clear that exploitation by humans (Diamond 1984a; Milberg and Tyrberg 1993; Holdaway 1999), introduced species (Atkinson 1985; Diamond 1984ab; Keegan and Diamond 1987) and habitat destruction (Olson and James 1982; Flenley and King 1984; Holdaway 1989; Steadman 1995) were all contributing factors. The dominant processes o f extinction over the past 500 years are also poorly understood. However, a literature review for a subset o f recent extinctions suggests that introduced species and human exploitation were previously the dominant causes o f  extinction (Johnson and Stattersfield 1990). Identifying present processes o f threat is also challenging (Green 1994,1999), but assessments o f the conservation status o f all oceanic island birds suggest that habitat loss followed by introduced species are now the dominant processes o f  extinction (Stattersfield et al. 1998).If  extinction filters have occurred, it may be possible to identify species with specific life history, morphological or ecological traits that have been selectively removed from the island system by humans. If  species with specific traits are extremely extinction- prone, then they should be rare or absent where humans have been present for a long period o f time. Examples o f island endemic species with traits that are well represented in the subfossil record are flightless birds (Olson and James 1982; Steadman 1995; Olson and Jouventin 1996; Rando et al. 1999; Steadman et al. 1999), ground nesting birds (Duncan and Blackburn submitted) and large bodied birds (James 1995; Duncan and Blackburn submitted). Although many o f the particularly extinction prone species may have already been removed from the island system, there may be specific life history, morphological or ecological traits o f  some species or groups o f species, that make them more prone to extinction than others. Identifying extinction prone traits o f island endemic birds is important because it may help to identify species that are less well adapted to persistence within a restricted-range environment. It may also help to16Introductionidentify whether there are truly specific traits associated with island endemic birds that make them especially susceptible to human related threats.While many traits have been hypothesised to be associated with increased extinction risk on islands, such as flightlessness (Diamond 1984b; King 1985; Johnson and Stattersfield 1990, Roff 1994; McNab 1994a), larger body size (Duncan and Blackburn submitted) and heightened secondary sexual characteristics (McLain et al. 1995; Sorci et al. 1998; McLain 1999), the only conditions that have been consistently linked to greater extinction risk, are species with small distributions or populations (Diamond 1984b; Pimm et al. 1988). However, until now, a large-scale comparative analysis of traits that may be correlated with greater extinction risk o f island endemic birds has not been conducted.Analyses o f all birds or studies primarily focusing on mainland species have identified a few traits associated with increased extinction risk. Birds at greater risk o f extinction tend to have a smaller clutch size (Bennett and Owens 1997) and larger body size than those at lower risk (Bennett and Owens 1997; Gaston and Blackburn 1995; Pimm et al. 1988). However, a recent study by Owens and Bennett (2000) has demonstrated that large and small species may be susceptible to different threat processes. Specific groups o f birds that are associated with increased extinction risk are species found in deep- rooted lineages (Gaston and Blackburn 1997) or species poor taxa (Russell et al. 1998; Hughes 1999; Lockwood et al. 2000; Purvis et al. 2000).Given the present threat level and past extinction rate o f  oceanic island endemic birds, it is ironic that we might learn about traits or conditions associated with persistence or resilience from this group o f species. However, a few island endemic bird communities, such as the endemic birds o f Principe in the Gulf o f Guinea, appear to have escaped extinction and remained abundant despite extensive habitat destruction, the introduction o f exotic species, and human exploitation. Many species o f  island endemic bird are also remarkable for their ability to persist within extremely restricted distributions. The Lord Howe white-eye Zosterops tephropleururs, Razo lark Alauda razae, Noronha vireo Vireo gracilirostris and Nihoa finch Telespiza ultima are examples o f  birds that persist within distributions o f less than 20km2. A subspecies o f  the Principe seedeater Serinus rufobrutmeus fradei, has persisted on an islet less than 1 km2 for thousands o f years. Understanding the conditions, traits, or mechanisms associated with persistence17Introductionin a restricted-range environment, will help to identify communities o f species that may be more resilient to escalating human-related threats. It will also enable conservationists to manage for conditions necessary for the future persistence o f island endemic birds.The aim o f this thesis is to provide insight into the extinction process on oceanic islands, both in terms o f the changing processes o f extinction as well as the traits or conditions associated with persistence or vulnerability. A phylogeny has been constructed for all birds so that the comparative approach can be employed, with controls for the non­independence o f closely related species. I have addressed nine main questions in this thesis: Are there unique traits associated with island endemic birds? Have prehistoric human-caused extinctions influenced present patterns o f avian extinction risk? Has the process o f extinction changed from prehistoric times to the present? Have humans been responsible for the selective removal o f specific life history or ecological traits on islands? Are island or mainland bird species with similar distributions at greater risk of extinction? Are the extinction processes on islands and the mainland the same? Which life history, ecological, or morphological traits are associated with species that are more vulnerable to extinction? What is the status and distribution o f the endemic birds o f Principe and why has this community o f species been so resilient to extinction? What traits or conditions have enabled the Principe seedeater Serinus rufobrunnea fradei to persist on an islet o f  less than 1km2 for thousands o f years?This thesis is arranged as follows:Chapter 1 introduces the oceanic island data set, endemic bird data set, the phylogeny constructed for all birds, and the comparative methods employed for chapters 2, 3 ,4 , and 5. General patterns in the data are also described.Chapter 2 identifies life history or morphological traits o f  oceanic island endemic birds that differ consistently from their mainland relatives. The traits considered are clutch size, body size and sexual size dimorphism. The variation in these traits is also examined within islands. This is in relation to biogeographic features o f  a species, such as its distance from the mainland, total area o f geographic distribution, and latitude.18IntroductionChapter 3 explores patterns o f recent extinction and threat to oceanic island birds in order to test whether early human colonists to oceanic islands have acted as an extinction filter. If  humans have acted as an extinction filter, then fewer recent extinctions and threatened species should be found on islands having a long history o f human occupation. The relationship between the date o f first human colonisation and levels o f susceptibility to specific extinction processes such as human exploitation, habitat loss, and introduced species are also explored.Chapter 4 examines whether humans have caused the selective extinction o f specific avian life history, morphological or ecological traits on oceanic islands. This is tested by comparing birds on islands recently or never colonised by humans with birds inhabiting islands colonised in the distant past, to determine if  specific avian traits are less frequent or absent on islands with a longer exposure to humans. Clutch size, body size, flight ability, ground nesting, and forest specialism are the five traits examined.Chapter 5 first addresses whether island or mainland birds are more threatened with extinction. Threat types are then broken down into introduced species, exploitation, and habitat loss to see whether island or mainland birds are particularly susceptible to a specific threat process. Second, life history, ecological and morphological traits of island endemic birds are analysed to determine whether they are correlated to high levels o f extinction risk. The traits considered are body size, clutch size, sexual size dimorphism, dichromatism, flight ability, nest site, and habitat specialisation. The analyses are first conducted for all oceanic island birds, and then restricted to birds that inhabit islands or island groups that have been colonised by humans for less than 1000 years. The latter approach has been employed to reduce the extinction filter effect, caused by the selective removal o f species with vulnerable traits, on islands that have been colonised by humans for a long time. The relationship between the above traits and species threatened specifically by introduced species, is also examined.Chapter 6 is a case study o f the extremely resilient endemic birds o f Principe in the Gulf o f Guinea. Despite facing threats common to many islands, such as habitat destruction and introduced species, there have been no recorded extinctions. The endemic birds are not particularly threatened and they remain the most abundant species on the island. Research, carried out in the mountain and southern-lowland forest, along with historic and recent studies, are combined to estimate the total distribution and present19Introductionconservation status o f the poorly-known endemic birds. The conditions that have enabled the remarkable persistence o f these restricted-range endemics are discussed.Chapter 7 focuses on an endemic subspecies o f seedeater, Serinus rufobrunneus fradei, restricted to an islet located less than 3 km away from Principe that is less than 1 km2 in area. An estimate o f the population is given, using distance sampling and new observations are made o f its morphology, song, and ecology. Mechanisms and factors enabling this subspecies to persist within such a small distribution are addressed, and the implications o f this for the management and conservation o f isolated, restricted- range birds are discussed.20ReferencesAmadon, D. 1953.

Data is also collected on the habitats occupied by species, their threat status, and an estimate o f the date when they were first exposed to human colonists. Information on species life history, ecology and morphology has also been collected for many o f the island endemic birds. In addition, life history and morphological data has been collected for many mainland species so that island-mainland comparisons could be conducted. Thirty six percent o f oceanic island birds are threatened as opposed to 9% o f non-oceanic island birds. In addition, 88% of recorded recent bird extinctions have occurred on oceanic islands. The African and Pacific islands are the two areas with the highest proportion o f recent extinctions. They are also the regions with the highest proportion o f species that are at present threatened with extinction. A few orders and families have a disproportionate number o f  threatened birds while others have very few. Past extinctions appear to be caused primarily by introduced species and exploitation. However, species are now predominantly threatened by habitat loss and introduced species. Habitat loss is by far the greatest threat on the mainland, whereas habitat loss and introduced species are the dominant causes o f threat on islands.Chapter 1: Introduction to the database and general methods_____________________________26Introduction to the databaseIsland databaseUltimately, the definition o f an oceanic island is somewhat arbitrary in terms o f the size, limit and extent to which the island has been isolated from the mainland. In this database, oceanic islands are defined as islands that are smaller than 200,000 km2 and are separated from the mainland by a sea depth o f greater than 200 m. This definition is consistent with recent large-scale studies o f oceanic island birds (McCall 1997; Stattersfield et al. 1998). The largest island in the database is Celebes (180,680 km2) and the smallest is Cousine (0.25 km2). The database contains area, distance from the mainland, latitude, longitude and, for many, the date o f first human colonisation for over 500 oceanic islands or island groups. Information is also provided on whether the landmass is an island or archipelago, the ocean basin in which it is located, the nearest continent, other given names, and the political country affiliation.The total area o f each island or island group was obtained using the UNEP Regional Seas Directories and Bibliographies, provided by WCMC (Dahl 1991), UNEP/IUCN Vol 1-3 (1988a,b,c) or BirdLife International (2000). ArcView 3.1 and VMAP Level 0 data were used to determine the area o f  islands or island groups where no reference could be found. Distance is defined as the minimum distance o f an island or archipelago from the nearest continental land mass (Madagascar has been included as a continent due to its large size). These distance measurements are from McCall (1997) supplemented by measurements from Encarta World Atlas (1998b). Data on latitude and longitude are based on Dahl (1991) also supplemented with data from Encarta World Atlas (1998b). The date o f first colonisation refers to the time when human beings first arrived to an island. Estimates o f  the date o f  first colonisation are obtained from Webster (1972), Olson and James (1982), Steadman et al. (1984), Munro (1988), Jones et al. (1992), Milberg and Tyrberg (1993), Pimm et a l (1994), Wragg (1995), Steadman (1991,1995), Vianna (1997), Encyclopaedia Britannica (1998a) Microsoft Encarta Encyclopaedia (1998a) and Steadman et al. (1999).Bird databaseThe bird database includes all extant birds recognised by Sibley and Monroe (1990,1993). For recently extinct birds the taxonomy follows IUCN (2000) and BirdLife International (2000). Recent extinctions are defined as species that have become extinct within the past 500 years. Order, family, tribe, and common names are also given forChapter 1: Introduction to the database and general methods_____________________________27each species based on Sibley and Monroe (1990, 1993) for extant species, and BirdLife International (2000) for recently extinct species. The threat status o f a species and the dominant processes o f threat are based on BirdLife International (2000). Species are classified as lower risk, least concern (LRlc), lower risk, near threatened (LRnt), lower risk, conservation dependent (LRcd), vulnerable (VU), endangered (EN), critically endangered (CR), extinct in the wild (EW), extinct (EX), or data deficient (DD) (see IUCN 1994; BirdLife 2000). Threat types have been summarised into three major categories - those threatened by introduced species, by exploitation, or by habitat loss (BirdLife 2000). The threat from introduced species includes introduced predators, competitors, habitat modifiers, and potentially species that transmit disease.Exploitation refers to persecution by humans whether, for subsistence, sport hunting or the pet trade. Habitat loss is most often associated with deforestation, but may also result from events such as drainage or pollution. Data from Stattersfield et al. (1998) is used to classify birds into broad-range or restricted-range species. Restricted-range species are those with breeding distributions o f less than 50,000 km2, and broad-range species those greater than 50,000 km2 (see Stattersfield et al. 1998). Finally, I distinguish oceanic island endemic birds as those species with distributions restricted to oceanic islands. Species that inhabit islands separated from the mainland by a sea level o f less than 200 m, which do not breed on the mainland, are considered continental island species. A species’ with any part o f its breeding distribution on the mainland is also considered a mainland species.More detailed data have been collected for oceanic island endemic birds (excluding seabirds). For each such species, the island(s) on which they have been observed to breed are listed. The list o f islands occupied by each species is based on Howard and Moore (1984,1991), McCall (1997), Sibley and Monroe (1990,1993), Stattersfield et al. (1998) and, for the extinct species, on IUCN (2000) and BirdLife International (2000). These islands correspond with those listed in the island database. The number and type o f habitats occupied by each species is also given for all oceanic island endemic terrestrial birds, based on Collar et al. (1994), Stattersfield et al. (1998), Sibley and Monroe (1990,1993). Male body mass, female body mass, body length, clutch size, flight ability, nest site, and dichromatism are recorded for many o f the oceanic island bird species. Body mass, body length and clutch size, has also been collected for many mainland species. The definitions o f these traits and the extent o f  data collection are discussed in the relevant chapters.Chapter 1: Introduction to the database and general methods_____________________________28Chapter 1: Introduction to the database and general methodsIsland and bird databaseThe island database and bird database are merged so that each island endemic species may be assigned a total land distribution, minimum distance from the mainland, average latitude, and an estimate o f the date when humans first colonised an island within their distribution. For the analyses, the total area for a species is the sum o f the area o f the islands where a bird is found. Mapping the exact distribution o f species would have been preferable, but the precise distribution o f many island birds is unknown, and this measure provides a rough surrogate. Minimum distance is defined as the minimum distance o f a species range from the nearest continental landmass (including Madagascar). A species is assigned a latitude score from an average o f the latitudes of the islands where the bird is found. Finally, first human colonisation is an estimate of how long before the present (BP) humans arrived on an island or archipelago within a species’ range. For the analyses, total area and distance are transformed using natural logarithms and for first colonisation, I use the natural logarithm o f date (BP) +1.Comparative approachWhen using the comparative approach, species data can not generally be treated as independent data points for statistical analyses because species share associations among characteristics by decent from common ancestors rather than independent evolution (Felsenstein 1985; Harvey and Pagel 1991; Pagel 1992). Previous comparative studies o f  birds have shown that many o f the traits studied in this thesis show such phylogenetic pattern, necessitating phylogenetic analysis: (see Cotgreave and Harvey 1992; Roff 1994; Barraclough et al. 1995; Cotgreave 1995; Bennett and Owens 1997; MacCall 1997; Russell et al. 1998; Hughes 1999; Lockwood et al. 2000; Bennett and Owens 2001). To control for the effect o f phylogenetic non-independence, analyses have been performed on evolutionarily independent contrasts calculated using the Comparative Analyses by Independent Contrasts (CAIC) software package (Purvis and Rambaut 1995). The CAIC program calculates comparisons between the descendants o f each node in the phylogeny and produces ‘contrasts’. The contrast at each node assesses the correlation between the y and x variable (i.e. are big values o f  y associated with big values o f x, or with small values?). These comparisons are technically linear contrasts and can be pooled in a meta-analysis to determine i f  there is an overall relationship between the traits or characteristics o f interest.29A phylogenetic hypothesis is required for this approach. I used the avian molecular phylogeny o f Sibley and Ahlquist (1990) that is based on DNA-DNA hybridisation experiments, with classification below the level o f tribe following Sibley and Monroe (1990, 1993). Although contentious, Sibley and Ahlquist’s (1990) is the only comprehensive attempt, based on molecular data, to reconstruct a phylogeny for the entire class o f birds (Bennett and Owens 2001) and remains the most objective avian phylogeny to date (Mooers and Cotgreave, 1994; Cotgreave and Pagel 1997). Branches in the phylogeny are assumed to be o f equal length, as molecular estimates o f lengths have not been determined for most taxa below the tribe level.There are two algorithms in CAIC that may be used for calculating contrasts: CRUNCH and BRUNCH. Generally, CRUNCH is used when all the variables in the model are continuous, and BRUNCH is used when the predictor variable is categorical. CRUNCH uses species values to provide average estimates at higher nodes in the phylogeny. This enables CRUNCH to make contrasts both between very closely related species (e.g. sister taxa) and among higher nodes in the phylogeny. BRUNCH on the other hand, compares only the tips o f the tree using the values o f  each species only once. Thus, CRUNCH has greater statistical power, but makes more assumptions (Purvis and Rambaut 1995).For the analyses in this thesis where one o f the variables is categorical, the BRUNCH algorithm has been employed. Using this approach, the only evolutionary assumption made for the categorical variable is that, if  two sister taxa have the same character state, their ancestor is presumed to have shared that state too. The contrasts in the continuous variable are tested for normality and a one-sample t-test is used to determine significance. All contrasts were also analysed using Wilcoxon’s test which assumes neither normality nor homogeneity o f variance (Siegel and Castellan 1988).For comparative analyses with continuous variables, the CRUNCH algorithm was first explored. However, the ecological variables consistently did not conform to the evolutionary and statistical assumptions o f CAIC. The CAIC program assumes equal rates o f evolutionary change per unit branch length. I f  traits do not conform to Felsenstein’s (1985) model o f evolution then the scaling will be incorrect resulting in inappropriate standardised contrasts. In my analyses, this problem appears to be exacerbated when the average state o f  a node is estimated at higher levels in theChanter 1: Introduction to the database and general methods_____________________________30phylogeny. If the nodal estimates are not relatively accurate then the model o f evolution is violated and the contrasts lose evolutionary independence. Thus, the BRUNCH algorithm has been used for continuous variables as contrasts are only conducted at the tips o f the phylogeny and therefore each contrast maintains evolutionary independence. This more conservative approach resulted in fewer violations o f the assumptions. However, it does not completely resolve the issue of ecological variables being less likely to conform to assumptions about evolutionary process. Thus, the regressions through the origin, including ecological variables, should be interpreted with caution.All sets o f contrasts were assessed to determine if  they violated the evolutionary or statistical assumptions, as outlined by Purvis and Rambaut (1995). First I test whether the rate o f evolution is independent o f a trait’s current value (e.g. is the rate o f body size evolution comparable across the body size spectrum?). This is tested by regressing the absolute values o f the contrasts on the estimated nodal values, and testing whether the slope differs significantly from zero (Purvis and Rambaut 1995). I f  it does, data transformation and/or branch length transformations are in order (Garland et al. 1992). This requirement provides the rationale for logarithmic transformation o f many continuous variables: while absolute changes in body size are likely to be greater in large-bodied than in small-bodied lineages (e.g. ostrich vs hummingbird), proportional changes are more likely to be equal across the whole range. Second I test whether the standardised contrasts are appropriate for regression analysis. This has been done by plotting the absolute values o f  the contrasts against the square root o f the variance o f the unstandardised contrasts (Purvis and Rambaut 1995). In the few cases where the assumptions are not met the residuals o f the regression have been assessed to assure that they approximate a normal distribution. All contrasts for each analysis have also been plotted to ensure that the results are not driven by one or more influential observations.To determine whether a categorical trait is related to a continuous trait, independent of other continuous variables, the control variables must be tested individually (see Purvis and Rambaut 1995). This has been done by first analysing the continuous variable and the control variable in CAIC using the CRUNCH algorithm, with the control variable as the predictor. The dependent variable has then been regressed on the control variable through the origin. The slope o f this relationship is then fitted to the raw species dataChanter 1: Introduction to the database and general methods_____________________________31Chapter 1: Introduction to the database and general methods__________________________set and the residuals taken from the line (Purvis and Rambaut 1995). The residuals and the original categorical variable are then analysed using the BRUNCH algorithm.All extant oceanic island birds recognised by Sibley and Monroe (1990,1993) were used in this phylogeny with the exception o f 20 species within the families Brachypteraciidae, Mesitomithidae, Pluvianellidae, Philepittidae, Callaeatidae, Picathartidae, Hypocoliidae, as the affiliation o f these families within the phylogeny are uncertain (Sibley and Ahlquist 1990). Species driven extinct over the past 500 years or species that are extinct in the wild were only included in analyses if they could be placed in a genus recognised by Sibley and Monroe (1990,1993). This resulted in the exclusion o f 16 o f the 116 extinct or extinct in the wild oceanic island species recognised by BirdLife International (2000). For extinct species, where Sibley and Monroe (1990, 1993) and BirdLife (2000) include the same species with different nomenclature, the taxonomy o f Sibley and Monroe is followed.General patterns in the databaseThe data set includes 9623 extant birds from 145 families and 23 orders Sibley and Monroe (1990, 1993). O f the 9623 species, 987 are restricted to oceanic islands. O f these 987, 84 have been classified as seabirds. In addition to the 9623 extant species, there are an estimated 128 birds that have gone extinct in the past 500 years (BirdLife International 2000), 112 o f which were restricted to oceanic islands.Oceanic island birdsFor all bird species, orders that contain the highest proportion o f species restricted to oceanic islands are the Columbiformes (pigeons and doves), Struthioniformes (kiwis), Coraciiformes (kingfishers, todies, and rollers), Psittaciformes (parrots, cockatoos, lories, and macaws), and Cuculiformes (cockoos, and coucals). Orders that are noticeably rare or absent from oceanic islands, given their relatively high number o f species, are Galliformes (francolins, quails, pheasants, peafowl), Piciformes (woodpeckers, toucans, barbets), Trochiliformes (hummingbirds), and Galbuliformes (jacamars and puffbirds) (Figure 1.1).32Chapter 1: Introduction to the database and general methodsFigure 1.1.

Larger families with at least 15% o f their species restricted to oceanic islands are Zosteropidae (white-eyes), Procellariidae (petrels, shearwaters), Halcyonidae (kingfishers), Columbidae (pigeons, doves), and Meliphagidae (honey-eaters), Stumidae (starling), Corvidae (e.g. monarchs, cockoo- shrikes, crows, and fantails), Psittacidae (parrots, cockatoos, lories, macaws), and Rallidae (rails, crakes, coots) (Appendix 1.1). For a discussion o f families that tend to produce island endemic birds see McCall (1997). He found that overall species richness, the number o f  islands available in a region, and dispersal ability were the dominant factors in explaining the number o f  endemic oceanic island birds per family.33Threatened and extinct speciesOceanic island birds account for roughly one tenth o f all birds, o f which 35% are considered threatened with extinction. This is relatively high when compared to the 9% of non-oceanic island birds threatened with extinction (Appendix 1.1). In addition 88% of the 128 recent extinctions have occurred on oceanic islands.For three orders, the Tumiciformes (buttonquails), Struthioniformes (kiwis), and Anseriformes (ducks), every oceanic island representative is threatened with extinction. However, these orders are only represented by a few island species (Figure 1.2).Larger orders with high levels o f threat are the Gruiformes (rails, crakes, coots), Ciconiiformes (e.g. albatrosses, petrels, shearwaters, hawks, and falcons), and Psittaciformes (parrots, cockatoos, lories, macaws). These orders have also experienced high rates o f recent extinction. The Passeriformes (perching birds) have relatively lower levels o f threat than the other large orders (Figure 1.2).Figure 1.2. The proportion of species threatened for different orders, considering only species that are restricted to oceanic islands. The numbers following the columns represent the total number of species in the order that are found on oceanic islands.Chanter 1: Introduction to the database and general methods_____________________________Tumidformes Struthlon ¡formes An serl formes Gruiformes Craci formes Ciconiiformes Psittaciformes Bucerotiformes Columbiformes Passeriformes Strigiformes Coradiformes Apodiformes Pidformes Cuculiformes Trochlliformes Trogon (formesProportion34There are two families where all species are restricted to oceanic islands, and all species are threatened with extinction. These are Apterygidae (kiwis) and Rhynochetidae (kagu). In many other small families, the few oceanic island representatives are threatened, such as Fregatidae (frigatebirds), Spheniscidae (penguins), Eurostopodidae (nightjars), and Dendrocygnidae (whistling-duck) (Appendix 1.1). Larger families with a high percentage o f threatened oceanic island species are: Rallidae (rails, crakes, coots) (81%), Phalacrocoracidae (cormorants) (80%), Procellariidae (petrels, shearwaters, albatrosses, and storm-petrels) (65%), and Psittacidae (parrots, cockatoos, lories, macaws) (50%) (Appendix 1.1). Relatively large families with low levels o f threat are Trochilidae (hummingbirds) (7%), Nectariniidae (sunbirds and flowerpeckers) (11%), Vireonidae (vireos) (13%), Meliphagidae (honey-eaters) (15%) and Strigidae (starlings) (16%) (Appendix 1.1).Threatened regionsThe Pacific islands o ff the east coast o f Australia and Papua New Guinea, but excluding islands c l 000 km off the coast o f the Americas, account for 395 o f the 987 oceanic island species. Two hundred and forty nine species are found on islands off Southeast Asia including the islands o f Malaysia and Indonesia. Islands just off the coast (within cl 000 km) o f the Americas and Africa account for 202 and 110 endemic species respectively. Thirty one species, such as petrels or albatrosses, are too broadly distributed to classify into any one region.The endemic birds on islands o ff the coast o f Africa have experienced the greatest proportion o f recent bird extinctions (Table 1.1). Roughly one quarter o f the endemic birds have become extinct in the past 500 years (Table 1.1). This is followed by birds o f the Pacific islands where 13% o f the endemic species have become extinct. Recent extinctions have been considerably rarer for endemic birds on islands off the Americas and on islands o f Southeast Asia including Indonesia and Malaysia (Table 1.1). It is unlikely that the greater extinction rates on islands o ff the coast o f  Africa or in the Pacific are driven by a regional bias in the documentation o f  extinctions as there is no reason to believe that documentation in these regions would be any better than in the Americas or on islands off the coast o f Southeast Asia. The main bias in the extinction data is likely an under representation o f the proportion o f recent extinctions that have occurred in the four regions (see Pimm et al. 1994; Bibby 1995).Chanter 1: Introduction to the database and general methods_____________________________35Chanter 1: Introduction to the database and general methodsTable 1.1. Endemic oceanic island birds are divided into four regions, and the total number of species, number of threatened species, percentage of species threatened, number of extinctions over the past 500 years, and percentage of the region’s avifauna that have become extinct are listed.Island regions Number of speciesSpeciesthreatenedPercentthreatenedSpeciesExtinctPercentextinctPacific 395 168 43% 61 13%Southeast Asia 249 50 20% 4 2%Americas 202 70 35% 12 6%Africa 110 46 42% 35 24%Threat levels follow a similar pattern where the highest proportion o f island endemic threatened birds are found on islands off the coast o f Africa and on the islands o f the Pacific. The risk o f extinction is lower for the birds on the islands off the coast of Southeast Asia and on islands off the coast o f the Americas.Processes o f extinctionThe putative cause o f extinction was recorded for 68 species that went extinct in the past 500 years using Greenway (1967), Prestwich (1976), Collar and Stuart (1985), Fuller (1987), Mountfort (1988), Brouwer (1989), Day (1989), Johnson and Stattersfield (1990), Clements (1991), Gill and Martinson (1991), Jenkins (1992), Collar et al.(1994) BirdLife International (2000). Few extinctions have been well documented and so the identification o f dominant extinction processes in the literature is often heavily reliant on conjecture. The processes o f extinction associated with increased extinction risk are based on assessments o f each species by BirdLife International (2000). Extinction processes have been divided into three general categories: introduced species, exploitation, and habitat loss. If  a species became extinct or is presently threatened by only one extinction process, then the extinction process for that species is scored with a one. I f  there are two extinction processes, each process is assigned .5 and if  three, each process assigned .33. The most dominant cause o f recent extinctions appears to have been introduced species, followed by exploitation and finally habitat loss (Figure 1.3) ((see also Johnson and Stattersfield (1990)). However, the relative importance o f each process appears to have changed when causes o f past extinction are compared to causes o f present threat. Habitat loss and introduced species are now the dominant processes followed by exploitation (Figure 1.3).36Chanter 1 : Introduction to the database and general methodsFigure 1.3. The causes of recent extinction are compared to the processes in present threat. Recent extinctions include 68 birds that have gone extinct over the past 500 years. The analyses for threatened birds include 346 species.Dominant processes in recent extinctions Dominant processes in present threatOn the mainland the dominant processes of extinction appear to be very different from those on islands. Here only 4% of the birds are threatened by introduced species, 18% are threatened by exploitation, and 78% are threatened by habitat loss. Restricted-range species are defined as birds with a breeding distribution of less than 50,000 km2 (Stattersfield et al. 1998). Mainland restricted-range birds may be expected to be subjected to similar processes of extinction as island species as they both have very small distributions. However, this subset of mainland birds provides an even greater contrast when island and mainland threat processes are compared. Only 2% of restricted-range mainland birds are threatened by introduced species, 12% are threatened by exploitation, and 86% are threatened by habitat destruction.Distribution, distance from the mainland, latitude, and first human colonisation The island bird distributions range from species such as the Seychelles brush-warbler Bebrornis sechellensis and Seychelles fody Foudia sechellarum, restricted to islands with a total distribution of less than 3 km2, to species such as the plain pigeon (Columba inornata) or scaly-naped pigeon (Columba squamosa) found on many large islands throughout the Caribbean. The median size of the total island distribution for all oceanic island birds is 9104 km2, which is about the size of Puerto Rico (Table 1.2).37Chanter 1: Introduction to the database and general methodsTable 1.2. Each terrestrial oceanic island species in the data set has been assigned a total distribution, average latitude, minimum distance from the mainland, and date when humans first arrived within their range. The minimum value, 25th quartile, median, 75th quartile, and maximum value for each of theseN Minimum 25th quartile Median 75th quartile MaximumDistribution 901 2 1164.75 9104 38401.55 272346Latitude 901 .16 4.01 10.4 18.58 54.48Distance 901 14 300 680 1250 6064First colonisation 855 0 2000 7000 33000 100000The majority o f island endemic birds are found between the Tropic o f  Cancer and the Tropic o f Capricorn and roughly half o f them are found within 10 ° o f the equator. A notable exception is the relatively large number o f endemic birds that are, or were, found on New Zealand located at roughly 42°S. The Auckland Island rail (Lewinia meulleri) found at 50.74°S or the South Georgia pipit (Anthus antarcticms), located at 50°S are examples o f island endemic species found further from the equator.Endemic birds with the closest distributions to the mainland are those found on Cozumel, located 14 km from the coast o f the Yucatán Peninsula. However, the mediandistance is about 700 km. Réunion, off the coast o f east Africa, or Okinawa, off theeast-coast o f China, are examples o f  islands that are located at roughly this distance from the mainland. The most remote species inhabit islands in the central Pacific such as Tahiti in the Society Islands or Makatea in the Tuamotu Archipelago, both roughly 6000 km from the mainland. The Hood mockingbird Nesomimus macdonaldi, restricted to Hood Island in the Galápagos archipelago, is an example o f  a species whose islanddistribution has never been formally colonised by humans. A relatively large number o f islands with endemic birds have only been colonised over the past millennium such as Auckland, Lord Howe, New Zealand, Isabela (Galápagos) and Norfolk (in the Pacific),Aldabra, Cocos, Mauritius and Reunion (in the Indian ocean), and Fernando de Noronha, Inaccessible, Cape Verde, and Gough (in the Atlantic). However, most large island groups have been colonised by humans for over 1000 years, and a few such as the Andaman Islands, Nicobar, and Timor (Southeast Asia), may have been colonised for as long as 100,000 years.The phylogeny constructed from Sibley and Ahlquist (1990) and Sibley and Monroe (1990,1993) is available on the CD included within this thesis. The Island bird data set will be available at www.bio.ic.ac.uk/evolve once the chapters from this thesis have been published.38Chapter 1: Introduction to the database and general methodsReferencesBarraclough, T.

O R Y  AND M O R P H O L O G IC A L  T R E N D S ON ISLAN DS© Zoological Society of London45AbstractMany morphological and life history traits have been observed to change when species colonise and become endemic on oceanic islands. Despite extensive island/mainland comparisons, the generality of many o f these island trends remains unclear. Few consistent patterns have been demonstrated, and large-scale comparative analyses controlling for confounding factors, such as phylogenetic relatedness and latitude, are lacking. Identifying convergent life history and morphological trends on islands is essential for providing insight into the unique processes that can occur in an isolated restricted environment, and may help to highlight the traits o f island endemic birds that are associated with elevated extinction risk. I conduct comparative analyses o f island and mainland birds, controlling for phylogeny, to test for convergent trends in clutch size, body length and sexual body size dimorphism. I then examine how these traits vary among island endemics in relation to the distance o f a species’ distribution from the mainland, a species total distribution, and the average latitude o f its range. The analyses indicate that clutch size decreases in both passerines and non-passerines on islands, and that within islands, species with smaller total distributions tend to have smaller clutches. The commonly cited effect o f clutch size increasing with latitude was supported for passerines, but not non-passerines. Small birds tend to become larger on islands and there is a trend for large birds to become smaller although the latter is not statistically significant. For island avifauna, I also found little support for Bergmann’s rule that species’ body size increases with latitude. Finally, sexual body size dimorphism tends to increase on islands, irrespective o f which sex is larger on the mainland. These findings provide strong evidence that common processes are taking place within restricted and remote environments leading to the unique traits characteristic o f island birds.Chapter 2: Life history and morphological trends on islands_____________________________46IntroductionIsland endemic birds are often suggested to be particularly prone to extinction (King 1985; Johnson and Stattersfield 1990; Stattersfield et al. 1998). Much o f this elevated extinction risk may be associated with their restricted distribution (Manne et al. 1999; Simberloff 2000). However, island birds may have traits that render them at increased risk o f extinction to specific threats (Williamson 1981; Atkinson 1989; Vermeij 1991; Paulay 1994). To investigate the traits specific to island birds that are associated with elevated extinction risk, we must first establish consistent differences between island and mainland species. Many life history, morphological, behavioural, and ecological traits have been associated with insular or island endemic birds, examples o f which are listed in Table 2.1.Chapter 2: Life history and morphological trends on islands____________________________Table 2.1.

(1972), Blondel (1991)47Chapter 2: Life history and morphological trends on islands___________________________Some o f the observed trends on islands are conflicting and few have been rigorously tested on a large scale, controlling for the non-independence o f closely-related species (see Grant 1998; Blondel 2000).Island endemic birds are not a random subset o f mainland species (McCall 1997) since there is a filter on the type o f species capable o f colonising islands (Diamond 1974, 1981) as well as on the type o f species capable o f long-term persistence in a restricted- range environment (Hamilton et al. 1964; Salomonsen 1974). While this may explain much o f the variation observed between island and mainland communities, similar conditions associated with isolated oceanic islands, such as a reduction in competitors, a reduction in predators (Grant 1998) and a fixed restricted distribution, may result in conditions that promote convergent behavioural, ecological, and evolutionary traits (see MacArthur and Wilson 1967; Williamson 1981; Grant 1998; Blondel 2000).Here I examine the influence o f an isolated island environment on three life history or morphological traits: clutch size, body size and sexual size dimorphism. As these traits are correlated with many other aspects o f  a species life history, it may be possible to gain insight into many o f the patterns and processes occurring on islands. While I outline and discuss hypotheses associated with the processes driving island/mainland differences and the variation within islands, the main objective here is to establish patterns o f life history and morphological variation that appear robust in an insular environment.Clutch sizeClutch size decreases in many island populations or species (Cody 1966; Crowell and Rothstein 1981; Blondel 1991; Martin 1992; Grant and Grant 1998). However, there are exceptions (George 1987), and the trend has not been tested using a broad-scale analysis controlling for the confounding effects o f  latitude (Grant 1998; Blondel 2000) and the non-independence o f closely-related species. Very little work has been conducted on the relationship between island area, extent o f  isolation and clutch size. Wiggins et al. (1998) indicate that greater isolation may result in smaller clutch size, but larger egg size, as in island great tits Parus major. Environmental stability, multiple clutches, limited food supply, lack o f predation, increased survivorship and reduced genetic diversity are all factors that have been suggested to be associated with the reduction o f clutch size on islands (see Ashmole 1963, Cody 1966; Lack 1970; Snow48Chapter 2: Life history and morphological trends on islands___________________________1970; Ricklefs 1980; Frankham 1998; Wiggins et al. 1998). Blondel (1991, 2000) and Grant (1998) also suggest that high densities, in the absence o f predators and heterospecific competitors, may result in greater intraspecific competition thereby increasing selection for lower reproductive rates.Body sizeThere is a general trend for large mammals to become smaller, and small mammals to become larger on islands (Van Valen 1973; Heaney 1978; Lomolino 1985; Brown et al. 1993; Damuth 1993). The mechanisms suggested to be driving these patterns are complex and involve interactions among food resources, competition, predation, and selection for physiological efficiency (Heaney 1978), aspects o f a species mating system such as territoriality (Case 1978), and male-male competition (see Andersson 1994). A study based on 25 comparisons o f mainland and oceanic island birds suggests that birds may follow a similar pattern as mammals, where small species get larger and large species get smaller on oceanic islands (Clegg and Owens submitted). However, in general, few consistent body size distribution patterns have been identified when comparing island and mainland bird species (Grant 1968; Case 1978; Blondel 2000). Regional studies have reported both increases and decreases in body size with no clear trend (see Mayr and Vaurie 1948; Amadon 1953; Bourne 1955; Benson 1960; Watson 1964; Grant 1968). The only taxonomic groups o f birds that have been shown to consistently change in body size on islands are ducks (Anatidae) (Lack 1970; Williamson 1981; McNab 1994b) and perhaps crows (Corvus) (see McNab 1994b) where both tend to become smaller when they colonise islands.Within islands there is evidence that a small island environment with limited resources may lead to selection for smaller body size. Body size has been shown to decrease with island area for many species o f rail and duck (McNab 1994b). This relationship has also been documented in mammals. For example, the fruit-eating bats in the genj}$ Pteropus on oceanic islands (McNab 1994b) and populations o f  the tri-colored squirrel (Callosciurus prevosti) on continental islands (Heaney 1978).Sexual body size dimorphismThe mechanisms driving sexual body size dimorphism are varied and poorly understood (Andersson 1994). Niche partitioning o f resources between sexes may play a significant role (Shine 1989). Morphological divergence between sexes may result in49greater foraging efficiency in a biologically impoverished environment with reduced competition (Keast 1970). Sexual size dimorphism, primarily in bill morphology, has been observed in some island birds such as Centurus woodpeckers (Selander 1966) and the now extinct huia Heteralocha acutirostris (Gill 1991). Clegg and Owens (submitted) have demonstrated that non-passerines on islands have significantly greater sexual dimorphism in tarsus length. However, others have found no support for sexual size dimorphism as a general rule (Van Valen 1965; Keast 1970; 1996).Many believe that sexual body size dimorphism is primarily driven by sexual selection (see Jehl and Murray 1986; Mueller 1990). In birds, males are generally the larger sex, a fact which can be attributed to male-male competition for territory or mates (Darwin 1871; Andersson 1994). Isolated island environments are commonly suggested to have higher population densities and therefore greater intraspecific competition (Grant 1998; Blondel 2000). In addition, island birds, unlike many other terrestrial vertebrates, remain territorial on islands, and territoriality is even believed to increase in some species (Stamps and Buechner 1985). Such conditions may intensify sexual male-male competition for territories and mates, leading to increased sexual size dimorphism.Sexual body size dimorphism may also be influenced by relatively relaxed selection from female choice on islands. It is often suggested that island species have reduced levels o f sexual selection, based on lower levels o f extra pair paternity (Griffith et al. 1999; Griffith 2000; Moller 2001). This is supported by the observed trend for sexualcolour dimorphism or dichromatism to decrease on islands (Amadon 1953; Grant 1965b but see Clegg and Owens submitted).Here I compare these three traits between oceanic island and mainland species, controlling for phylogenetic relatedness. I test whether there is a trend for clutch size to decrease, sexual size dimorphism to increase, and body size to increase or decrease on oceanic islands. I then examine how these traits vary among species on islands in relation to a species distance from the mainland, average latitude, and total geographic distribution.Chapter 2: Life history and morphological trends on islands_____________________________50MethodsRefer to the island bird database (Chapter 1).Life history and ecological dataClutch size, body size, and sexual body size dimorphism data were from: Greenway (1967), Harris (1974), duPont (1975), Mayr (1976), Hannecart (1980), Watling (1982), Clunie (1984), Fuller (1987), Mountfort (1988), Day (1989), Gill and Martinson (1991), del Hoyo et al. (1992,1994,1996,1997), Bregulla (1992), Fry (1992), Jones (1995),Feare (1998), Rowlands (1998), Sinclair (1998), Clement (1999), Isler (1999), Madge (1999), and BirdLife International (2000). In addition, Dunning (1992) gives body mass and Bennett (1986) gives clutch sizes. Clutch size is defined as the mean number o f eggs in a nest and was logarithmically transformed for analyses. Data were collected for 2259 species, 1915 o f which are from the mainland, representing in all 880 genera. Body length is defined as the length in centimetres o f a bird from the tip o f  its bill to the end of its longest tail feather. Data was collected for 684 species, 160 o f which are mainland species. This includes 260 genera. Sexual body size dimorphism is measured as the difference between the larger and smaller sex, obtained by subtracting the natural logarithm o f the larger sex from the natural logarithm o f the smaller sex. Data were collected for 144 species, 84 o f which are mainland species representing 91 genera. Male sexual size dimorphism is obtained by only including the species where the male is larger or there is no difference. Female body size dimorphism is obtained by only including the species where the female is larger or there is no difference.Refer to the comparative approach (Chapter 1).Island/mainland comparisonWhere possible data were collected for the closest relatives within a genus or tribe for island and mainland species using Sibley and Monroe (1990,1993). If  data were only collected for one mainland representative o f  a genus or tribe, the mainland species with the closest geographical distribution to its island relatives was selected, providing data were available.The BRUNCH algorithm in CAIC is used to analyse the contrasts (Comparative approach, page 29). Non-parametric statistics are only presented where the results are quantitatively different from the one sample t-test. Contrasts were examined forChapter 2: Life history and morphological trends on islands_____________________________51Chapter 2: Life history and morphological trends on islands___________________________phylogenetic clustering and if clustering was evident between passerines and non­passerines, the analyses were also run separately for the two groups.Island and mainland clutch size is first compared, controlling for latitude. Grant (1998) suggests that latitude is important to control for, as a general trend has been observed for clutch size to increase with latitude (Lack 1947). Not all mainland species for which there is information on clutch size are included in this first analysis as data were only collected on the average latitudinal distribution for a subset o f  mainland species. However, finding no significant difference when controlling for latitude, the larger data set, including all mainland species for which clutch size data exists is used to test whether there is a decrease in clutch size, among island endemics, for both passerines and non-passerines.The average body length o f closely-related island and mainland species is first compared, after controlling for the effect o f latitude. Latitude has been controlled because body size may increase with latitude (reviewed by Gaston and Blackburn 2000). Finally, mainland genera were separated into two body size groups, less than and greater than 27 cm. When body length is regressed against body mass, 27 cm body length is about lOOg body mass -  a measure commonly used to distinguish small from large birds (e.g. Owens and Bennett 2000). The small and large mainland species are then compared to their closest island relatives to determine whether different processes are occurring for the different size classes.I conduct three analyses to examine the relationship between sexual size dimorphism o f island and mainland species. First I examine whether the difference in size between the larger and smaller sex o f a species increases or decreases on islands. Second, I test for a change in male sexual size dimorphism, and third I test for a change in female sexual size dimorphism. For all three analyses the confounding effect o f  body mass is controlled for as larger species may be expected to have greater variation in body mass (Andersson 1994).Variation among island speciesThe second set o f  analyses focuses on variation in clutch size, body length, and sexual size dimorphism within island species. Here, the variation o f these three traits is examined with respect to a species’ total geographic distribution, minimum distance52Chapter 2: Life history and morphological trends on islands___________________________from the mainland, and average latitude. Although the terms are all continuous variables, the BRUNCH option o f CAIC is used (see comparative approach, page 29). The life history traits are treated as the dependent variable and total distribution, distance from the mainland, and latitude the independent variables. Regression was run through the origin and a stepwise multiple regression approach used to test for significance. However, if  none o f the independent variables are correlated with the dependent term, then the test statistic and the p-value are reported independently for each o f the independent variables. As with the other analyses, if  variation was observed between the passerines and non-passerines contrasts, the passerines and non-passerines contrasts were also run separately.ResultsIsland/mainland comparisonThe clutch size o f  oceanic island birds tends to be smaller than their mainland relatives without controlling for latitude (df=52, t=4.56, p<0.001). This relationship is maintained after controlling for latitude (Table 2.2). As latitude has little effect on this relationship it is possible to compare the larger database (including species where latitude is not known) to determine if  the relationship is the same for passerines and non-passerines. The relationship is strong for both passerines and non-passerines (passerines, df=57, t=7.21, p<0.001; non-passerines, df=66, t=5.59, p<0.001).When birds o f all body lengths are compared to their mainland relatives there is no significant increase or decrease in body length (df=86, t= -0.28,0.77); this non­significant result is maintained when controlling for latitude (Table 2.2). However, assessment o f  the large and small body size classes separately reveals that different processes may be acting on these two groups. After controlling for the effect o f latitude, small species (<27cm) have island relatives that are significantly larger (Table 2.2) whereas large species (>=27cm) show a trend toward smaller body size on islands, although the latter relationship is not statistically significant (Table 2.2).Sexual size dimorphism appears to be greater on oceanic islands than the mainland. This result is verging on significance after controlling for the effect o f  body size and using a one-sample t-test (Table 2.2), and is significant when the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed ranks test is employed (n=50, Z=-l .95, p=0.051). I f  only species where the male body mass is larger than the female body mass are considered, the sample size is much53smaller, but the result is the same but stronger (Table 2.2). If the analysis is only conducted on the data where the female is larger, the trend still exists, but it is not significant using a one-sample t-test (Table 2.2). Using the non-parametric statistics, female body size tends to increase in relation to male body size on islands (n=14, Z=- 1.97, p =0.048).Chapter 2: Life history and morphological trends on islands___________________________Table 2.2.

The total distribution contrasts in relation to body size contrasts. Larger bodied species are not associated with smaller geographic distributions.DiscussionClutch sizeThere is a strong trend for clutch size to decrease on islands, and the analysis among island species demonstrates that clutch size continues to get smaller as a species’ distribution decreases.For oceanic island endemic passerines, clutch size appears to be larger at higher latitudes, and for species with closer distributions to the mainland. For non-passerines, clutch size variation is in general more Fixed at the family level than passerines (Bennett pcrs. comm.). The reduced variation in clutch size for non-passerines may explain why a similar relationship is not found for this group. The lack of a relationship of clutch size with latitude for non-passerine island birds is noteworthy as it constitutes a larger group of species that do not conform to the commonly cited pattern of clutch size increasing with latitude (see Lack 1947; Cody 1966; Ashmole 1963; Ricklefs 1980; Newton 1998).It must First be considered that small clutch size on islands may simply be a result of the differential success of species with smaller clutch sizes colonising and becoming57Chapter 2: Life history and morphological trends on islands___________________________endemic on islands. However, this in not supported by McCall (1997) who found no evidence that families with smaller clutch size were more likely to produce island endemic species.Another simple explanation would be that island birds have smaller clutches, but lay more clutches per year. This would be consistent with the theory that islands are more equitable, predictable or benign environments than the mainland (Cody 1966; Lack 1970; Abbott 1980; Blondel 1991). However, if  multiple clutching were the main reason for the smaller number o f eggs per nest, it is difficult to explain why birds with small total island distributions tend to have a smaller clutch size, as it is unlikely that species with smaller total island distribution have more clutches per year. While multiple clutching may play a role in the general trend for island birds to have a smaller clutch size, it would appear that other mechanisms are involved.However, it is difficult to distinguish the evolutionary and/or ecological mechanisms behind reduced clutch size, as many o f the proposed mechanisms are confounded with the size o f  a species total island distribution or the distance o f a species distribution from the mainland. For example, species impoverishment is associated with smaller islands and greater distance from the mainland (Diamond 1974), and therefore density compensation (MacArthur et al. 1972) may be more common on small or distant islands, resulting in increased intraspecific competition and reduced fecundity (see Grant 1998; Blondel 2000). Mammalian predators were also traditionally less common on small and distant islands. Thus, adult survivorship may have increased in such environments, and increased survivorship is negatively correlated with clutch size (Bennett and Owens 2001). Food resources may be less abundant with distance (Salomonsen 1974) and area (McNab 1994b). Reduced resources may result in reduced clutch size (Lack 1970). Even the effects o f  low genetic diversity would be expected to follow this same pattern.It is also possible that species with a smaller clutch size are associated with a smaller ahd more remote island distributions, simply because slowly reproducing species have been extirpated from much o f their range. However, this does not explain why island species in general have smaller clutches, unless their slowly reproducing mainland relatives have already been driven to extinction.58Chapter 2: Life history and morphological trends on islands___________________________One factor that deserves greater exploration is the effect o f reduced dispersal on clutch size. The mainland relatives o f species that colonise islands are believed to be abundant mobile generalists (Blondel 2000) associated with secondary growth and open habitat (Diamond 1970; Salomonsen 1974). Such species tend to have high reproductive rates and high dispersal. When these species colonise an island, the lack o f competitors and predators may result in higher population densities. However, if  strong selection for dispersal is maintained, then high population densities may not lead to a “slower” life history strategy. It is selection against dispersal and the subsequent shift from a high dispersal strategy to a sedentary strategy that may be the most important mechanism selecting for lower reproductive rates on islands.Thus, there are many hypotheses that may explain the observed trends and further exploration into the mechanisms involved will likely identify multiple and synergistic processes involved in the reduction o f clutch size. However, these will undoubtedly include greater intraspecific competition, reduced dispersal, increased survivorship, and reduced resource availability.Body sizeThe island/mainland comparison of body length suggests that birds may follow a similar pattern to mammals in that large species may have a tendency to get smaller, and small species a tendency to get larger. This relationship is similar to that found by Clegg and Owens (submitted).The exact mechanism driving the body size differences is difficult to distinguish. Small species may get larger due to lack of predators selectively targeting larger-bodied species, increased resource availability, selection for a ‘slower’ life history strategy, or sexual selection. Large species may get smaller due to energetic constraints or lack of predator selection for large body size. As suggested for mammals (Brown et al. 1993; Damuth 1993), there may be an optimal body size in birds that species evolve towards in the absence of predators and competitors. However, it is difficult to accept that taxa with such different ecologies would gravitate toward one central optimal mass or body length.The weaker trend in birds may be a result of the mechanical constraints that flight places on body size. First the constraints of flight may reduce the extent of body size59Chapter 2: Life history and morphological trends on islands___________________________variation possible within any particular group. This is supported by the much broader range o f body size variation found in flightless birds ranging from the Stephens Island wren Traversia lyalli to elephant birds (Aepyomithidae). Second, there may be even less variation in body size possible in species that require agility in flight. For example, species foraging for insects on the wing, such as swifts or swallows, may not be effective at a larger or smaller body size. If a lack o f predators is driving body size shifts on islands, then species that have their mainland populations more heavily regulated by predators may experience a greater size shift when they reach predator free islands. This may explain why mammals experience greater size shifts than birds, as mammals may be more predator limited on the mainland. Finally, trends in bird body size may be less because adaptive shifts tend to be expressed in other morphological characteristics (Grant 1968; Case 1978). For example, shifts in bill size or tarsus length (Murphy 1938; Grant 1965a).The results o f  analysing body length in relation to a species’ distance from the mainland, total distribution, and average latitude, failed to support many previous hypotheses. First, oceanic island birds do not appear to follow Bergmann’s rule, one o f the oldest macroecological observations, (see Gaston and Blackburn 2000), whereby body size increases with latitude. Thus, although it may be that specific clades with larger body size are found at higher latitude, when closest relatives are compared there is no statistical difference. The inapplicability o f Bergmann’s rule may simply therefore be a result o f  controlling for phylogeny in conjunction with the similar conditions found on islands at different latitude. Another study examining Bergmann’s rule using New World birds and controlling for phylogenetic relatedness only found weak support for the hypothesis (Blackburn and Gaston 1996). However, it is also possible that Bergmann’s rule does not apply on islands because o f the other body size shifts occurring in an island environment. For example, if  small species are becoming larger and large species are becoming smaller on islands then this may confound mainland -  based results.Second, it is interesting that distance from the mainland has no effect on the size o f species found on an island, indicating that large and small species within a genus are equally likely to colonise or persist on distant islands. This result is supported by McCall (1997) who found that body size was not associated with the tendency o f families to evolve island endemics.60Large-bodied birds (>=27 cm) are less likely to have smaller total island distributions.It is possible that energetic constraints on small islands have resulted in selection for smaller body size (McNab 1994b). However, it is more likely that the relationship is due to a filter on some large-bodied species incapable o f long-term persistence within a restricted distribution. This filter may be associated with larger bodied birds generally having a higher trophic position (Lawton 1994), greater energetic requirements (McNab 1994b), larger home range (Jenkins 1981), and lower abundance (Gregory and Blackburn 1995, but see Gaston and Blackburn 1995, 2000). These traits may both inhibit large species from colonising small islands and increase their risk o f extinction in such an environment.Sexual size dimorphismThe trend for sexual size dimorphism to increase on islands may be explained by resources being partitioned in a resource-limited environment with few or no competitors, increased male-male competition, or increased female choice for larger body size. These processes are interrelated and more than one mechanism may be acting at a time. If sexual body size dimorphism is primarily driven by niche partitioning, then one would expect both male and female divergence, whether bigger or smaller, to be o f similar importance. However, when species comparisons where females are larger than males are removed from the analyses, the statistical relationship is considerably strengthened. This indicates that increased male-male competition for territories or mates may be a significant mechanism in the increase in body size dimorphism. However, using non-parametric statistics, female body size dimorphism also significantly increases on islands. This trend for both male and female body size dimorphism to increase provides support for competitive release and niche partitioning between the sexes as the dominant processes. However, we cannot reject the possibility that sexual selection pressures may intensify in an insular environment.If  sexual selection plays an important role in the increase in sexual size dimorphism then it is strange that sexual selection is often cited as decreasing on islands due to lower levels o f extra-pair paternity (Griffith et al. 1999; Griffith 2000; M ailer 2001).Although extra-pair paternity has been shown to be associated with dichromatism (Mailer and Birkhead 1994), and dichromatism is associated with female choice (Mailer2001), the frequency o f extra-bond offspring has not been demonstrated to correlateChapter 2: Life history and morphological trends on islands______________________________61Chapter 2: Life history and morphological trends on islands___________________________with body size dimorphism (Owens and Hartley 1998). Thus the reported decrease in extra-pair paternities on islands may have little influence on body size dimorphism. Alternatively, the trend for lower reproductive rates on islands may be the driving mechanism leading to lower levels o f extra-pair paternity (Owens pers. comm.). The shift to a “slower” life history strategy on islands has been hypothesised to be driven by an increase in intraspecific competition on islands (Grant 1998), which may also lead to greater male-male competition for limited territories and resources. Therefore, extra­pair paternity may decline on islands, but the process o f sexual selection through male- male competition may actually increase.The consistent trends in clutch size, body size and sexual size dimorphism suggest that conditions on oceanic islands do select for certain convergent traits across bird taxa.The processes behind these trends are likely to be a combination o f a filter on the type o f species capable o f colonising and persisting on a distant restricted-range island, and selection for specific traits within an island habitat. If  the convergent traits have evolved in response to similar conditions on islands, such as reduced predation and competition, they may render a species more vulnerable to extinction, once humans introduce these selective pressures to islands. Thus, understanding the subtle convergent morphological and life history trends on islands may provide insight into traits that are associated with elevated extinction rates o f  island endemic birds.62ReferencesAbbott, I. 1980.

If a large number o f extinctions have occurred on islands due to human- related threats, then it should be possible to identify the effects o f  extinction filters. An extinction filter is a specific threat process that selectively removes a subset o f species. Thus, island birds that have experienced a human-related extinction filter in the distant past may appear less susceptible to present threats because all the vulnerable species have already become extinct. It is possible to test for the role o f humans as an extinction filter on oceanic islands by examining the relationship between the length o f time that humans have been on an island, or archipelago, and the present level o f avian endangerment. If the extinction filter effect has occurred, then islands colonised for a longer period o f time should have fewer threatened species. I use a global database o f all oceanic island birds to demonstrate that rates o f recent extinction are lower on islands that have been colonised by humans for a longer period o f time. This relationship is consistent for birds in the Pacific and non-Pacific. A similar trend exists for birds that are threatened with extinction, although the pattern is extremely weak. If threat types are analysed separately, there is a strong relationship for birds to be less threatened due to introduced species on islands that have been colonised for a long period o f time, but not for species threatened by habitat loss or exploitation. The analyses indicate that humans have acted as an extinction filter on oceanic islands throughout the world. Past patterns o f extinction have had a strong influence on which species have recently become extinct, but not which species are threatened with extinction. This indicates that the processes o f  extinction may be changing on islands.69IntroductionThere are 987 endemic birds restricted to oceanic islands, 35% o f which are threatened with extinction. This number is high compared to 9% o f non-oceanic island birds classified as threatened (Chapter 1). Oceanic islands have also suffered a disproportionate number o f recent bird extinctions. O f 128 extinctions recorded in historic times, 88% are oceanic island endemics (IUCN 2000; BirdLife International 2000). High levels o f extinction and threat to island endemic birds are not recent phenomena. The first human colonists to oceanic islands have been implicated in many avian extinctions (Olson and James 1982; Diamond 1982, 1984,1989; Cassels 1984; Olson 1989; Dye and Steadman 1990; Milberg and Tyrberg 1993; Pimm et al. 1994; Steadman 1990,1993, 1995,1998). On the tropical Pacific islands, excavations o f fossil and subfossil remains indicate that there may have been more than 2,000 birds that became extinct during the period o f prehistoric human colonisation (Steadman 1991, 1995). The dominant extinction process in prehistoric times remains unknown (Milberg and Tyrberg 1993); however, exploitation, introduced species, and habitat loss have all been documented (see Diamond 1984; Atkinson 1985; Olson 1989; Kirch et al. 1992; Paulay 1994; Steadman 1995; Holdaway and Jacomb 2000). Johnson and Stattersfield (1990) assess recent extinctions and suggest that introduced species were the dominant cause, followed by hunting and habitat loss. Current assessments o f  the threats to island birds find habitat loss to be the most dominant process, followed by the introduction of exotic species and over-exploitation (Stattersfield et al. 1998; Chapter 1).Understanding the nature o f extinction processes in the past is important because past processes may play an important role in determining the species that are now particularly vulnerable to extinction.I examine the role o f  first human colonists as an extinction filter on oceanic islands on a global scale to understand both the extent o f human-caused extinctions on islands and how the process o f extinction has changed from prehistoric times to the present. An extinction filter occurs when a region’s biota is faced with a novel threat that leads to the extinction o f a susceptible subset o f  species. The traits that make some species more susceptible than others will depend on the specific threat. An extinction filter can be detected when the same threat or a similar threat recurs. I f  there has been an extinction filter, fewer species will become threatened or extinct in regions or islands that haveChapter 3: Humans as an extinction filter on oceanic islands___________________________—70Chapter 3: Humans as an extinction filter on oceanic islands______________________________previously experienced the threat than in other comparable areas. This is simply because all the particularly susceptible species have already perished (Pimm et al. 1994; Coope 1995; Balmford 1996). Areas that have experienced extinction filters can have both lower threat rates and lower diversity than comparable areas.Pimm et al. (1994) observed that birds in the Pacific islands have lower levels o f threat and extinction on islands that have been colonised by humans for a greater period o f time. Here I extend this analysis to all oceanic island birds and control for potentially confounding variables such as the distance from the mainland, a species total distribution, and the effect o f latitude. In addition, I control for the non-independence o f closely related species and attempt to reduce the effects o f spatial autocorrelation. I also examine the relationship between species that are susceptible to specific threats (introduced species, exploitation, and habitat loss) and the period o f time that they have been exposed to humans. This enables the identification o f  threat processes that were significant in the distant past. If birds appear to be more resilient to a specific threat process on islands colonised more distantly in the past, it provides evidence that this extinction agent has played a significant role in prehistoric bird extinctions. These analyses also helps to identify threat processes where the probability o f  future persistence is not influenced by past resilience to human-related threats.M ethodsI explore the role o f humans as an extinction filter on oceanic islands using a global data set o f  all oceanic island land birds, details o f  extinct and threatened species and the history o f human colonisation in these areas. Two separate types o f analyses have been employed to reduce the potentially confounding influence o f spatial autocorrelation (Legendre 1993) and phylogenetic non-independence (Felsenstein 1985). The first approach uses general linear models to examine the relationship between the date o f first human colonisation o f an island, or group o f islands, and the proportion o f birds that are presently threatened or have recently become extinct. This reduces the effect o f spatial autocorrelation as each island or island group is an independent data point. The second approach compares closely related species to determine i f  the data at which time humans arrived within a species island distribution affects its probability o f  being threatened or having recently become extinct. This approach reduces the effect o f71Chapter 3: Humans as an extinction filter on oceanic islands______ ______________________phylogenetic non-independence as each comparison between a pair o f species is an independent data point.Island based approachFive different analyses are conducted. The first examines the relationship between the date o f first human colonisation o f an island or island group and the proportion o f endemic birds that recently became extinct. The second examines the relationship between the date o f first human colonisation o f an island or island group and the proportion o f endemics that are presently threatened. The other three models examine the relationship between the date o f  first colonisation and the proportion o f extant birds that are recorded as threatened by specific threat processes (introduced species, exploitation and habitat loss).The data on the island birds is based on BirdLife International’s endemic bird areas (EBA’s) o f  the world (Stattersfield, etal. 1998). This identifies 218 EBA’s, defined as areas that encompass the entire breeding area o f two or more endemic terrestrial bird species with breeding ranges o f  less than 50,000 km2. I consider marine EBA’s equal to or smaller than New Zealand giving a total o f 63 individual islands or archipelagos (Appendix 3.1). Taxonomy is based on Sibley and Monroe (1990,1993). For the recently extinct species the taxonomy follows IUCN (2000) and BirdLife International (2000).In the first analysis the dependent variable is the proportion o f bird species recorded as extinct in historic times on each o f the 63 islands or island groups (Ex), where a historic extinction is one that occurred subsequent to 500 BP. I f  a species extinction occurred in more than one EBA, it was listed as extinct in both EBAs. For the second analysis the dependent variable is the proportion o f endemic birds listed as threatened by BirdLife International (2000) (Tt). Species are not considered threatened if  they have been listed simply because they have a small range. Recent extinctions provide the most reliable indication o f islands or island groups that have particularly extinction-prone endemic birds. However, there is only weak and inferential evidence about the causes o f extinction. In contrast, for extant threatened species, the dominant causes o f  threat have been identified by BirdLife International (2000) including over-exploitation, the72Chapter 3: Humans as an extinction filter on oceanic islands_____________________________introduction o f exotic species or habitat loss (Appendix 3.1). I use these data to calculate the dependent variable for three o f the analyses. The dependent variable in the third analysis is the proportion o f endemic birds that are threatened by habitat loss or modification on each island or island group (Th), for the fourth, the proportion that are threatened by the introduction o f exotic species (TO, and for the fifth, the proportion threatened by over-exploitation (Te) such as hunting or the collection o f eggs. If a species is threatened by more than one threat type (e.g. introduced species and habitat loss), it is included in all relevant analyses. Species are often threatened by more than one o f these categories and there are synergistic relationships among threat types (Diamond 1984, 1989). However, here I am simply trying to determine the processes o f threat that are playing a role on specific islands and such a division o f threat types is therefore useful. For the five models the proportion o f historic extinctions or threatened species on each island or island group are calculated. The proportions have been weighted by sample size (McCullagh and Nelder 1989) to minimise errors caused by islands that are represented by a lower number o f endemic birds.In addition to the date o f first colonisation, six other independent variables are included in the analyses. These are the date o f  European discovery, the current human population density, the distance to the nearest mainland, the area o f an island, maximum elevation, and latitude. The date o f first colonisation refers to the time when human beings first arrived to an island. The date o f European discovery is the date o f the first record o f  an island or island group by Europeans BP. Estimates o f  the date o f first colonisation and European discovery are obtained from Webster (1972), Olson and James (1982), Steadman et al. (1984), Munro (1988), Jones et al. (1992), Milberg and Tyrberg (1993), Pimm et al. (1994), Wragg (1995), Steadman (1995), Vianna (1997), Encyclopaedia Britannica (1998) Microsoft Encarta Encyclopaedia (1998) and Steadman et al. (1999) (Appendix 3.1). The date o f  European discovery is distinguished from the date o f  first colonisation because the recent arrival o f Europeans, with exotic species and the technology to rapidly modify the landscape, may be the greatest factor responsible for shaping current patterns o f  threat and extinction.Human population density is defined as the number o f  people per square kilometre. Population figures were taken between 1970 and 1995 (Encyclopaedia Britannica 1998;73Chanter 3: Humans as an extinction filter on oceanic islands________________ ______________Microsoft Encarta Encyclopaedia 1989). The distance o f an island from the mainland is measured (in km) from the nearest point o f the island or island group to a continental landmass (including Madagascar) (based on McCall 1997; with additions using Encarta World Atlas 1998). Island elevation was measured as the highest known point (in km). (Stattersfield et al. 1998). Latitude is based on Dahl (1991) and Encarta World Atlas (1998).Island based approach analysesMultivariate models were fitted to data from the islands or island groups. The seven variables above were used in each o f five models to explain variation in the numbers o f historic extinctions and species threatened due to habitat loss, the introduction o f exotic species and human over-exploitation. All analyses were conducted using general linear models assuming a binomial error distribution and employing a logit link function (Crawley 1993).First the data were explored to identify potentially significant interaction terms. The five oceanic island analyses were then fitted using the same full model:Prop (dependent variable) = Region*first colonisation date + elevation + distance + area + latitude + European discovery + population density.The dependent variables are Ex, Tt, Tj, Th, and Te. The dot symbol (•) indicates the interaction terms plus the main effects were considered in the model. Region was included as a factor to determine if  there were significant differences between the processes acting in the Pacific and non-Pacific. The interaction term between region and the first colonisation date was included to investigate whether the effect o f first human colonists had similar influences on current patterns o f  threat and extinction in the Pacific and non-Pacific.The full model was fitted and terms were then dropped one by one starting with the least significant terms. If  a term was found to contribute significantly to the overall model it was fitted back into the model. Once only significant terms remained in the model, each o f the terms that had been removed from the model was re-entered to identify the minimum adequate model (Crawley 1993). Significant terms in the model were identified by the change in deviance, which is distributed approximately as x2 with74Chanter 3: Humans as an extinction filter on oceanic islands_________________ _____________degrees o f freedom equal to those o f the term that is added or removed. The x2 o f terms with a significance value o f P<0.05 are reported. Williams’ correction for overdispersion was used (Collett, 1991). This keeps the scale parameter the same, but the weight directive is adjusted and the model is then reassessed. The standard errors are then increased to account for the overdispersion. This approach is recommended when the sample sizes are unequal, as here (Crawley 1993). The x2 for each o f the terms in the final model were added and divided by the total deviance to determine the proportion o f the deviance explained by the full model.Species based approachThe questions addressed are similar to the previous analyses. However, this approach compares closely-related species to examine the relationship o f threat and extinction with the time they have been exposed to human influences. The classification o f threat and extinction, as well as the division o f species by threat type (introduced species, exploitation, and habitat loss) all follow the method o f the previous analyses.Refer to the island bird database (Chapter 1).Species based approach analysesI first address whether island birds that have been exposed to human-related threats for a greater period o f time are less likely to have recently become extinct. This analysis is then divided into birds found in the Pacific and those found on islands outside the Pacific to determine if  patterns are similar for the two regions. Second, island birds are compared to determine if  species are less likely to be threatened if  they have been exposed to humans for a greater period o f time. I also assess whether species that have been exposed to specific human-related threats (introduced species, exploitation, and habitat loss) are less likely to be threatened by these processes o f  extinction in the present.The contrasts were calculated using the BRUNCH algorithm in CAIC (Comparative approach page 29). All contrasts were tested for normality and a one-sample t-test was used to determine significance. The results were similar when the analyse were repeated using Wilcoxon’s test. The effect o f  the total area o f  a species’ distribution and minimum distance from the mainland and latitude were controlled for independently as these terms are cross-correlated with date o f  first human colonisation75Chapter 3: Humans as an extinction filter on oceanic islands_____________________________and may be associated with extinction risk. The results from the biogeographic controls are only given if  they alter the significance o f the relationship between human presence and levels o f threat or recent extinction. The above analyses were also run with date of first human colonisation divided into 10 categories (0, 250, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, 16000, 32000, 64000, >64,000 years ago). This was done because exact dates of colonisation are often poorly known and precision decreases with greater time.However, dividing the date o f first human colonisation into 10 categories did not significantly alter the results.ResultsIsland based approachThere were several significant variables reflecting both geography and human colonisation history in the final minimum adequate models (Table 3.1). Region was consistently non-significant across all the models indicating that there is no difference in the relationships o f threat and recent extinction with first colonisation date between birds on Pacific and non-Pacific islands.Extinction modelFewer recent extinctions (i.e. extinctions within the last 500 years) have occurred on islands that were colonised by humans in the distant past (Figure 3.1). In contrast, recent extinctions have been more common on islands that have high human population densities or islands that are located at greater distance from the mainland. Finally, species on islands with higher latitude have experienced a greater proportion o f recent extinctions (Table 3.1).Threat modelsSimilar to the extinction model, birds are less threatened on islands that have been colonised for a great period o f time (Table 3.1), a relationship solely driven by island76birds being less threatened by introduced species on islands that have been colonised for a greater period o f time (Figure 3.2). No relationship is found between the date o f first human colonisation and the proportion o f birds that are threatened by exploitation or habitat loss. Islands with high human population densities are more likely to have a higher proportion o f threatened birds, a relationship driven by species that are vulnerable to habitat loss and to a lesser extent to introduced species. Finally, birds on more distant islands tend to be more threatened. This is consistent for the three threat types, indicating that birds on distant islands are particularly susceptible to exploitation, habitat loss and especially introduced species.Chapter 3: Humans as an extinction filter on oceanic islands_____________________________Table 3.1.

Birds are less likely to have recently become extinct if  they have been exposed to human-related threats for a greater period o f time (Table 3.2). This relationship is true for both island birds in the Pacific and non-Pacific. Island birds are also less threatened if they have been exposed to humans for a greater period o f time. However, when I control for the total distribution o f a species, this falls just below significance (Table 3.2). Island birds are less likely to be threatened by introduced species if they have had long term exposure to humans. A similar weak relationship is found with habitat loss, but becomes non-significant if  I control for either a species total distribution or minimum distance from the mainland. Finally, there is no relationship between long term exposure to humans and a species vulnerability to exploitation.Chapter 3: Humans as an extinction filter on oceanic islands_____________________________Table 3.2.

They demonstrate that recent extinctions have been less common in regions where humans have been present for a long period o f time. In both analyses this relationship holds for birds in the Pacific and non-Pacific. Both approaches also demonstrate a similar, but much weaker trend for species to be less threatened in regions where humans have been present for a long period o f time. This trend is particularly strong for birds threatened by introduced species, but less so for species threatened by habitat loss or exploitation. This provides strong evidence that humans have acted as an extinction filter on oceanic islands throughout the world selectively removing species particularly susceptible to human related threats.79Chapter 3: Humans as an extinction filter on oceanic islands______________________________In the multivariate analyses the interaction term between region and date o f first colonisation was not significant in any o f the models supporting the contention that the extinction filter effect has been similar in the Pacific and non-Pacific. This is also supported by the species based approach that demonstrate a similar extinction-filter effect for recently extinct species in both the Pacific and non-Pacific. The uniform extinction filter effect is likely a result o f the similar biogeographic constraints and selection pressures on oceanic islands throughout the world. First, island birds tend to have restricted ranges that may make them more susceptible to most threats (Simberloff 2000). Secondly, similar conditions on islands such as lower species diversity and a reduction of competitors and predators (Grant 1998; Blondel 2000; Chapter 2) may lead to selection o f convergent life history, ecological, behavioural, and morphological traits that result in similar susceptibility to specific human-related threats -  e.g. flightlessness, ground nesting, or tameness.A strong extinction filter effect indicates that there is a relationship between persistence to past human-related threats and resilience to present extinction processes. Conversely, the lack o f an extinction filter effect implies that resilience to past human-related threats has little influence on a species’ probability o f surviving given present extinction processes. The latter scenario may occur if  the process o f extinction changes or intensifies over time.The absence o f the extinction filter effect can be observed by comparing the analysis on recently extinct birds, where the filter effect is strong, with the analysis o f threatened species where the filter effect is weak. Either we are not very good at identifying species that are prone to extinction, or the process o f extinction is changing and/or intensifying. Attempts to identify causes o f  recent extinction (Johnson and Stattersfield 1990; King 1985; Chapter 1) and present threat (Collar et al 1994; Stattersfield et al. 1998; BirdLife 2000; Chapter 1) support the latter. Introduced species and exploitation have been identified as the dominant cause o f recent extinctions, and habitat loss is now by far the greatest threat on islands.An examination o f the relationship between past exposure and present susceptibility to specific types o f threat helps to illuminate processes o f extinction that were significant in the distant past. In addition, it enables the identification o f threat processes where the probability o f future persistence is not influenced by past resilience to human-related80threats. There is a strong filtration effect evident for birds threatened by introduced species, but not those threatened by habitat loss or exploitation. Thus, introduced species were likely a dominant threat during the period o f prehistoric human colonisation. These data suggest that species susceptible to this specific threat have been selectively filtered from islands colonised by humans for a long time period. Thus, the remaining birds on these islands now appear to be more resilient, on average, to introduced species than those birds on other islands that have not had similar exposure.The lack o f an extinction filter effect for species threatened by exploitation is interesting because there is strong support for exploitation as a dominant human-related extinction process by early colonists to islands (Diamond 1982; Olson and James 1982; Olson 1989; Dye and Steadman 1990; Milberg and Tyrberg 1993; Steadman 1995; Holdaway and Jacomb 2000). An extinction filter effect may be difficult to detect if  the extinction process is very rapid and thus has run its course. For example, if  virtually all large flightless birds have been selectively removed from islands, then no variation will be detected when islands colonised recently are compared with islands colonised in the distant past. An extinction filter will also be difficult to detect if  the target species changes over time. Traditionally, exploitation would have been based on subsistence hunting. Species now threatened by exploitation are often harvested for the pet trade (e.g. Beissinger 2000). For many o f these species intense exploitation is a novel threat.Extensive habitat destruction by early human colonists has been documented on a few islands (e.g. Olson and James 1982; Diamond 1984; Flenley and King 1984; Kirch et al. 1991; Kirch et al. 1992; Paulay 1994). However, the extent to which habitat destruction or modification by early colonists has caused past extinctions remains a mystery. The lack o f a filtration effect with species threatened by habitat loss may indicate that there is little relationship between the extent or rate o f  habitat destruction and the date of human colonisation. Thus, it may have been the dominant process o f  extinction but has not been identified as an extinction filter. However, if  habitat loss was a dominant threat for past extinctions but does not function as an extinction filter, we would not expect such a strong relationship between the date o f first human colonisation and the proportion o f species that have recently gone extinct on islands. The fact that the filtration effect is much weaker for species that are at present threatened is strong support that the process o f extinction has changed or intensified. Estimates o f the cause o f historic extinctions and present threat support the conclusion that habitat destructionChapter 3: Humans as an extinction filter on oceanic islands_____________________________81Chapter 3: Humans as an extinction filter on oceanic islands_____________________________has only recently become the dominant extinction process on oceanic islands (Johnson and Stattersfield 1990; Stattersfield et al. 1998; Chapter 1) and continues to intensify (Simberloff 2000).The distance term was added to the multivariate analyses to control for the potentially confounding relationships among the date o f first human colonisation, the distance o f a species from the mainland and extinction risk. However, the strong effect o f distance in all the multivariate models is o f interest as it provides strong support that species at greater distance from the mainland are at greater risk o f extinction. This relationship is particularly strong for the models examining species that have recently become extinct or birds that are threatened due to introduced species. This increased susceptibility at greater distance from the mainland is likely a result o f isolated endemic birds evolving in a species-poor environment with few predators or competitors (Williamson 1981).This study supports the hypothesis that humans have acted as an extinction filter on oceanic islands throughout the world. Birds on islands that have experienced such extinction filters have been less prone to recent extinctions. However, now that the process o f extinction is changing on islands, species that have survived past extinction filters may be no more resilient to future threat processes. This is because different threat processes target different species. As habitat destruction continues to intensify on islands, past human-caused extinctions will continue to play a smaller role in shaping overall patterns o f threat and extinction. This analysis has demonstrated that extinction is a dynamic process where both the threats and intrinsic characteristics associated with increased extinction risk change over time. I f  we are to effectively identify extinction- prone species in the future, we must examine species in the context o f  historical versus present extinction processes.82ReferencesAtkinson, I. A.

Endemic island birds have experienced fewer extinctions on islands that have been colonised by humans for a long period o f time than on islands colonised recently. This indicates that the susceptible species had already been removed from the island avifauna before extinctions began to be recorded. I therefore hypothesise that those life history or ecological traits that predispose species to extinction may have been largely eliminated from such islands. Here I test five ecological and life history traits that are believed to result in species being at greater risk to human-related threats, and therefore might have been selectively removed from the island avifauna. I test this by comparing the ecological and life history traits o f birds on islands that have been inhabited for a long period o f time with birds on islands that have more recently or never been colonised by humans. I demonstrate that non-forest specialists, ground nesters, and flightless birds have likely been filtered from islands by human colonists. I do not find any relationship between body size or clutch size and time o f first human colonisation. This study indicates that humans have created a new selective regime and are presently in the process o f shaping avian ecological and life history traits on oceanic islands. It also suggests that traits associated with past extinctions may be very different from extinction-prone traits of presently threatened species. This implies that species may be at risk even in landscapes with a long history o f human disturbance.89IntroductionThe first human colonists to oceanic islands are believed to have caused extensive bird extinctions (Milberg and Tyrberg 1993; Steadman 1995). In the Pacific such colonists are estimated to have been responsible for the extinction o f roughly half the species on each island group (Pimm et al. 1994). Support for extensive prehistoric extinctions is provided by patterns in the geographical distribution o f recent extinctions and extant threatened birds, because extinctions over the past 500 years and present levels o f threat are lower on islands that have been colonised by humans for greater periods o f time (Pimm et al 1994; Chapter 3). This implies an extinction filter effect (Coope 1995; Balmford 1996), whereby species that were particularly prone to anthropogenic threats have gone extinct on islands, leaving only the less susceptible species. I f  this is true, it begs the obvious question o f which specific traits are related to extinction proneness, and so have been filtered from the island avifaunas.Species that evolve or adapt in an isolated, species-poor environment with few or no predators may have life history or ecological traits that make them especially vulnerable to the arrival o f humans (Williamson 1981). Alternatively, traits not specifically associated with islands may render species particularly susceptible to human disturbance in a restricted-range environment. Whatever the reason for their susceptibility, extinction-prone species may be quickly exterminated from an oceanic island’s avifauna once humans and their commensal species arrive (e.g. Holdaway & Jacomb 2000). If  this process has occurred it should be possible to identify specific life history or ecological traits associated with this extinction by comparing birds on islands that have been colonised in the distant past with species on islands that have only recently or have never been colonised by humans. I f  specific traits have been directly or indirectly targeted by humans these traits should be rare or absent on islands that have been colonised for a long period o f time, but still present in faunas on islands more recently or never colonised. Here, I examine five ecological or life history traits that may have been selectively removed by human colonisation causing extinctions. The traits I investigate are forest specialism, poor flight ability or flightlessness, ground nesting, large or small body size, and small clutch size.Forest endemics or forest specialists are presently the most threatened subset o f oceanic island land birds (Stattersfield et al. 1998). The extinction prone nature o f forest specialists is predicted by the theory o f the taxon cycle, where species colonise anChapter 4: Humans as a selective force: filtration of avian life history and ecological traits_____90Chapter 4: Humans as a selective force: filtration of avian life history and ecological traits_____archipelago as generalists, but evolve to become poor dispersers and increasingly specialised, and often experience a shift in habitat distribution from open grassland and shrubland to mature forest (Ricklefs and Cox 1972,1978). Species at later stages o f the taxon cycle are believed to be at greater risk o f extinction due to reduced competitive ability produced by counter-adaptation (Ricklefs and Cox 1972). If species at later stages o f  the taxon cycle tend to be both restricted to the forest habitat and associated with elevated extinction risk, then they may be among the first to go extinct on islands subsequent to human colonisation. Alternatively, the threat to forest specialists may only appear to be greater, because more susceptible open area and non-forest specialists may have already gone extinct. The habitat preferred by these latter species tends to be the first to be colonised when humans arrive. Either way, the distribution pattern of forest specialists and generalists across islands ought to be related to the date o f first human colonisation.The evolution o f flightlessness has occurred on many oceanic islands throughout the world. It is thought to be associated with lower rates o f predation, and the potential benefits o f energy conservation from reduction in muscle mass required for flight (McNab 1994). O f the 116 that have gone extinct, or extinct in the wild, on oceanic islands over the past 500 years, at least 23 are known to have been flightless or poorly flighted (see BirdLife International 2000). On the basis o f  subfossil remains, Steadman (1995) has estimated that prehistoric human colonisation preceded the extinction o f at least 2000 Pacific island birds, most o f which were flightless rails (see also Olson and Jouventin 1996; Rando et al. 1999; Steadman et al. 1999). Flightless species have been identified as particularly susceptible to exploitation by humans (Diamond 1984; Bibby 1995; Paulay 1994) and the introduction o f predators (Willis 1974; Newton 1998; but see Duncan & Blackburn submitted).Ground nesting may be more common on islands where historically there have been fewer mammalian predators. Ground or near-ground nesters have been identified as having elevated extinction risk (Duncan & Blackburn submitted) as they are particularly susceptible to introduced mammals such as Rattus norvegicus and Rattus exulans (Diamond 1984; Atkinson 1985; Moors et al. 1992). In addition, they are particularly vulnerable to human exploitation. Thus, rapid extinction o f ground nesters may occur shortly after humans and their commensals reach islands.91Large-scale comparative analyses have identified larger-bodied birds as being at greater risk o f extinction (Gaston and Blackburn 1995; Bennett and Owens 1997). Larger birds on islands would be obvious targets for hunters (Holdaway 1999, 2000). Large body size is also associated with lower population densities and lower rates o f reproduction (Gaston and Blackburn 2000), which may lead to an elevated extinction risk in a restricted-range environment (Pimm et al. 1988) especially when mortality increases due to processes such as exploitation (Beissinger 2000) and introduced species. In the New Zealand avifauna, Duncan and Blackburn (submitted) found that a disproportionate number of large bodied birds went extinct subsequent to human colonisation. Many of the well known extinctions on islands have been large-bodied species such as the moas (Dinomithidae) (Holdaway 2000), rails in the genus Porphyrio (Daugherty et al. 1993), elephant birds (Aepyomithidae) (Diamond 1984), the giant eagle (Harpagornis moorei) (Newton 1998), the great auk (Pinguinus impennis), and the dodo (Raphidae) (Fuller 1987). However, many o f the large-bodied birds that have gone extinct were also flightless.The extermination o f small-bodied birds by early human colonists has also been documented on many islands (Diamond 1984; Duncan and Blackburn submitted). On New Zealand, Duncan and Blackburn (submitted) identified egg predation by introduced mammalian predators as a likely cause o f the extinction o f  many small birds. In addition to introduced predators, Diamond (1984) identified habitat destruction as a cause o f small bird extinction. Many island birds have extremely restricted distributions and therefore relatively small overall populations. Under these conditions smaller species, which tend to have higher birth and death rates, may be more susceptible to stochastic demographic extinction (Pimm 1988; 1991), especially if  their already small populations are reduced by human-related threats.Bennett and Owens (1997) demonstrated that in general mainland birds with smaller clutch sizes are at greater risk o f extinction. Reduced clutch size o f  island birds has been reported in many species (Crowell and Rothstein 1981; Blondel 1991; Grant and Grant 1998), a trend that is robust when potentially confounding effects o f phylogenetic relatedness and latitude are controlled (Chapter 2). Thus, there may be strong selection for lower reproductive rates on islands which represent isolated species-poor environments with few or no predators. This life history strategy may then be particularly susceptible to human-related threats such as exploitation and introducedChapter 4: Humans as a selective force: filtration of avian life history and ecological traits_____92Chapter 4: Humans as a selective force: filtration of avian life history and ecological traits_____species that greatly increase mortality. It is possible that species with low reproductive rates may be among the first to be exterminated following the arrival o f humans.Here I test for the presence or absence o f these five traits in association with the date of first human colonisation. I control for the phylogenetic relatedness o f species, as well as for biogeographic features that may be associated with variation in life history or ecological traits.M ethodsRefer to the Island bird database (Chapter 1).Life history and ecological traitsData were collected on nest site (ground versus tree), body length, and clutch size for each species using the following sources: Greenway (1967) Harris (1974), duPont (1975), Mayr (1976), Hannecart (1980), Watling (1982), Clunie (1984), Bennett (1986), Diamond (1987), Fuller (1987), Mountfort (1988), Day (1989), Gill and Martinson (1991), del Hoyo et al. (1992,1994,1996,1997), Bregulla (1992), Fry (1992), Jones (1995), Feare (1998), Rowlands (1998), Sinclair (1998), Clement (1999), Isler (1999), Madge (1999), and BirdLife International (2000). In addition to these sources, Roff (1994) and Trewick (1997) were used to assess flight ability. Sibley and Monroe (1990,1993), Stattersfield et al. (1998), and Collar et al. (1994) were used to identify forest specialists. These are birds that are restricted to the forest habitat, versus non­forest specialists that are found in forest and/or open habitat.Poorly-flighted birds include all flightless birds and birds that are virtually flightless, but capable o f flying very short distances. Data on flight ability were collected for all oceanic island birds. Ground nesters are defined as birds that have open ground nests. This includes nesters in grass but does not include ground hole nesters. Tree nesters are birds that nest in tree holes or on tree limbs, but does not include shrubs. Data were collected for 309 ground nesters and tree nesters (165 genera). Body length is defined as the length o f the bird from the tip o f the beak to the end o f the longest tail feather, and was collected for 529 species (226 genera). Body length data were used instead o f body mass as the latter has not been measured for many island birds. The data were also divided into large and small-bodied birds. Species body mass between 50 and 150g were regressed against body length to identify the body length o f species that would be93on average larger or smaller than lOOg. The lOOg cut-off point is used because it has been identified as an important threshold in relation to different processes o f extinction (Owens and Bennett 2000). One hundred grams is roughly equal to a body length of 27cm. Species >=27cm were therefore considered large and species <27 cm were considered small. Clutch size is the mean number o f eggs per nest. Mean annual fecundity would have been a preferable measure, but these data are not available for most island birds. Clutch size is believed to be an appropriate surrogate to provide an indication o f fecundity (see Bennett and Owens 1997). Data were collected for 348 species (181 genera).Refer to comparative approach (Chapter 1)Analyses with categorical variablesFirst I address whether there are significantly fewer (1) forest specialists (2) ground nesters, and (3) poorly flighted or flightless birds on islands colonised more distantly in the past. Independent contrasts were calculated using the BRUNCH algorithm in CAIC (Comparative approach, page 29). All contrasts were tested for normality and a one- sample t-test was used to determine significance. The results were similar when the analyse were repeated using Wilcoxon’s test. The effect o f the total distribution o f a species and it’s minimum distance from the mainland were controlled for independently, as these terms are cross-correlated with date o f  first human colonisation and may be associated with the traits in question. For example, there is a relationship between the distance o f a species distribution from the mainland and the likelihood that a bird is flightless. Most flightless birds are also ground nesters, and so the ground nesting analysis was run both with and without the flightless species.Analyses with continuous variablesSecond I tested whether species with a (1) greater body length (2) body length >=27cm or body length <27 and (3) smaller clutch size are less common on islands colonised by humans more distantly in the past. The natural logarithm was used to transform the continuous variables, and independent contrasts were calculated using BRUNCH (Comparative approach, page 29). As the variables were continuous it was possible also to calculate contrasts to control for total distribution and distance from the mainland. I also controlled for latitude, as body size (reviewed by Gaston and Blackburn 2000) and clutch size (reviewed by Grant 1998) have both been shown to be correlated withChapter 4: Humans as a selective force: filtration of avian life history and ecological traits_____94Chapter 4: Humans as a selective force: filtration of avian life history and ecological traits latitude in birds. Linear regression through the origin was used to analyse the contrasts, with the life history trait as the dependent variable and date o f first human colonisation, total distribution, distance from the mainland, and latitude as independent variables. Stepwise regression was employed to identify the minimum adequate model.All the above analyses were also run with date o f first human colonisation divided into 10 categories (0, 250, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, 16000, 32000, 64000, >64,000 years ago). This was done because exact dates o f colonisation are often poorly known and certainty decreases over time. The division o f the dates into ten categories did not alter the results.ResultsAnalyses with categorical variablesAll three dichotomous variables, forest-specialism, poor flight ability/flightlessness, and ground nesting, have a significant correlation with time o f first human colonisation. There are more forest specialists on islands colonised more distantly in the past, or conversely, fewer non-forest specialists on islands colonised more distantly in the past (Table 4.1). Flightless birds and ground nesters are less common on islands colonised by humans more distantly in the past. This latter relationship holds if  flightless birds are removed from the analyses (Table 4.1). The number o f contrasts is similar for the two analyses because many o f the flightless birds have close relatives that are ground nesters, but not flightless. When total distribution and minimum distance are controlled for, all three relationships remain significant (Table 4.2).Table 4.1.

Total distribution, distance and latitude are also not significantly correlated with body length and when controlled for have little effect on the relationship between body length and time o f first colonisation (n=106, t=l .27, p=0.21). When the analysis is divided into large-bodied (>=27cm) birds and small­bodied (< 27cm) birds there is still no significant relationship (large bodied birds, n=50, t=-0.12, p=0.91, small bodied birds, n=66,t=-0.02, p=0.98). There is also no relationship between clutch size and date o f first human colonisation (n=76, t=0.22, p=0.83). In the clutch size model, total distribution and latitude are significant indicating that birds with larger island distributions and living at higher latitudes have larger clutch sizes (Table 4.3).Table 4.3.

This indicates that there may be some feature o f islands colonised more distantly in the past that results in species there being more likely to be a forest specialist. Islands colonised for a longer period o f time tend to be slightly larger and closer to the mainland. Forest specialists may be poor colonisers (MacArthur et al.96Chapter 4: Humans as a selective force: filtration of avian life history and ecological traits_____1972) and therefore less likely to reach islands that are more distant from the mainland. Alternatively, forest specialists that reach distant biologically-impoverished islands may expand their ecological niche in the absence or reduction o f competitors and predators (see Blondel 2000) and therefore would be less likely to be restricted to forest habitat. However, the relationship o f forest specialism to colonisation date remains very strong even when both total distribution and distance from the mainland are controlled for (Table 4.2). This indicates that the correlation may not be a result o f biogeographic patterns, but rather o f human colonisation itself. Non-forest specialists may have become either restricted to forest habitat, or else driven to extinction where humans have been present for a long period o f time because humans impact non-forest areas most intensely.The impact o f human colonisation on different oceanic island endemic avifaunas will differ in detail, but are similar in broad generalities. The first habitat types to be devastated are usually the most accessible and desirable for humans (Paulay 1994).They often include areas that can easily be modified using techniques such as burning (Diamond 1984). This opportunistic pattern o f habitat destruction can easily be observed on oceanic islands or island groups throughout the world such as Guadalupe, Mauritius, Rodrigues, Seychelles, Hawaii, Society islands and Norfolk, where the open areas and lowland, often dryer, forest have experienced the greatest levels o f destruction (see Crosby 1993; Pimm et al. 1994; Stattersfield et al. 1998). As the open area and lowland regions are modified it is the species that use this habitat type that may experience the greatest extinction risk. This will include many o f the open area and non-forest restricted endemics. The most susceptible non-forest specialists may become extinct or have their range restricted to the remaining native forest habitat, while a few may be able to persist in the transformed human landscape. The remaining forest acts as a refuge where species are less accessible and therefore less vulnerable to human exploitation, and there are often fewer introduced predators and competitors (Diamond and Veitch 1981; Chapter 6). As the process o f deforestation continues the forest refuges then become the most threatened habitat type as the now restricted non-forest specialists and forest specialists are limited to an increasingly small distribution.Islands that have been colonised for a greater period o f time may be at a later stage in this process, and many o f the non-forest specialists are now entirely restricted to forest habitat or else driven to extinction. The extent to which undocumented non-forest97Chapter 4: Humans as a selective force: filtration of avian life history and ecological traits_____specialists have been removed from islands inhabited for a greater period o f time awaits extensive studies o f subfossil remains. The ‘taxon cycle’ predicts that highly endemic species become restricted to ‘interior,’ forest (Ricklefs and Cox 1972, 1978). The analyses here indicate that this may simply be an artefact o f an extinction filter in open and accessible areas where human disturbance has been most intensive. Thus, highly endemic species may appear to be restricted to forest habitat simply because they have been extirpated or driven extinct by humans in open areas.This study indicates that humans and their commensal species may be responsible for the selective removal o f ground nesters and flightless or poorly flighted endemic birds on islands that have been occupied by humans for a long period o f time. Ground nesters appear to be missing from islands colonised in the distant past even when flightless birds are removed from the analyses. The wave o f ground nester extinction was likely primarily caused by nest predation from introduced mammalian predators. This process has been observed on islands where mammalian predators have only recently been introduced (e.g. the impact o f pigs on Auckland Island or rats (Rattus norvegicus) on South Georgia Island: Atkinson 1985), and inferred from studies o f longer term extinction patterns (e.g. Duncan and Blackburn submitted). Unfortunately, it is not possible to examine the effect o f flightlessness independently o f ground nesting as most flightless birds are also ground nesters. Therefore, it is possible that all flightless birds are missing from islands colonised by humans for a long period o f time simply because they were ground nesters. Although there is evidence that humans have heavily exploited flightless birds on oceanic islands (Steadman 1995; Holdaway 1999), an analysis o f extinction in the pre-human avifauna o f New Zealand found no significant effect o f  flightlessness on extinction probability once ground nesting and body size had been controlled for (Duncan and Blackburn submitted). The difficulty o f separating flightlessness from the characteristics with which it is typically correlated means that the susceptibility to extinction bestowed by flightlessness per se remains unclear. Nevertheless, whatever the reason, flightless birds have been extremely susceptible to extinction following human colonisation o f islands and current human pressures may continue to selectively remove this trait.The lack o f a relationship between the time o f human colonisation and body size indicates that prehistoric human-caused extinctions have occurred across the range of body sizes. This highlights the extremely complex relationship between body sizes and98avian extinction risk (Terborgh and Winter 1980; Tracy and George 1992; Gaston and Blackburn 1995; Duncan and Blackburn submitted). Owens and Bennett (2000) have demonstrated that different threat types appear to affect species o f different body size. Thus the broad spectrum of threats ranging from human exploitation to habitat destruction to introduced species and disease may be the reason why specific size classes have not been targeted. Even within threat types, there may be larger variation in the size o f species that are susceptible. For example, Holdaway (1999) suggests that the body size o f birds driven to extinction in New Zealand depended on the size and capabilities o f  the introduced predators and that a broad size range o f introduced predators resulted in extinction o f species right across the avian body size distribution. This suggestion is supported by a multivariate statistical analysis o f Holdaway’s data (Duncan and Blackburn submitted). It is possible that the extermination o f a specific size class has not been identified in this analysis because that size class has been so efficiently removed on islands colonised distantly in the past, as well as more recently.If this process has occurred, there would be no variation detected when birds on islands inhabited for a long period o f time were compared to birds on islands recently colonised. This may be the case with the very largest birds such as moa, elephant birds, large flightless megapodes, and Hawaiian giant waterfowl. At present, island birds with larger body size are more threatened (Chapter 5). If  species with large bodies were not more susceptible to extinction in the past, then this may indicate a change in the selective nature o f the extinction process on islands.Species with lower reproductive rates do not appear to have been selectively removed from islands inhabited by humans for a longer period o f time. This result is surprising as the arrival o f humans has unquestionably increased mortality rates o f many island birds, and those with lower reproductive rates would be expected to have experienced differentially higher extinction rates. Again this process o f extinction may have run its course or specific traits such as ground nesting or flightlessness may be much more important in terms o f susceptibility than whether a species has high or low reproductive rate -  and therefore dominate the results here.These analyses provide strong support that humans have selectively removed bird species with particular life history or ecological traits from oceanic islands. Humans have essentially imposed a new, strong selective regime on islands where specific traits are in the process o f being filtered from the endemic avifauna. While many o f theseChapter 4: Humans as a selective force: filtration of avian life history and ecological traits_____99traits are now associated with an elevated extinction risk, species with such traits may have been well adapted to an island environment prior to human arrival. These findings have important implications for studies trying to identify traits that may be associated with elevated extinction risk in extant species. Extinction-prone traits are directly related to the dominant threat process in a region and the most vulnerable traits are likely to change as threat processes change or intensify (Holdaway 1999; Duncan and Blackburn submitted). Life history or ecological traits that appear to be vulnerable in the present are also strongly shaped by the history o f past threats in a region. Therefore, a specific life history characteristic or ecological trait may not be identified as being associated with elevated extinction risk if  the trait has already been largely selectively filtered. Therefore, if we hope to gain a true understanding o f traits associated with elevated extinction risk we must examine the question in relation to specific threat types, and have a strong understanding o f the impact o f recent human-caused extinctions on a region’s biota.Chapter 4: Humans as a selective force: filtration of avian life history and ecological traits_____100ReferencesAtkinson, I.

However, it is unclear whether island or mainland species, with similar geographical range size, are at present more threatened with extinction. I control for phylogenetic relatedness and compare island and mainland restricted-range birds to determine whether island birds are more or less extinction-prone, and I identify the extinction processes to which island birds are uniquely susceptible. Results show no significant difference in levels o f threat between island and mainland restricted-range birds, but indicate that the processes o f extinction are slightly different. Island and mainland birds are both threatened by habitat loss and exploitation, but island birds are more susceptible to introduced species. Although island birds with similarly-sized distributions to their mainland relatives are not at present at greater risk o f extinction, there are a disproportionate number o f island birds that are threatened because they tend to have small ranges. It is therefore, important to try to understand the traits associated with island birds that are particularly extinction-prone. Here the comparative method is used to test whether seven traits are associated with greater extinction risk. I demonstrate that flightless birds and habitat specialists are at greater risk o f extinction than others. When I limit the analyses to birds that inhabit islands that have been colonised by humans for less than 1000 years, species with larger body size and ground nesting birds are also associated with greater extinction risk. As specific processes o f extinction are likely to affect species with different life history, ecological or morphological traits, analyses were also conducted to determine if  the seven life history, ecological, or morphological traits are associated with species that are particularly prone to introduced species, but no correlates o f extinction from this source o f threat were identified.Chapter 5: Avian extinction risk on oceanic islands_____________________________________106IntroductionExtensive prehistoric extinctions o f oceanic island birds have been well documented (Olson and James 1982; Olson 1989; Dye and Steadman 1990; Milberg and Tyrberg 1993; Pimm etal. 1994; Steadman 1990, 1993, 1995, 1998). Most recent avian extinctions have occurred on oceanic islands and a disproportionate number o f  island birds are presently threatened (see Johnson and Stattersfield 1990; BirdLife International 2000; Chapter 1). Despite this, the processes o f extinction on islands and the traits associated with increased extinction risk are poorly understood. In this Chapter I explore how island and mainland extinction processes differ. I examine how life history, ecological, or morphological traits are associated with elevated extinction risk in an island environment.Island species are often hypothesised to be particularly vulnerable to introduced predators and competitors (Williamson 1981; Atkinson 1989; Vermeij 1991; Paulay1994) . However, the apparent vulnerability o f island birds may largely be a result of their restricted range (Simberloff 1995,2000). Species with a small range size are more susceptible to stochastic demographic and environmental effects (King 1985; Pimm et al. 1988), as well as being more vulnerable to almost any extinction process (Simberloff1995) , than broad range species. Manne et al. (1999) demonstrate that, after controlling for range size, passerines on islands off the coast o f the Americas are no more threatened than their mainland relatives. Furthermore, when they limit their analysis to species with a range size o f 1,000 to 100,000 km2, they find that island birds are actually less threatened than their mainland lowland relatives. They postulate that these lower levels o f extinction risk on islands may be a result o f  competitive release (see Mac Arthur et al. 1972) resulting in higher population densities. They also consider the role o f  extinction filters (see Pimm et al. 1994; Balmford 1996; Chapter 3; Chapter 4). Here I first test whether island birds are less prone to extinction by comparing all closely-related restricted-range oceanic-island and mainland species. I then test whether island birds are less threatened by specific processes o f  extinction, specifically, habitat loss, exploitation, and introduced species.Irrespective o f whether island birds are less threatened than their mainland restricted- range relatives, when controlling for their range, it is clear that a disproportionate number o f island birds are threatened with extinction (Stattersfield et al. 1998; Chapter 1). For conservation purposes it is therefore important to understand why certainChapter 5: Avian extinction risk on oceanic islands_____________________________________107Chapter 5: Avian extinction risk on oceanic islandsspecies are particularly extinction-prone in an island environment. Insight into life history, ecological, or morphological attributes associated with elevated extinction risk may help to identify traits that are less well adapted to a restricted-range environment.It may also highlight extinction-prone characteristics o f island birds that make them susceptible to specific threat processes.Previous large-scale comparative analyses o f  birds analysing traits associated with increased extinction risk have focused primarily on mainland species (Gaston and Blackburn 1995; Bennett and Owens 1997; Owens and Bennett 2000). Here the global data set (Chapter 1) o f oceanic island birds is used to test seven traits that have been hypothesised to be associated with higher probabilities o f  extinction. These traits are flightlessness or poor flight ability, ground nesting, habitat specialisation, small clutch size, large body size, dichromatism, and sexual size dimorphism.Flightless bird extinctions have been extensive in historic (BirdLife International 2000) and prehistoric (Steadman 1995; Milberg and Tyrberg 1993) times, and can largely be attributed to over-exploitation and introduced species (see Johnson and Stattersfield 1990; Trewick 1997; Duncan and Blackburn submitted). Ground nesters have been identified as especially susceptible to introduced predators such as pigs, dogs or rats (Atkinson 1998; Moors et al. 1992). Both ground nesting and flightless birds have been shown to be less common on islands that were colonised by humans in the distant past, indicating that many species with these potentially extinction prone traits may have already become extinct (Chapter 4).Habitat specialists have been shown to have an elevated extinction risk in an analysis of 95 avian bird families (Owens and Bennett 2000). Forest specialists on islands have been identified as particularly threatened with extinction (Stattersfield et al. 1998). Island birds are often believed to become habitat generalists on islands (Diamond 1970; Keast 1996). However, this may be a result o f an observational bias toward small islands where species are arrested in the initial stages o f  evolutionary diversification (Grant 1998). It is possible that island birds undergo a taxon cycle (see Wilson 1961; Ricklefs and Cox 1972; 1978; Schluter 2000; Blondel 2000) whereby endemic species become less competitive, increasingly specialised and ultimately extinct (Ricklefs and Cox 1972).108Chapter 5: Avian extinction risk on oceanic islands____________________________________Small clutch size has been associated with elevated extinction risk for mainland species (Bennett and Owens 1997). This has been attributed to species with lower fecundity recovering more slowly from a reduction in population size (Pimm et al. 1988). Thus, species on islands with lower rates o f fecundity may be particularly extinction prone when human-related threats result in a significant increase in mortality.Large body size has been demonstrated to be associated with elevated extinction risk for birds (Gaston and Blackburn 1995; Bennett and Owens 1997). More specifically, large birds have been shown to be at great extinction risk due to persecution and introduced predators (Owens and Bennett 2000). Large birds tend to have slower reproductive rates and lower levels o f abundance that may result in greater extinction risk. These traits may be particularly prone in a restricted-range environment. However, the general relationship between extinction risk and large body size remains under debate (reviewed by Gaston and Blackburn 2000).There are a number o f reasons why more intense sexual selection may result in increased risk o f extinction. (1) The exaggeration o f secondary sexual characteristics, reflected in both dichromatism and dimorphism between the sexes, may result in costs to individuals o f the chosen sex, thus causing a reduction o f the mean fitness o f individuals o f a population (McLain et al. 1995; Moller 2000). (2) Intensely sexually-selected species may be more inbred and therefore lower heterozygosity because o f an extreme skew in male mating systems (Moller 2001). (3) Small populations with intensesexual selection may be more susceptible to demographic stochasticity as a result o f strict female preference (Moller 2000). (4) Species that experience strong sexualselection may be more likely to speciate (Barraclough et al. 1995; Moller and Cuervo1998; Owens et al. 1999) and therefore become restricted to small, potentially vulnerable distributions (Meller 2000). There is support for the hypothesis that sexualselection may be associated with increased extinction risk in small populations in studies that have demonstrated that dichromatic species introduced to oceanic islands are less likely to persist than monochromatic species (McLain et al. 1995; Sorci et al. 1998; McLain et al. 1999). There is at present no evidence that size dimorphism is associated with greater risk o f  extinction in birds. However, a study o f beetles on islands demonstrated that more dimorphic species are less likely to occur within a109Chapter 5: Avian extinction risk on oceanic islandssmaller distribution, and are less likely to persist within smaller distributions from one year to the next (McLain and Vives 1998).One o f the problems with testing correlates o f extinction in an environment where humans may have caused extensive selective extinctions is that many o f the species with particularly vulnerable traits may have already become extinct (Chapter 4). Thus, it may be difficult to identify species with traits that are associated with an increased risk o f extinction. To identify whether extinction-filters influence the traits that are associated with elevated extinction risk, an analysis was conducted for the subset o f birds that are restricted to islands that have been colonised by humans for less than 1000 years. It is assumed that species with vulnerable traits are less likely to have already been filtered from these islands.Finally, Owens and Bennett (2000) demonstrate that different extinction processes may target species with different traits. As island birds are often cited as being especially vulnerable to introduced species (Williamson 1981; Vermeij 1991; Paulay 1994), the data have also been analysed to determine if  specific traits are associated with birds susceptible to introductions. This may help to highlight especially vulnerable traits o f island endemic birds.M ethodsDifferent data sets have been used for the island versus mainland comparisons and the analysis o f life history, ecological, or morphological traits that are correlated with greater extinction risk. There are however many similarities. Species are defined following the taxonomy of Sibley and Monroe (1990,1993) for extant birds, and BirdLife International (2000) for recent extinctions. In addition, both data sets define an oceanic island endemic bird as a species with a breeding distribution restricted to islands that were not attached to a mainland during the last period o f glaciation. Only islands smaller than or equal to New Zealand are considered.The IUCN categories o f threat are also used in both analyses to assess extinction risk (IUCN 1994; BirdLife International 2000). Species have been scored on a scale from species that are not threatened to species that have recently become extinct. The categories o f  threat consist of: data deficient (DD); lower risk, least concern (LRlc); lower risk, near threatened (LRnt); lower risk, conservation dependent (LRcd);110vulnerable (VU); endangered (EN); critically endangered (CR); extinct in the wild (EW); or extinct (EX). Only extinctions that have occurred over the past 500 years are considered and species that are extinct in the wild are classified as extinct. The few species that are listed as conservation dependent by BirdLife International I categorised as near threatened, and species classified as data deficient are not included in the analyses. For some analyses, recent extinctions are excluded, and near threatened and lower risk species are merged into one category. The explanation for this is given in each o f the specific analyses. BirdLife International (2000) identifies the major processes o f extinction associated with every species classified as threatened.Therefore, it is possible to create an extinction risk index for specific threat types. Here, species threatened by introductions, exploitation, and habitat loss have been divided into three different groups. Each species threatened by a specific extinction process is listed with its conservation status ranging from zero to three (lower risk=0, vulnerable=l, endangered=2, and critically endangered=3). Recent extinctions cannot be included, as we are uncertain o f  their causes o f extinction.Island mainland databaseThe database consists o f 2130 mainland and oceanic island species (including representatives o f 797 genera) that are considered to be restricted-range birds by BirdLife International (Stattersfield et. al 1998). Restricted-range species are defined as birds with a breeding range o f less than 50,000 km2. Mainland birds are defined as species with any part o f their breeding distribution on a mainland. Species restricted to islands that were attached to the mainland during the last period o f glaciation (continental island species) are not included in the data set. Sea birds have also been excluded, as they are generally not limited to the resources o f  their restricted breeding distribution.Refer to the island bird database (Chapter 1).Life history, ecological, and morphological traitsData were collected for nest site (ground versus tree), dichromatism, flight ability, clutch size, body length, and sexual size dimorphism using the following sources: Greenway (1967) Harris (1974), duPont (1975), Mayr (1976), Hannecart (1980), Watling (1982), Clunie (1984), Fuller (1987), Mountfort (1988), Day (1989), Gill and Martinson (1991), del Hoyo etal. (1992,1994,1996,1997), Bregulla (1992), Fry (1992),Chapter 5: Avian extinction risk on oceanic islands____________________________________111Chapter 5: Avian extinction risk on oceanic islands ______________________________Jones (1995), Feare (1998), Rowlands (1998), Sinclair (1998), Clement (1999), Isler (1999), Madge (1999), and BirdLife International (2000). In addition to these sources, Roff (1994) and Trewick (1997) were used to specifically assess flight ability, Bennett (1986) for mainland birds clutch size, and Dunning (1992) for body weights. Sibley and Monroe (1990,1993), Stattersfield et al. (1998), and Collar et al. (1994) were used to identify the type and number o f habitats in which oceanic island birds are found.Ground nesters are defined as birds that have open-ground nests. This includes nesters in grass, but does not include ground-hole nesters. Tree nesters are birds that nest in tree holes or on tree limbs, but does not include species that nest in shrubs. Data were collected for 309 ground nesters and tree nesters (165 genera). Dichromatic birds are defined as birds where the male and female differ in colour or markings. Data were collected on 513 species including 214 genera. Poorly-flighted birds include all flightless birds and species that are capable o f flying only very short distances. Data on flight ability were collected for all oceanic island birds. Clutch size refers to the mean number o f eggs per nest. Data were collected for 348 species (181 genera). Body length is defined as the length o f the bird from the tip o f the beak to the end o f the longest tail feather, and was collected for 529 species (226 genera). The data were also divided into sets for large (>=27 cm) and small-bodied (27 cm) birds (see Chapter 4). Sexual body size dimorphism is measured as the difference between the larger and smaller sex, obtained by subtracting the natural logarithm o f the larger sex from the natural logarithm o f the smaller sex. Here 85 species have been collected with weights for both males and females (64 genera). Island birds are classified by the number o f habitat types in which they are located. The habitat classification system is based on Collar et al. (1994) and includes 12 habitat codes such as, scrub, savannah, grassland, wetlands or forest. Data were collected for all oceanic island birds.Refer to the comparative approach (Chapter 1).Island/mainland analysesThe first set o f analyses address whether oceanic-island restricted-range birds are less threatened than mainland species with similar restricted-range distributions. Restricted- rage birds are used as a surrogate to control for a species distribution as exact distributions were not collected for mainland species. Oceanic-island restricted-range birds and mainland restricted-range birds are then compared to determine if  they are112susceptible to specific processes o f extinction. These are: introduced species, exploitation, and habitat loss. Extinction risk is scored on a four point scale (lower risk=0, vulnerable =1, endangered=2, critically endangered=3). Species classified as lower risk/near threatened and lower risk/least concern have been merged. This has been done because causes o f threat have not been attributed to near-threatened species.In addition the analyses have also been conducted excluding oceanic island birds with•yrange sizes below 10,000 km (roughly the size o f the Hawaiian Islands). This is because few mainland restricted-range-species have distributions smaller than 10,000 km2 (see Stattersfield et al. 1998). Removing oceanic island birds with smaller distributions helps to determine whether the range size bias between island and mainland restricted-range birds significantly influences the results from the restricted- range island-mainland comparison.The island/mainland bird comparisons have also been run separately for passerines and non-passerines to determine if the differences between oceanic island and mainland birds are consistent for these two groups. It is particularly important to analyse the passerines separately as this is the group that Manne et al. (1999) have demonstrated to be less threatened on islands than on the lowland mainland, when they control for the effect o f  range size. Independent contrasts were calculated using the BRUNCH algorithm in CAIC (Comparative approach, page 29). All contrasts are analysed using Wilcoxon’s test which assumes neither normality nor homogeneity o f  variance (Siegel and Castellan 1988).Correlates o f extinction analysesThe second group o f analyses examines characteristics o f birds restricted to oceanic islands that may be associated with elevated extinction risk. These analyses have been conducted separately for traits that have been recorded as dichotomous and traits that are continuous. I first test if  (1) ground nesting, (2) dichromatic, (3) poor-flight ability or flightlessness is associated with increased extinction risk. Here the extinction risk scale runs from zero to five (lower risk=0, near threatened=l, vulnerable=2, endangered=3, critically endangered=4, and extinct or extinct in the wild=5). The effect o f a species’ total distribution and minimum distance from the mainland are controlled for independently in each o f the analyses. Results are presented where they influence the overall significance o f the association between the term o f interest and extinction risk. As with the previous analyses, independent contrasts are calculated using theChapter 5: Avian extinction risk on oceanic islands_____________________________________113BRUNCH algorithm from CAIC (Comparative approach, page 29) and contrasts are compared using Wilcoxon’s test.I then test whether species with (1) smaller clutches, (2) larger body length, (3) increased sexual size dimorphism, and (4) habitat specialism are associated with increased extinction risk. Again the extinction risk scale runs from zero to five. Independent contrasts are calculated using BRUNCH (Comparative approach, page 29). Linear regression through the origin is used to analyse the contrasts, with threatened status as the dependent variable and the specific trait in question as the independent variable. As the variables were continuous it is possible also to calculate contrasts to control for total distribution and distance from the mainland. I also control for latitude since body size (reviewed by Gaston and Blackburn 2000) and clutch size (reviewed by Grant 1998) have both been shown to be correlated with latitude. In addition, latitude may have an influence on the number o f habitat types that are available for an island bird. These results are given where there is a significant relationship between the term in question and extinction risk. Stepwise regression was employed to identify the minimum adequate model.The past 1000 yearsAll analyses examining life history, ecological, or morphological traits associated with elevated extinction risk were also run for a subset o f birds whose total range is restricted to oceanic islands that were colonised by humans within the last 1000 years. This has been done to identify whether extinction filters influence the traits that are identified as associated with greater extinction risk.Introduced speciesFinally, to identify birds with traits that may be particularly susceptible to introduced species the analyses are also run considering only species threatened by introductions. The extinction risk scale runs from 0-3 (0=lower risk, l=vulnerable, 2=endangered, and 3=critically endangered). All seven life history, ecological, or morphological characteristics are considered in these analyses.Chapter 5: Avian extinction risk on oceanic islands_____________________________________114ResultsIsland/mainlandThere appears to be no significant difference between the extinction risk o f island and mainland restricted-range species (Table 5.1). There is however, a non-significant trend for oceanic-island restricted-range birds to be more threatened. The analyses further indicate that oceanic-island restricted-range birds are not significantly more threatened by exploitation or habitat loss, but are significantly threatened by introduced species. If the analyses are run separately for passerines and non-passerines the results are similar for both groups (Table 5.2; Table 5.3).Chapter 5: Avian extinction risk on oceanic islands____________________________________Table 5.1.

As with the analysis including all restricted-range species, there is no significant difference between island and mainland restricted-range species in relation to the threat o f habitat loss or exploitation. In this analysis island species also remain disproportionately threatened by introduced species (n=91, Z—3.42, p<0.001).Chapter 5: Avian extinction risk on oceanic islands___________________________________Correlates o f extinctionWithin oceanic islands, flightless or nearly flightless birds are at greater risk of extinction than birds capable o f flight (Table 5.4). There is a near-significant trend for ground nesters to be more threatened than tree nesters. This trend becomes weaker however, when I control for a species’ distribution (Table 5.4). There is no significant relationship between a species’ risk o f extinction and dichromatism.Table 5.4. The relationship between extinction risk and ground nesting, dichromatism, and flightlessness.

Body size is also not correlated with extinction risk (Table 5.5), even when large (>=27 cm) or small (<27 cm) species are analysed separately (large, n=54, t=0.67, p=0.51; small, n=83, t=0.91, p=0.36). Species where there is an increased difference in body size between the sexes are not at greater risk o f extinction than species that are less sexually size dimorphic (Table 5.5). Finally, habitat specialists are at greater risk o f extinction than habitat generalists (Table 5.5; Figure 5.1). This relationship is maintained if  I control for species’ total distribution, minimum distance from the mainland, and average latitude (Table 5.6).116Chapter 5: Avian extinction risk on oceanic islandsTable 5.5.

Three o f the results were different from the analyses including birds from islands that were colonised more than 1000 years ago. The correlation between ground nesting and extinction risk becomes significant (n=10, Z=-2.67, p=0.008) and this correlation remains significant when one controls for a species’ distribution and distance from the mainland (ground nesting controlling for distribution, n=10, Z—2.80, p=0.005; controlling for distance, n=10, Z=-2.70, p=0.007). The relationship between flightless birds being at greater risk o f extinction falls below significance, although a non­significant trend remains (n=9, Z=-1.40, p=0.16).Large bodied birds are associated with greater risk o f  extinction (n=34, R2=0.17, coefficient=2.64, t=2.61, p=0.013) (Figure 5.2) and this remains significant if  I control for species total distribution, minimum distance from the mainland, and average latitude (Table 5.7).

Large bodied birds tend to be at greater risk of extinction.119DiscussionIsland/mainland comparisonThe island/mainland comparison o f restricted-range species indicates that the risk of extinction for the two groups is similar, but that the processes o f  extinction are slightly different. These results are similar for passerines and non-passerines and robust to the removal o f island species with ranges smaller than 10,000 km2. Island and mainland restricted-range birds are similar in their vulnerability to habitat loss and exploitation, but oceanic island birds are much more threatened due to introduced species.Island restricted-range birds differ from mainland restricted-range species in a number o f aspects that may either increase or decrease their susceptibility to specific extinction processes. First, there is a filter on the type o f species that get to islands and are able to persist for long enough to become endemic (Salomonsen 1974). Thus, birds that are found on islands have demonstrated an ability to adapt to a novel environment and persist within a restricted distribution for a long period o f time. The restricted range o f island birds is not necessarily a reflection o f their inability to compete or a result of habitat specialisation; they are restricted by a fixed geographic barrier. Density compensation may be common on islands since there are fewer competitors and predators (MacArthur et al. 1972). High population densities may be particularly important for reducing extinction risk in a restricted-range environment (Manne et al 1999; Chapter 7). However, evolutionary or ecological adaptations that occur in a species-poor environment with few competitors and predators may result in oceanic island birds being more threatened than mainland birds by the introduction o f exotic species (Williamson 1981). Many o f the traits associated with island birds becoming more prone to extinction are discussed here such as flightlessness, ground nesting, and reduced reproductive rates.Mainland restricted-range species tend to have small distributions because they are not able to compete or they are dependent on a specific habitat type or resource. Their distributions have either always been small or their range size has decreased over time, the latter will make them particularly vulnerable. The abundance o f  species with restricted distributions tends to be lower than broadly-distributed species (Gaston et al. 1997; Gaston and Lawton 1990). This relationship is unlikely to hold if  island and mainland species are compared as island species often express density compensation (see Blackburn et al. 1997). However, among islands, the general trend may exist. TheChapter 5: Avian extinction risk on oceanic islands________________________________________120low abundance levels associated with restricted-range mainland species may result in an elevated risk o f extinction for this group o f species. However, mainland birds have had evolutionary history with a broad range o f predators and competitors and this may make them less susceptible than island species to introductions and human exploitation.Humans have introduced species throughout the world (Vermeij 1991) and the extremely high vulnerability o f island birds to this specific extinction process indicates an intrinsic susceptibility. Although the introduction o f exotic species is still a significant threat, it is possible that most o f the extinctions due to this process have now taken place (King 1985). This view is supported by the fact that fewer birds are threatened due to introduced species on islands that have been colonised by humans for a greater period o f time (Chapter 3) than on more recently colonised islands. Assuming that extensive extinctions have already occurred as a result o f introduced species, then island restricted-range birds were likely to be much more extinction prone than mainland restricted-range birds in the recent past, even after controlling for the effect of distribution. Extremely high prehistoric extinction rates among island birds is supported by the subfossil records o f extinct birds (Pimm et al. 1994; Steadman 1995; James 1995). Past estimates o f bird extinctions on islands are as high as one fifth o f all birds extant during the Holocene (Milberg and Tyrberg 1993).However, exploitation, and to a lesser extent habitat destruction, have also been implicated in this wave o f island bird extinctions (Diamond 1984, Paulay 1994; Steadman 1995; Holdaway and Jacomb 2000). Although there is, at present, no significant difference between island and mainland restricted-range birds in relation to exploitation, it would appear that traits such as flightlessness or tameness may make island birds especially susceptible to this process o f extinction. It is possible that species particularly susceptible to exploitation such as the extinct moas (Holdaway 1999) and as many as 2000 flightless rails (Steadman 1995) may have already been exterminated from islands in part due to human exploitation. With these vulnerable species now gone, threat rates due to exploitation between island and mainland birds would be similar. The extinction filter effect (Chapter 3 ,4 ) and the subfossil record, including extinct species from larger islands (Duncan and Blackburn submitted) indicates that similar threat rates o f island and mainland restricted-range-birds is a relatively new phenomenon.Chapter 5: Avian extinction risk on oceanic islands_____________________________________121Correlates o f extinctionHabitat specialists and birds that are flightless or poorly-flighted are associated with a greater risk o f extinction on oceanic islands. If  birds that inhabit islands that have been colonised by humans for more than 1000 years are excluded, then ground nesters and large bodied birds are also associated with elevated extinction risk. For this second analysis the relationship between flightless or poorly flighted birds and extinction risk falls just below significance, but the sample size is very small and the trend remains.The non-significant relationship o f ground-nesting species and large-bodied birds with extinction risk, in the analyses including all island birds, may indicate that the particularly vulnerable birds with these traits have already been filtered from islands colonised for a long period o f time. Thus, the subset o f ground nesters and flightless birds that remain on islands colonised in the distant past may be resilient to human- related threats. This filtration effect bias makes it difficult to identify ground nesting and large body size as an extinction prone trait. This demonstrates the difficulties that may arise when the relationships between life history or ecological traits and extinction risk are explored without making a distinction between regions where an extinction filter has occurred and regions where an extinction filter is in progress. It also illustrates that life history or ecological traits shown to be associated with increased extinction risk for species in one region may not always applicable to another.There is strong support for the result that ground nesters and flightless or poorly- flighted birds have historically been at greater risk o f  extinction (Diamond 1984; Steadman 1995) than flighted and non-ground nesting birds. This is also supported by the finding that flightless or poorly-flighted birds and ground nesters are less prevalent on islands that have been colonised by humans for a long period o f time (Chapter 4). While it is difficult to know whether the species are threatened due to being flightless or being ground nesters (see Duncan and Blackburn submitted), both traits are likely to be associated with elevated extinction risk from exploitation and introduced species, resulting in a double jeopardy for flightless birds.Species that have been classified as habitat specialists represent a gradient o f  birds ranging from species that are highly adapted to a specific habitat type to those that have been recently restricted in range due to exploitation, predation, disease, or competition. In general, habitat specialists may be more threatened because they are less able to adapt to a human-modified environment. They may also be restricted to small areasChapter 5: Avian extinction risk on oceanic islands_____________________________________122Chapter 5: Avian extinction risk on oceanic islandswithin islands, making them susceptible to habitat destruction, as well as other threat processes. Forest specialists are by far the most common habitat specialists on islands (Stattersfield et al. 1998) and are particularly threatened because the last remaining refuges are now being deforested (Simberloff 2000) on most islands. However, levels o f threat may be particularly high for forest specialists because more forest endemics and species now restricted to forest habitats have escaped past extinction filters. This view is supported by the fact that there appear to be fewer non-forest restricted specialists on islands that have been colonised for a long period o f time (Chapter 4). Thus, when forest specialists are compared to other island endemic birds they may appear to be disproportionately threatened simply because the extinction process has been much slower for species that have been able to persist in refuges o f native or near­native forest habitat.Although this analysis demonstrates that there is an association between habitat specialists and extinction risk, it does not necessarily support the theory o f the taxon cycle. The taxon cycle predicts that during the process o f  becoming more endemic, species become increasingly restricted in distribution because they are not able to compete with new generalist colonisers (Rickleffs and Cox 1972). This is supported by the observation that highly endemic species are often restricted to ‘interior’ forest habitat (Wilson 1961; Rickleffs and Cox 1972; Ricklefs and Bermingham 1999). However, these observations rely on patterns that have occurred subsequent to humans completely modifying island environments. The distribution and relative threatened status o f highly endemic species was most likely very different in the past. Thus, even if  highly endemic species are at present restricted to few habitat types and are at great risk o f extinction, it is not necessarily true that a natural cycle exists, where generalists to arrive on islands, become increasingly specialised and ultimately extinct.The greater extinction risk associated with birds o f  longer body length on islands supports the general trend for large species to be at greater extinction risk (e.g. Gaston and Blackburn 1995; Bennett and Owens 1997). In general, large body size may make species susceptible to human exploitation (Diamond 1984; Owens and Bennett 2000). Large body size is associated with low rates o f intrinsic increase and low abundance. These traits combined with a restricted range, which limits total population size, may make large-bodied species particularly susceptible to human-related threat processes.As previously discussed, large-bodied species that are prone to extinction may have123already been removed from many o f the islands colonised for more than 1000 years. However, it is interesting to note that there is no significant difference in the body size o f endemic birds found on islands recently colonised by humans and those colonised in the distant past (Chapter 4).The relationship between clutch size and extinction risk on islands is not significant.This is contrary to the general trend for mainland birds to be more threatened if  they have a smaller clutch size (Bennett and Owens 1997). It is interesting to note that clutch size decreases with a species’ range size on islands (Chapter 2). If  this is also the case on the mainland, then clutch size may be acting as a surrogate for small range size, which is known to be associated with a high extinction probability (Caughley 1994; Simberloff 1998). If  one controls for range size, there may also be no relationship between fecundity and extinction risk on the mainland.Similarly, there does not appear to be any relationship between sexual size dimorphism or dichromatism and extinction risk on islands. This implies that there is no relationship between extinction risk and intense sexual selection. There are however, mechanisms other than sexual selection that may play a role in the expression o f dichromatism (Mayr 1942, Amadon 1953; Herremans 1990) and sexual body size dimorphism (Selander 1966; Chapter 2). As discussed in the Introduction, there may be costs associated with sexual body size dimorphism and dichromatism. However, there may also be benefits associated with these traits in a restricted-range island environment. For example, a relationship has been demonstrated between sexual body size dimorphism and high levels o f social polygamy, as well as large differences in parental care (Owens and Hartley 1998). In a restricted-range environment, where species are more prone to demographic stochasticity, a polygamous breeding strategy may be advantageous (see Legendre et al. 1999). If  sexual body size dimorphism is strongly influenced by niche partitioning between the sexes on islands (Selander 1966; Keast 1996) this adaptation may enable species to live at higher population densities and therefore reduce their exposure to extinction. There is a commonly observed trend for island birds to become less dichromatic (Mayr 1942, Amadon 1953; Sibley 1957; Grant 1965; Herremans 1990). I f  the change from dichromatism to monochromatism is associated with highly endemic species, then species classified as dichromatic may have a slightly lower extinction risk as more endemic species have been shown to be at greater risk o f extinction (see McDowall 1969; Duncan and Blackburn submitted). Thus, while thereChapter 5: Avian extinction risk on oceanic islands_____________________________________124Chapter 5: Avian extinction risk on oceanic islands__________________________________may be costs to sexually selected traits, these may be balanced with benefits associated with dichromatism and sexual size dimorphism.No correlations were found between species threat by the introduction o f exotics and any o f the life history, ecological, or morphological traits tested. This is possibly due to the fact that species classified as threatened by introductions include a broad range of processes. For example, a species threatened by introductions may be susceptible to competitors, predators and habitat modifiers, all o f which probably target species with slightly different traits. If the analyses were run with these processes more clearly divided then those traits correlated with elevated extinction risk might emerge.However, it is very interesting that flightlessness or ground nesting are not particularly vulnerable traits in this subset o f  species. Perhaps this has to do with the difficulty in distinguishing proximate from ultimate processes o f extinction, and disentangling synergistic threat processes.Island and mainland threat processes may now be similar with the exception o f introduced species. Many o f the island species that are particularly susceptible to introductions have most likely already gone extinct. As the process o f extinction by introduced species runs its course and habitat loss intensifies, there will be even greater similarities between the processes o f extinction on islands and the mainland. There are specific traits o f island birds that are associated with a heightened risk o f extinction. However, these appear to vary depending on whether or not a region has long experienced human-related threats. The presence or absence o f extinction filters has major implications for studies that try to identify traits that make species extinction prone so they can be used to make predictions about which species may be at greatest risk o f extinction. First, it may be difficult to identify traits associated with extinction prone birds if  data is collected from areas where a specific extinction filter has occurred, as well as areas where the extinction filter is occurring. Second, if  traits are identified in a region where a specific extinction filter is occurring, those findings may not be applicable to regions where that extinction filter has already run its course or a different extinction filter is in progress. This highlights the temporal nature o f  susceptible traits and the importance o f  understanding historic threat processes in any attempt to identify which species are likely to be at the greatest risk o f extinction.125R eferen cesAmadon, D. 1953.

The results from this study have been combined with past research in order to assess trends in abundance, to determine the overall conservation status o f the birds and to identify essential habitats for the threatened species and subspecies. This research is particularly important as the government has been considering large-scale economic development plans for the island o f Principe, and has recently signed an oil exploration agreement with Nigeria that may lead to rapid development. Based on this research, two of the seven endemic birds qualify as Vulnerable to extinction under the IUCN Categories and Criteria, due to their restricted range. Two o f the eight endemic subspecies qualify as Critically Endangered, and another one as Vulnerable. No endemic bird extinctions have been recorded, and endemics remain the most common birds on the island. The maintenance o f forest in the mountain and sections o f the southern lowlands has undoubtedly played a strong role in the persistence and continued dominance o f the endemic avifauna. This native and late-successional forest is presently essential habitat for one o f the threatened species and four o f the threatened endemic subspecies and its protection is required for their future persistence.Chapter 6: Conservation status of the endemic birds of Principe__________________________132IntroductionPrincipe is a small island in the Gulf o f Guinea with unusually high numbers o f single island endemic birds given the small size o f the island (Jones 1994) and its relative proximity to the mainland. However, little is known about the distribution and status of the island's unique avifauna (Christy 1996). This is o f particular concern as the government recently considered a proposal to designate 36% of the island as a free- trade zone (WADCO 1999). At present it does not look like the free-trade zone will be implemented. However, the government has just agreed to set up a joint oil exploration zone with Nigeria (Irin 2000) which will potentially lead to rapid development o f the island. If  such development were to occur, there would be very little baseline data from which declines could be determined, or information to determine which sections o f the island are particularly important for the persistence o f specific endemic birds.Up until this study, we have been dependent on reports from Keulemans (1866), Dohm (1866), Boyd Alexander (1909) (see Bannerman 1914), and Correia (1929) for information on the status and distribution o f the endemic birds for large sections o f the island. The high central mountains had not been explored since the time of Correia (1929) and some of the higher peaks o f the island, such as the Pico do Principe, had never been visited by ornithologists (Christy and Clarke 1998). Since the time of Correia (1929) only small sections o f the southern lowland forest have been explored (see Christy and Clarke 1998). Studies subsequent to Correia have focused primarily on the easily-accessible northern section o f the island (Snow 1950; Frade 1958; de Naurois 1973,1975,1980,1983, 1988,1994; Jones and Tye 1988; Harrison and Steel 1989; Sargent 1994; Atkinson et al. 1991; Christy and Clarke 1998) (for a review of ornithological study on Principe see Jones and Tye 1988; Jones and Tye 2001).The focus o f this study is the least-known section o f the island, the mountain forest in the central to southern section o f the island down to the southern lowland forest. With an understanding o f the status o f the species that live in the mountain forest and southern lowland forest, it is possible to comment on the conservation status o f  all the endemic species and subspecies o f Principe and identify essential habitat for threatened endemics. Understanding their distribution and conservation status will help to identify whether this community o f species has been truly resilient to human-related threats, and if  so, may provide insight into the conditions necessary for the long term persistence o f island endemic species.Chapter 6: Conservation status of the endemic birds of Principe__________________________133Chapter 6: Conservation status of the endemic birds of PrincipeBackground to PrincipeGeography and ClimatePrincipe is 220 km from the African mainland in the Gulf o f Guinea (Juste and Fa 1994) with a total area o f 139 km2 and a maximum elevation o f 945 m. In conjunction with Sao Tomé, the islands form the Democratic Republic o f  Sao Tomé e Príncipe. Both Sáo Tomé and Príncipe were formed by volcanic eruptions (Lee et al 1994) and have never been connected to the mainland or each other (Exell 1944; Amadon 1953). The topography o f the island is relatively flat in the north but becomes increasingly hilly towards the central and southern regions with numerous deep valleys that taper off into the rocky lowland forest in the south-west section o f the island. The climate is equatorial with rainfall in the north averaging 1,000 mm and up to 5,000 mm in the south (Johnson 1988), and monthly temperatures range between 25 and 31 °C (Bredero et al. 1977). Each year there are two dry seasons and two wet seasons. The driest months are July to August, and the end o f December to the beginning o f January. The wettest months are October, November, March and April.Land use historyIn 1471 the Portuguese discovered the completely forested and uninhabited island o f Principe (Hodges and Newitt 1988). Settlers arrived in the early 1500s and engaged in sugar cane production (largely restricted to the north), the slave trade and subsistence farming. By 1580 the sugar cane industry went into decline and was not replaced by another significant commercial crop until the beginning o f the 19th century with the introduction o f coffee and cocoa (Bredero et al. 1977). Large plantations only began in the late 19th century and were largely devoted to cocoa. Between 1893 and 1900 three large estates were formed in the southern and central uninhabited section o f the island (Baillie and Gascoigne in preparation). At the end o f the 1800s most o f the north had been cultivated (Bannerman 1914) and large sections o f the southern lowlands cleared or modified. However, the central mountains and sections o f  the southwest remained as primary forest (Jones et al. 1991; Baillie and Gascoigne in preparation).134Chapter 6: Conservation status of the endemic birds of Principe Figure 6.1. Map of Principe in the Gulf of Guinea.Cocoa production reached its peak on Principe in 1913 (Vasconcellos 1918). From 1920 onward agricultural production declined sharply as a result of poor soil, disease, and labour shortages. As a result, plantations were abandoned in the southwest in the early 20th century. Plantations such as Infante D. Henrique along the southeast coast and Maria Correia in the south/central eastern region (Figure 6.1) were abandoned shortly after independence in 1975. Now the section of the island south of pico do Principe is completely abandoned. Agricultural production has continued in the northern section of the island to the present, although it is now mostly subsistence level135Chanter 6: Conservation status of the endemic birds of Principe__________________________farming.Exploitation and Introduced speciesDuring the colonial period much o f the island was accessible due to extensive cultivation (Bannerman 1914), and exploitation was likely to have been a significant threat for some species. Keulemans (1866) noted that the endemic pigeons and doves were heavily hunted around towns and that other birds such as olive ibis Bostrychia olivácea rothschildi and Principe glossy starling Lamprotornis ornatus were hunted for food. The following mammals have been introduced to Principe over the past 500 years: ship rat (Rattus rattus), Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus), house mouse (Mus musculus), mona monkey (Cercopithecus mona), domestic cats, dogs, goats, pigs, sheep, cattle, donkeys, horses (Dutton 1994), and civet (Civettictis civetta) (Bruto da Costa et al. 1916). Thus, most mammalian culprits o f island bird extinctions have been documented on Principe, with the exception o f weasels and mongoose, and habitat modifiers such as rabbits and deer. Birds known to have been introduced to the island, and which may be competitors with native species or vectors o f disease, are laughing dove (Streptopelia senegalensis) (Snow 1950), feral pigeons (Columba livia) and chickens.AvifaunaThere are approximately 33 breeding land birds on Principe (Jones and Tye 2001), o f which seven are restricted to Principe, one o f these seven, Horizorhinus, being a monospecific genus. A further five are restricted to both Sao Tomé (150 km to the south-west) and Principe, three o f which have a different subspecies on each island (Peet and Atkinson 1994). A further four subspecies are endemic to Principe and two more subspecies are restricted to the G ulf o f Guinea.In Threatened Birds o f the World (2000) none o f the endemic birds o f  Principe were listed as threatened at the species level, however, the endemic Principe drongo Dicrurus modestus and speirops speirops leucophaeus were classified as Near Threatened. Principe white-eye Zosterops ficedulinus was listed as Vulnerable and G ulf o f Guinea thrush Turdus olivaceofus xanthorhynchusas as Near Threatened, both o f which have a subspecies on Principe and Sáo Tomé, and in both cases the subspecies is rarer on Príncipe. I am only aware o f the thrush being recorded three times since its discovery in 1901 (see Jones and Tye 2001) and Principe white-eye being sighted twice since de136Chapter 6: Conservation status of the endemic birds of Principe__________________________Naurois in 1972 or 1973 (de Naurois 1983). Past documentation o f the islands subspecies indicated that, in addition to Principe white-eye and Gulf o f Guinea thrush, other endemic subspecies may be threatened or extremely rare such as Principe seedeater Poliospiza rufobrunnea rufobrunnea, olive Ibis, and the postulated endemic owl (Atkinson et al. 1991). There have been various reports on the status o f Principe seedeater on Principe ranging from virtually extinct in accessible areas (Atkinson et al. 1991) to common (Keulemans 1866; Snow 1950). The status o f olive ibis is even less well known as there have only been three reported sightings over the past 100 years (see de Naurois 1973, Sargent 1994; Jones and Tye 2001). The owl is a still greater enigma. De Naurois noted hearing an owl call near the airport (de Naurois 1975) and postulated that it may be an endemic species. Many o f the above species and subspecies were reported to inhabit the mountain forest and southern lowland forest at the beginning o f last century, but their current status in the south o f the island has been uncertain. The mountain forest and southern lowland forest combined account for more than 30% of the island's landmass. The presence or absence and relative abundance o f these species in the mountain forest and southern lowlands has major implications for their overall conservation status.MethodsThis study is the result o f field research conducted from the 30th o f August to 7th of October, 1999. Data on the distribution and abundance o f the island's birds were collected while spending 16 days in the mountain forest and eight days in the southern lowland forest. The mountain forest is defined as the area above 250 meters south of Sao Joaquim (c20 km2) and the southern lowland forest is below 250 m south o f the peak o f A Mesa, Pico do Principe and Pico Meneóme (c25 km2) (Figure 6.1). This study focuses on the endemic species and subspecies restricted to Principe. However, species restricted to Principe and the other islands in the G ulf o f Guinea, and the African grey parrot Psittacus erithacus, are also included as they are restricted-range species or populations o f conservation concern. The scientific names o f the endemic birds follow Peet and Atkinson (1994) with the exclusion o f olive sunbird Nectarinia olivácea cephaelis, that is no longer believed to be an endemic subspecies (Jones and Tye 2001). The common names follow Christy and Clarke (1998) and the sequence of species follows Jones and Tye (1988). Relative and absolute abundance were estimated in the central mountain and southern lowland forest. For relative abundance, species were categorised by the number o f sightings per day (see Table 6.1). This method is137Chapter 6: Conservation status of the endemic birds of Principe________________________consistent with earlier methods used for estimating relative abundance (Atkinson et al 1991).For estimates o f absolute abundance, distance sampling with point counts on line transects was employed (see Buckland et al 1993). Ninety eight point counts were carried out in the mountain forest and seventy in the southern lowland forest. At each point two minutes were spent waiting for the birds to settle. Numbers o f birds and their distance were then estimated for the following five minutes. In the southern lowland forest stratified random sampling was used (see Bibby et al 1998). Following an old road that runs along the south end o f the island, transect lines were paced out at 200 m intervals from Barriga Branca to Antonio Enes (Figure 6.1). In total there were 25 transect lines. These transect lines were divided into groups o f five o f  which one group o f five was randomly selected each day. The transect line within the group o f five and the starting point (top, middle, bottom) was then randomly selected. If  the middle selection was chosen a coin was tossed to select the direction. Once one o f the five groups o f transects had been selected it was not considered for subsequent selections. If the selected transect line was completed, (above 250 m) or it was impossible to continue, a coin would be tossed to determine whether to continue on the transect line to the right or the left. All transects were walked along a 60° north-east axis. All point counts were taken between 6:30 and 11:00 am. During this time the forest was almost always covered in cloud and the temperature remained relatively constant ranging from 25.6 to 27 °C. Ninety-four percent o f the point counts were based on call only.Due to the topography, strati fied-random sampling was not possible in the mountain forest. In this region, transects followed navigable routes and point counts were conducted at 200 m intervals on alternate sides o f the line at a perpendicular distance of 50 m (see Jones et al 1995). The mountain region was first explored to identify accessible routes. Transects were carried out on Pico Mesa, Pico do Príncipe, Carriote, and Pico Meneóme above 250 m (Figure 6.1). In the mountain rainforest point counts were conducted whenever the rain permitted during daylight hours. Point counts would138Chapter 6: Conservation status of the endemic birds of Principe________________________not be resumed until 20 minutes after a rain shower. The mountains were covered in cloud throughout the study and the temperature ranged from 18 to 24 °C. Again, 94% of the point counts were based on calls.These data were analysed using Distance Software 3.5 (Thomas et al 1998). Various distance bands were applied using post stratification (between 4 to 8 bands). The most distant band was set so that approximately 5% of the most distant estimates would be removed from the analysis. The encounter rate variance was estimated empirically (Buckland et al 1993) to provide an abundance estimate with 95% confidence intervals (Table 6.1). For some o f the extremely rare species the detection function o f other ecologically similar Principe species were used to enable a rough estimate o f abundance. These have been conducted to provide a density estimate o f the most rare species, but should be treated with caution.This study, in conjunction with other past and recent research, has been used to provide an estimate o f the distribution and conservation status o f  the endemic species and subspecies o f  Príncipe. Their conservation status has been assessed using the IUCN categories and criteria (1994). The IUCN Categories and Criteria have been applied to subspecies to highlight the extinction risk faced by these unique populations. This is particularly important in situations such as on Principe where some o f the subspecies are not well studied and further investigation could result in their elevation to full species status. The IUCN Categories and Criteria are not applied to the G ulf o f Guinea endemic species with distributions greater than Principe as their distribution and status outside o f Príncipe is beyond the scope o f this study. However, the African grey parrot has been assessed as it may be a geographically isolated population and is presently o f conservation concern due to harvesting.ResultsSee tabel 6.1.139Chapter 6: Conservation status of the endemic birds of PrincipeTable 6.1. Relative and absolute abundance and maximum and minimum elevation of endemic species and subspecies of bird in the mountain forest and the southern lowland forest. The African grey parrot and birds endemic to Príncipe as well as the Gulf of Guinea are also included. Absolute abundance estimates in bold should be interpreted with caution as their detection function is based on a more common species. The initials are given of the scientific name of species used as the detection function for a rare species.

Other subspecies are found on the African mainland. Status and DistributionAfter extensive searches in the mountain and southern lowland forest it was not seen or heard. The olive ibis is believed to have always been rare in the south o f the island. Dohm (1866) found it in the almost inaccessible rocky and forested localities in the south, seeing them daily for two weeks and hearing them crowing like ravens.Keulemans (1866) found them only in forest o f the south and west. Fea collected one more specimen in 1901 (Salvadori 1903). De Naurois (1994) reports a sighting in 1973, the last published documentation until Sargeant reported a sighting in August 1991 (Sargeant 1994). Christy and Clarke (1998) believe that the ibis still exists in the south and central primary forest with a restricted distribution o f 40 km2, citing disturbance at the nest by mona monkeys as a possible explanation o f its rarity. Keulemans (1866) stated that it was also hunted for food. If this subspecies is not extinct its total distribution is extremely restricted.Threatened Status: Critically Endangered D.G reen pigeon Treron calva virescensEndemic subspecies to Principe and the islet o f Bone do Joquei. Other subspecies are found on Bioko and the African mainland.Status and DistributionFrequent in the southern lowland forest up to 300 m, but not observed in the mountain forest (Table 6.1). Dohm (1866) documented it as very common throughout the island. Keulemans (1866) described it as the most common dove on the island, referring to parties o f 30 to 50 birds feeding in tall fruiting trees. It was recorded as common to abundant by de Naurois (1983) as well as by Jones and Tye (1988); who found it along forest edge and re-growth. Atkinson e t al. (1991) only saw it twice during their four- day stay. Christy and Clarke (1998) found it common in cocoa plantation and forest- edge habitat. This species was historically hunted (Keulemans 1866) and continues to be hunted (Jones and Tye 1988) on a small scale (pers. obs.). The total present estimated distribution and status is frequent to common in plantations, secondary forest, and edge habitat at lower elevations in the north, rare in the southern lowland forest and rare to absent in the mountain forest.T hreatened S ta tus: Near Threatened141Chapter 6: Conservation status of the endemic birds of PrincipeLemon dove Aplopelia larvata principalisEndemic subspecies to Principe. Other subspecies are found on Sáo Tomé, Annobon, Bioko and mainland Africa.Status and DistributionCommon in the southern lowland and mountain forest up to 750m. It is the only dove found to be common in the primary forest (Table 6.1). Keulemans (1866) found it to be more common than the Gulf o f  Guinea bronze-naped pigeon and occurring throughout the island. Boyd Alexander in 1909 documented it as common in the plantations (Bannerman 1914) as did Snow (1950) who also found them common in the hill forest. Jones and Tye (1988) documented it as common to abundant in heavily shaded cocoa plantations and dense secondary forest. Atkinson et al. (1991) only saw one lemon dove during their four-day visit. Christy and Clarke (1998) recorded it as common from the coast to high-altitude forest. The total present estimated distribution and status is frequent to common in plantations, secondary forest, edge habitat along roads and paths as well as in primary forest up to 750m.Threatened status: Lower Risk lc.G ulf of G uinea bronze-naped pigeon Columba malherbiiEndemic species to Príncipe, Sáo Tomé and Annobon.Status and DistributionFrequent in the southern lowland forest and rare in the mountain forest with a maximum observed elevation o f 750 m (Table 6.1). However, locals claim that it is more common in the mountain forest during the dry season. Keulemans (1866) recorded it as most common in the higher parts o f  Príncipe. Dohm (1866) found it to be very rare, having only seen it a few times during his six month stay. Jones and Tye (1988) found it frequently in forests and plantations with tall trees and Atkinson et al. (1991) reported flocks o f  up to 30 individuals seen in the north, but classified it as frequent to common. Christy and Clarke (1998) found it in all habitat types but less common in the south­west forest. Keulemans (1866) cites hunting as the cause o f rarity in the inhabited zones at lower elevation. Its total present estimated distribution and status is frequent to common in plantations and secondary lowland forest throughout the island and rare in the mountain forest.142Chapter 6: Conservation status of the endemic birds of Principe_______________________African grey p a rro t Psittacus erithacus Afrotropical including Principe, Bioko and Sáo Tomé.Taxonom yDebate remains over its subspecific status on Principe. Boyd Alexander suggested it should be considered as a separate species from the African grey parrot (in Bannerman 1914) and recommended the name Psittacus princeps. Bannerman (1914) treated it as a subspecies Psittacus erithacus princeps. Amadon (1953), de Naurois (1983) and Christy and Clarke (1998) stated the subspecies is no longer valid. However, the matter is still under investigation (Martim de Melo, unpublished).Status and DistributionVery common in the southern lowland forest and the mountain forest up to 700 m at which point the trees begin to become smaller (Table 6.1). Dohm (1866) and Keulemans (1866) found grey parrots very common. Boyd Alexander in 1909 wrote that they were still fairly numerous, but had no doubt declined due to deforestation (Bannerman 1914). Snow (1950) De Naurois (1983), Jones and Tye (1988), Christy and Clarke (1998) all found them common throughout the island. Apparently there are two major roosting sites, one around the Pico Papagaio and the other nearby Pico Negro (Snow 1950), but this warrants further investigation (Harrison and Steele 1989) as they are abundant throughout the south-west forest in the evening in August and September (pers. obs.). In the past they were hunted for food (Keulemans 1866, Bannerman 1914) and are now harvested for the pet trade (Melo 1998). Their present estimated status and distribution is very common throughout the island up to 700 m and most abundant where large trees are found.Threatened Status: Near ThreatenedEm erald  cuckoo Chrysococcyx cupreus insularumEndemic subspecies to Príncipe, Sáo Tomé and Annobon. The other subspecies is on the mainland and Bioko.Status and DistributionRare in the southern lowland forest and not heard or seen in the mountain forest above 250 m. However, locals claim that it can be found up to 750 m in the dry season (Table6.1). This corresponds with the observations o f Dohm (1866) and Keulemans (1866) who stated that the cuckoo lives in the southern mountain section o f the island during the dry season, and the lower forest during the wet season. It was heard but not seen by Snow (1950) and Jones and Tye in 1988 (Jones and Tye 2001). Harrison and Steele143Chapter 6: Conservation status of the endemic birds of Principe__________________________(1989) considered it common and Atkinson et al. (1994) recorded it as frequent around Bom Bom in the north. Christy and Clarke (1998) document it as present in all forested habitats, particularly shaded plantations and primary forest but noted that it is less abundant than its counterpart on S&o Tomé. The total present estimated distribution and status is restricted primarily to, and is frequent in, dense lowland forest and shaded plantations and rare in the mountain forest.Scops owl Otus sp?Heard on Principe by de Naurois near the airport in 1974 (de Naurois 1975). Despite searches in the evenings and the use o f playbacks o f Otus hartlaubi (from S&o Tomé), the species reported by de Naurois was not heard or seen during the month spent in the forest o f Principe. The existence o f this species is very questionable. A forest guide who lives next to the airport, where de Naurois heard an owl calling, has never heard a bird calling at night. Another guide, who lives and works in the forest, stated that he has only seen one in his life in 1993. He saw it huddled in a tree at Pico Zau in the south-west, but never heard it call. It is possible that a species o f owl periodically lands on Principe, but based on the lack o f sightings and the lack o f  calls, it is unlikely that the island maintains a viable population. However, species such as the Scops owls have been known to persist at very low population densities and to escape observation for decades (Safford 1993) and Annobon, a much smaller island in the Gulf o f Guinea, has its own endemic subspecies. I f  this owl truly exists and it is endemic, it is restricted to an extremely small area.Threatened Status: Critically Endangered D.Little swift Apus affinis bannermaniEndemic subspecies to Principe and S&o Tomé. The other subspecies is from mainland Africa.Status and DistributionFrequent in the very southern section o f Principe and absent above 250m in elevation. Keulemans (1866) observed it throughout the island including the forest o f the uninhabited parts. Dohm documented it as common near the town (Bannerman 1914). Jones and Tye (1988) found it abundant over clearings, in plantations and in secondary forest in the north. Atkinson et al (1991) reported it as common in the north. Christy and Clarke (1998) stated they are found throughout the island particularly along the Rio Papagaio. Its present estimated distribution and status is common in the northern section144Chapter 6: Conservation status of the endemic birds of Principe_______________________of the island around the larger plantations, in both open areas and secondary forest. It is also common near the town o f Santo Antonio, and along the coast where large inlets are present. However, it is not common in the south and rare to absent above 250 m.Sao Tomé spinetail Chaetura thomensis Endemic species to Principe and Sáo Tomé.Status and DistributionIt is rarely seen in the south-west section o f the island, as there is very little open habitat and was not observed above 250 m (Table 6.1). However, it is common in the south­east and south-west/central regions along the coast and in open areas often at the site o f abandoned plantations. Jones and Tye (1988) found it frequently in the east and north­west over plantations, forest clearings and valleys. Atkinson et al (1991) observed it in similar habitat and documented it as common. Christy and Clarke (1998) found it in all open habitats, plantations and forest edges, and the valley o f the Rio Papagaio. Its total present estimated distribution and status is common in open and edge habitat below 250 m, with the exception o f the south-west where it is rare.White-bellied kingfisher A lcedo  naisEndemic species to Principe.TaxonomyFry and de Naurois (1984) treated it as a race o í Alcedo leucogaster. Similarly, Christy and Clark (1998) treat it as a subspecies, Alcedo leucogaster nais and Jones and Tye (2001) as Corythornis leucogaster nais. Here I follow Sibley and Monroe (1990), Peet and Atkinson (1994), and Stattersfield et al. (1998) and treat the Principe White-bellied kingfisher as a full species, Alcedo nais.Status and DistributionCommon along the coast and forested regions along rivers up to 250 m and frequent in the dense forested regions in the southern lowland forest. Frequent along rivers up to about 700 m, but absent from the dense rainforest (Table 6.1). Keulemans (1866) documented it as being found throughout the island and relatively common at lower elevations. Dohm (1866) stated that it was common on the shore, but that single specimens were also seen flying around the interior o f  the island. Snow (1950), Jones and Tye (1988), Atkinson et al. (1991), Sargeant (1994) all had similar observations to Dohm (1866) finding it common along watercourses, but also away from rivers including in plantations, gardens, and native forest (Jones and Tye 2001). Christy and145Chapter 6: Conservation status of the endemic birds of Principe________________________Clarke (1998) stated that it is spread throughout the island. Its total estimated distribution and status is common along the coast and lowland forest near rivers, and frequent in lowland forest and plantations away from river systems. It is rare in the mountain forest, and primarily restricted to waterways.Threatened Status: Lower Risk lc.B lue-breasted kingfisher Halcyon malimbicus dryasEndemic subspecies to Principe and the islet o f Boné do Joquei. Formerly recorded on Sao Tomé, although these records appear to be erroneous (de Naurois 1980; Jones and Tye 2001). The other subspecies is found on the African mainland.Status and DistributionVery common in all forested habitats throughout the southern lowland forest and up to 750 m. Keulemans (1866) and Dohm (1866) document it as most common in thick dense forest near rivers. Snow (1950) found it to be common in all plantations visited. Jones and Tye (1988) found it to be common in plantations and around Santo Antonio. Christy and Clarke (1998) noted it as found in most habitats. Its total estimated distribution and status is very common in all forest habitats throughout the island and up to 750 m.Threatened Status: Lower Risk lc.Principe drongo Dicrurus modestusEndemic species to Principe.TaxonomyThe Principe drongo is treated as a subspecies o f  D. adsimilis by Sibley and Monroe (1990). Here I follow Peet and Atkinson (1994), Christy and Clark (1998), Jones and Tye (2001) and treat the Principe drongo as an endemic species.Status and DistributionRare to frequent in the southern lowland forest up to 350 m and absent from the mountain forest (Table 6.1). Keulemans (1866) found it fairly common throughout the island including the forest and uninhabited areas. Snow (1950) found them most common on plantations. Jones and Tye (1988) and Atkinson et al. (1991) found it frequent to common in open habitat with scattered trees such as in the town o f Santo Antonio, in plantations and along roads. Christy and Clarke (1998) stated that they prefer open or low-density areas o f  the north and central regions, and that their distribution in the southern lowland forest and mountainous areas is not well known.146Chapter 6: Conservation status of the endemic birds of Principe_________________________This species may have experienced a significant decline in the early 1970s, probably due to pesticide use (de Naurois and Castro Antunes 1973; Jones and Tye 2001). The total estimated distribution and status is frequent to common in open or edge habitat, including Santo Antonio in the north o f the island, rare to frequent in the southern forest and absent from the mountain forest.Threatened Status: Vulnerable D2.Principe glossy starling Lamprotornis ornatusEndemic species to Principe.Status and DistributionVery common to abundant in the southern lowland forests and common to very common in the mountainous forest with a maximum recorded elevation o f 750 m (Table6.1). The closely related splendid glossy starling Lamprotornis splendidus from the mainland also inhabits the island, although it was not observed. Dohm (1866) and Keulemans (1866) document the Principe glossy starling as common in the higher parts o f the interior. Snow (1950), Jones and Tye (1988), Atkinson et al. (1991), and Christy and Clarke (1998) recorded it as abundant to very abundant in plantations and secondary forest, although Snow (1950) found it to be less common in the southern plantations. It was hunted in the past for food (Keulemans 1866) and children continue to capture and sell them (pers. obs.). The total estimated distribution, and abundance is very common to abundant in lowland forests and plantations and common to very common in the mountainous forest.Threatened Status: Lower Risk lc.G ulf of G uinea thrush Turdus olivaceofus xanthorhynchusEndemic subspecies to Principe, the other subspecies is on Sáo Tomé.TaxonomyWith different morphology, behaviour, song and habitat requirements, it is probable that the Principe subspecies is a separate species altogether. As noted by Amadon (1953) the bill is much more yellow than the Sáo Tomé subspecies Turdus olivaceofus olivaceofus, the tarsi tends to be more yellow, ventral markings are more blackish and the entire body is smaller (Figure 6.2). It also appears to be more restricted in its distribution than its relative on Sáo Tomé. The Sao Tomé subspecies has been documented as common in all forest types including plantations and found at highest densities in the lowland primary forest and lowland shade forest (Atkinson et al. 1991).147Chapter 6: Conservation status of the endemic birds of Príncipe_____________________The Príncipe subspecies is also much tamer allowing approach within a few meters. Finally the song of the two subspecies is distinct (Sasha d’Assis Lima in litt. to Peter Jones, 1998; Pers. obs.).Figure 6.2 Gulf of Guinea thrush T u rdu s o liv a c e o fu s  x a n th o rh yn ch u s  Status arid DistributionRare in the southern lowland forest. However, it appears to be relatively common at lower elevations in the region of A Mesa. Frequent to common above 250 m in the late successional and primary forests with highest observed numbers between 500 to 700 m on Pico do Principe and Pico Meneóme. Maximum observed elevation of 800 m (Table 6.1). This accounts for the species' entire distribution. Principe thrush was discovered in 1901 by Fea (Salvadori 1901), who noted that it was not common and appeared to be restricted to the western coast of the island (Bannerman 1914). In 1909 Boyd Alexander searched for the thrush, but it was never observed. Correia collected four specimens (Amadon 1953) in the hill forest of the south (Jones and Tye 2001) and stated that they were found only on the highest peaks (Correia 1929). De Naurois (1984), like Boyd Alexander, searched for it to no avail. In 1996 possible thrush anvils were discovered in the primary forest along Rio Papagaio and a month later at Oque Pipi (Christy and Gascoigne 1996). Shortly after the thrush was observed twice on A Mesa (see Jones and Tye 2001). Thus, until this study the thrush had only been observed three times since the time of its discovery. The total estimated distribution and status is rare in the lower elevation primary and late successional secondary forest starting from Pico Papagaio south to the southern lowland forest with the exception of A Mesa where it is common. Frequent to common in the mountain forest.148Chapter 6: Conservation status of the endemic birds of Principe________________________Threatened Status: Vulnerable DD ohrn’s thrush-babbler H orizorhinus dohrniEndemic species to Principe.Status and DistributionAbundant in the southern lowland and mountain forest up to 945 m (Table 6.1). Keulemans (1866) made similar observations in 1865. Snow (1950) documented Dohm’s thrush-babbler as second only to the Principe weaver in abundance. Later expeditions have documented it as abundant in cocoa plantations and forest regrowth (Jones and Tye 1988; Atkinson et al. 1991). The total estimated distribution and status is abundant in all forest habitats on the island and very common in brush habitat, plantations, and gardens. It is undoubtedly the most common species when the entire island is considered.T hreatened S ta tus: Lower Risk lc.Principe sunbird  N ectarin ia  hartlaubiEndemic species to Principe.Status and DistributionVery common in the southern lowland forest and mountain forest up to the summit of Pico do Principe (Table 6.1). This corresponds with the observations o f Keulemans (1866). Dohm (1866) described it as not uncommon. Snow (1950) found it in most habitats explored, but did not observe it in the hill forest. Atkinson et al. (1991) found it common to abundant in plantations, primary and secondary forest and present but less common in gardens and cultivated areas. The total estimated distribution and status is very common in the plantations and forested areas from sea level to 945 m and common in gardens and heavily cultivated regions in the north.Threatened sta tus: Lower Risk lc.Principe white-eye Z osterops ficedu lin u s ficedu lin u s.Endemic subspecies to Principe. The other subspecies is endemic to S&o Tomé.Status and DistributionGroups o f this subspecies were only observed on one day o f the study near Infante D. Henrique at mid altitude in the south-east o f the island (figure 6.1). Local people claimed that it is more common at lower elevations in October and November. These observations are at odds with earlier reports o f them being fairly common in the higher149Chapter 6: Conservation status of the endemic birds of Principe________________________parts (Keulemans 1866; Dohm 1866; Bannerman 1914). Dohm (1866) also stated that they did not occur much in the lower section o f the island. Correia (1929) was only able to collect two specimens o f this subspecies (Amadon 1953) indicating that it was relatively rare. It was not observed by Snow (1950) or Frade (1958). De Naurois (1983) observed one white-eye in the south-west forest in the early 1970s and noted that they had been rare for most o f the century. It was not seen by any o f the ICBP expeditions. Christy and Clarke (1998) stated that it is not common and lives in the central mountainous region and on the margins o f that area. The total estimated distribution and status is extremely rare in the southern forest along forest edge at mid- to low altitude with a maximum elevation o f 350 m. It is also possibly seasonally present in the north.Threatened Status: Critically endangered B1 + 2ePrincipe speirops Speirops leucophaeusEndemic species to Príncipe.Status and DistributionFrequent to common in the south-west and mountain forest up to 800 m (Table 6.1).The abundance o f this species is difficult to estimate because it tends to travel in groups o f up to 30 individuals and while it is found throughout the island, its distribution appears to be relatively localised leading to sporadic observations o f many individuals. Dohm (1866) stated that they live in small flocks in restricted regions, however, Keulemans (1866) during the same time period found it very common throughout the island. Correia in 1928 collected many specimens (Amadon 1953). De Naurois (1983) described this species as abundant at all altitudes. Snow (1950) like Dohm documented it as rather local. Jones and Tye (1988) found it frequent in small parties in plantations. Peter Jones and John Burlison observed them as quite common in noisy groups with Dohm’s thrush-babblers between Sao Joaquim and Maria Correia (pers. comm. Peter Jones). Jones and Tye (1988) state they are occasionally eaten for food and are vulnerable to pesticide use. The total estimate o f its distribution and status is frequent to locally common in plantations, secondary and primary forest including the mountain region.Threatened Status: Vulnerable D2.150Chapter 6: Conservation status of the endemic birds of Principe________________________Principe seedeater P oliospiza  rufobrunnea rufobrunneaEndemic subspecies to Principe. One o f the other subspecies is endemic to SSo Tomé and the other to Boné do Joquei.Status and DistributionAbundant in the south o f the island from sea level to 945 m and common on the east and west coast. It is the second most common bird in the southern lowland forest and the third most common in the mountain forest (Table 6.1). It was documented as common by most o f the early collectors and ornithologists, for example Keulemans (1866), Correia (1929) and Snow (1950). However, Dohm (1866) documented it as a rare bird, restricted to the Bahia do Oeste, where it lived in bushy uncultivated areas. De Naurois (1975) found the seedeater common in 1970 but uncommon in 1972-1973. Jones and Tye (1988) only saw two seedeaters in the north over five days and Atkinson et al. (1991) did not observe the subspecies during their four-day stay in the north. Christy and Clarke (1998) documented it as occurring throughout the island but relatively rare in the north and cultivated areas. The total estimated distribution and status o f the Principe subspecies is abundant in the southern and mountain regions, and common on the east and west coast, but only rare in the north.Threatened S ta tus: Near Threatened.Principe golden weaver P loceus prin cepsEndemic species to Principe and the islet o f  Boné do Joquei.Status and DistributionCommon along the coast up to 200 m in the southern lowland forest, frequent from 200 m to 600 m. In the mountain forest it was not observed above 600 m. Keulemans (1866) believed it to be the most numerous bird on the island. Snow (1950) also found them abundant, but did not observe them in the hill forest. All recent records continue to document this species as abundant (Jones and Tye 1988; Atkinson et al 1991; Christy and Clarke 1998). Its total estimated distribution and status is abundant throughout the north with highest densities in plantations, the edge o f secondary forest and along the coast. It is abundant along the east and west coast, but only common along the coast o f the southern lowland forest. In the south it is frequent at mid- to low altitude forest and absent from the high mountain forest.Threatened S tatus: Lower Risk lc.151Discussion Threatened statusThis study indicates that only two of the seven endemic birds at the species level qualify for the IUCN threat categories. These are Principe speirops and Principe drongo, both o f which are listed only on the basis o f their restricted range (Vulnerable D2). The University o f East Anglia group (Atkinson et al 1991) noted that, based on Keulemans' comments on the drongo’s distribution, it may be common in the primary forest. However, given the few sightings in the south-west and the absence o f the drongo in high mountain forest it is clear that this species has a lower overall density than was previously estimated. Its total population is difficult to estimate as it is at its highest abundance in the northern section o f the island where point counts were not conducted. Keulemans' comments are sufficiently general that it is reasonable to assume that they were never common in the mountain forest. Thus, a decline cannot be inferred. It is clear that the drongo has a total range o f less than 100 km2, which would qualify the species as Vulnerable D2. Estimates o f absolute density in the north should be carried out in the near future.Principe speirops was recently down-listed from Vulnerable C2b to near threatened by BirdLife International (BirdLife International 2001). However, this down-listing appears slightly premature if  the IUCN Categories and Criteria (1994) are strictly applied. If  we assume its average abundance in the southern lowland forest is indicative o f its overall abundance for the island (Table 6.1), there would be c. 2,000 individuals. With a continuing decline this species could qualify for Critically Endangered based on its small range, or Endangered based on its small population. However, given the range o f estimates o f its status over the years, it is not clear that the speirops has in fact been in decline. It is clear that the population tends to be localised and most probably has a total distribution o f less than 100 km2. Principe speirops should therefore be listed as Vulnerable based on its very small range regardless o f  decline. The IUCN category and criterion would be Vulnerable D2 (IUCN 1994).The status o f the eight endemic subspecies is less secure with two qualifying for Critically Endangered, one for Vulnerable, and two for Near Threatened. Exploration o f the mountain and southern forest indicate that Principe white-eye is at serious risk of extinction. Based on Dohm’s notes (1866) hope remained that Principe white-eye was abundant in the mountain forest. With no observations in the mountain forest during thisChapter 6: Conservation status of the endemic birds of Principe__________________________152Chapter 6: Conservation status of the endemic birds of Principe________________________study, despite sixteen days of surveying, it is probable that the species has experienced a decline. With such a small distribution and decline in the number o f  individuals, Principe white-eye qualifies for Critically Endangered Bl+2e.The Principe subspecies o f the Gulf o f Guinea thrush is still considered extremely rare, but its relatively common presence in the primary forest is encouraging. Principe thrush has an extremely restricted range and total population figures are certainly below 1,000 individuals. Therefore, the thrush qualifies for the Vulnerable D category based on population figures alone. Given the observations and collections o f Fea (Salvadori 1901), Boyd Alexander in 1909 (Bannerman 1914), Correia (1929) and de Naurois (1983), it would appear that this species has always been rare and restricted to its present habitat type. However, further research is required to determine whether the population is in decline.Principe seedeater on Principe, has c. 11,000 individuals in the southern 45 km2 o f the island. This species is not as threatened as previously suspected. However, due to its sparse population in sections o f its range and apparent fluctuations in population, it should be considered as Near Threatened. The reason for the low abundance o f this subspecies in the north o f the island is unknown and deserves further attention as its counterparts Poliospiza rufobrunnea thomensis on S&o Tomé (de Naurois 1983; Atkinson eta. 1991; Christy and Clarke 1998) and Poliospiza rufobrunnea frade on Boné de Joquei (Chapter 7) are abundant in most forest types and at all elevations.Green pigeon was recorded as very common throughout the island by the early collectors (Dohm 1866; Keulemans 1866). It is now rare to absent in the late successional and primary forest in the southern section o f the island. While it still remains relatively common around cocoa plantations and edge habitat, this species should qualify for Near Threatened as it may have undergone a significant population reduction and it appears to have an extremely low abundance throughout much of its range.Olive ibis was not observed in the explored regions, which is o f  great concern, as these are the locations where the Ibis was historically reported to have existed. I f  olive ibis still persists, then it would undoubtedly qualify for Critically Endangered D based on the small number o f mature individuals.153Chapter 6: Conservation status of the endemic birds of PrincipeThe suspected owl species, that has been heard but never seen, was not heard nor seen.If this species is more than a myth, and if it is endemic, it would very probably qualify for Critically Endangered D, based on a very small number o f mature individuals.Finally, African grey parrot is o f conservation concern as it is known that this species is harvested for the pet trade. An average parrot hunter will collect about 40 young per year and sell each one for about 50,000 Dobras per bird (approximately US$ 6.50 at current exchange rates). Juste (1996) estimates that 1,500 young are harvested each year plus an unknown number o f adults. De Melo (1998) estimates an annual harvest of between 430-550 chicks and 200-300+ adults. The overall effects o f  this on the population dynamics are unknown. Using the mean abundance per kilometre squared there are c. 4,500 African grey parrots in the 25 km2 o f the southern lowlands o f Principe. This is the region where the parrots are most abundant, and it is therefore unlikely that the total island population exceeds 20,000. Given population figures alone this potentially geographically isolated population would not be considered threatened. However, given its exploitation and the uncertain age structure o f the population, the African grey parrot on Principe would be listed as Near Threatened. The population trends require further investigation. If  a decline could be inferred due to exploitation, this population would soon qualify for Endangered Bl+2e.The dominance o f endemicsIf the process o f the taxon cycle (Ricklefs and Cox 1972,1978; Grant and Grant 1998) was occurring, one would expect the endemic bird species restricted to Principe to be the most vulnerable to extinction. However, the endemic birds remain the most common species on the island (Snow 1950), and when the status and distribution o f the endemic species and subspecies are compared, it is clear that the endemic subspecies are at greater risk o f extinction. Furthermore the only extinctions or extirpations on Principe have been non-endemics (Amadon 1953). Here it would appear that the taxon cycle is working in reverse. With the exception o f African grey parrot and olive sunbird, only species or subspecies restricted to Principe were common in the primary and late secondary forest habitat. A similar relationship has been demonstrated on Sáo Tomé (Peet and Atkinson 1994). There are three main reasons why mainland forest birds may not have been able to become established on the island: (1) tropical rainforest birds are much less likely to migrate to an oceanic island (MacArthur et al. 1972) and154Chapter 6: Conservation status of the endemic birds of Principe__________________________therefore, new arrivals are extremely rare; (2) Principe may be too small for many mainland forest species to persist; (3) the island endemics may out compete new arrivals for limited resources, as has been suggested on Sao Tomé (Peet and Atkinson 1994). Distance and area may be factors in limiting the number o f  new arrivals. However, Principe is relatively close to continental Africa (220 km) and tropical rainforest habitat is found in large sections o f the Gulf o f Guinea mainland. There has also been 500 years o f European colonisation during which forest birds could have been introduced to the island. While area may be a restriction for some species a great variety o f forest birds have colonised small islands throughout the world (see Stattersfield et al. 1998).In the case o f Principe, distance and area on their own appear inadequate to explain the lack o f non-endemics in the dense rainforest. Thus, it is possible that competitive exclusion (Lack 1969) plays a role on islands such as Principe where there have been few extinctions and high abundance levels o f the native avifauna have been maintained despite the introduction o f mammalian predators.Low levels o f threatIslands that were uninhabited until the arrival o f European colonists have a higher proportion o f threatened species and historic extinctions (Pimm et al. 1994; Chapter 3), e.g. Mauritius, the Seychelles and Reunion. It is therefore surprising that Principe has only two endemic species that might be considered vulnerable to extinction and that there have been no documented endemic bird historic extinctions. It is possible that there have been undocumented extinctions. However the island has an extremely high number o f endemic species and subspecies given its small size (Jones 1994), which indicates that recent extinctions have not been extensive. Although, the absence o f ground dwelling forest birds or large flightless species indicates that a few undocumented extinctions may have occurred.Principe has had a unique land use history, which may be responsible for the low levels o f present threat. Despite clearance o f much o f the native forest during the colonial era, shade trees remained for the dominant crops (cocoa and coffee) maintaining a general forest structure. All the endemic species and subspecies appear to have been able to persist in this modified habitat with the exception o f G ulf o f Guinea thrush and possibly olive ibis. The mountainous region in the centre o f the island and, with the exception o f roughly a 50 year period, most o f  the south-west remain a substantial refuge for the155Chapter 6: Conservation status of the endemic birds of Principe________________________island endemic species and subspecies. Unlike most other islands there is now more forest habitat on Principe than there has been for the past century.The inaccessible mountain rainforest would have been a refuge from exploitation during the colonial era and subsequent regeneration throughout the south has greatly decreased the accessibility o f  the entire region. With the exception o f African grey parrot, exploitation is at a very small scale and restricted to easily accessible areas around Santo Antonio and plantations in the north.The mountain refuge and subsequent regeneration in the south may also play a role in the low levels o f threat observed due to introduced predators. At the species level none o f the endemic birds appear to be threatened due to introduced predators. However, the cause o f rarity o f the subspecies olive ibis, Gulf o f Guinea thrush, Principe white-eye and Principe seedeater (in the north o f its range) are unknown and may be associated with introductions. The mona monkey was common throughout the primary and late succession secondary forest, rats and mice were rare and no other introduced mammals were observed. While proper trapping is needed to estimate the diversity and density of introduced predators, it appears that many o f the human commensual mammalian predators such as cats or feral dogs are at low abundance or absent in the thick tropical rainforest. This dense habitat also provides protection from nest predation. Perhaps this is why rainforest species appear to be less vulnerable in island systems (Paulay 1994).Finally, Principe is relatively close to the mainland (220 km), and Chapter 3 has demonstrated that endemic birds closer to the mainland are less vulnerable to extinction. Endemic species that are closer to the mainland may be less threatened for a number o f reasons. The avifauna, as well as other flora and fauna tends to be more specious on islands closer to the mainland (MacArther and Wilson 1967). This would broaden a species evolutionary experience to predators and competitors as well as disease. Islands closer to the mainland are also more likely to be exposed to migrants, strays, or potential colonists. Again this would increase their evolutionary experience to competitors, predators and disease.Exposure to a broader range o f predators or diseases would inhibit the evolution of, or filter out, life-history traits or an immune system that may make a species more vulnerable to extinction once exposed to mainland species. While historic vectors o f156Chapter 6: Conservation status of the endemic birds of Principe________________________disease are difficult to identify it is possible to highlight a few o f the native predators. Land-crabs have been suggested as a surrogate for mammalian predators (Atkinson 1985). There are a variety o f land-crabs found on Principe, one o f which is present even at the highest point o f the island (Cumberlidge et al. submitted). There are also two species o f snake present on Principe, although their date o f colonisation is unknown. In addition, there are avian predators such as the black kite Milvus migrans and blue­breasted kingfisher.It is less clear as to why island endemics should be particularly susceptible to competition from mainland species (Pregili & Olson 1981). Especially when it is considered that island endemics may be well adapted to restricted-range environments (Blondel 1991). First, it is possible that they are not less competitive in their native environment, but alteration o f their habitat by humans has resulted in island endemics being less competitive than introduced species well adapted to a disturbed landscape. Second, island birds may be isolated from novel competitive adaptations on the mainland. Thus, they are simply exposed to mainland competitive processes at a later stage, making them appear as though they have become less competitive. This process would have the greatest effect on communities that have been isolated for the greatest period o f time. Third, birds on distant species poor islands may be more likely to evolve into a new ecological zone or niche. These species may be particularly vulnerable to the introduction o f mainland species that traditionally occupy the niche space in to which the island endemics have evolved.Future threatsCurrent habitat destruction on the island is minimal and there are encouraging plans to designate the remaining primary forest in south-west and central Principe as a National Park. Legislation for establishing a national protected area system has been passed but no specific protected areas have yet been gazetted. The protection o f this region is essential for the long-term persistence o f the endemic birds. Species particularly dependent on this region are Gulf o f  Guinea thrush, Principe seedeater, Principe speirops, and possibly the Principe white-eye and olive ibis.Recent plans to develop over a third o f the island as a free trade zone, promoted as Africa’s Hong Kong, have now fortunately been abandoned. The current government remains interested in free zone development but is adopting a more cautious approach.157Chapter 6: Conservation status of the endemic birds of Principe_______________________If the recent proposal for a free trade zone had proceeded, then businesses such as multinational oil companies, financial services firms and trading companies would have been encouraged to base their headquarters on a 50 km2 concession (WADCO 1999). The concession area accounted for 36% of the island's area and would have caused a significant reduction in the already restricted ranges o f the island's endemic species and subspecies. Now the government is focusing on oil exploration and the future rapid development o f this sector is the single greatest threat to the birds o f  Principe.Since 1988 the government has gradually been privatising agricultural land to encourage self-sufficiency in food production. After many difficulties, the privatisation programme finally became effective in the late 1990s. However, the privatisation o f agricultural land is having important consequences on the environment. Small farmers often cut down the trees on their land immediately on receiving title in order to raise sufficient capital to develop the land further. Low world cocoa prices have also lead to agricultural practices where shade trees are not necessary. In addition, pesticides are now more accessible and commonly used on the island. This process o f privatisation will undoubtedly reduce suitable bird habitat outside o f  the southern forest block.ConclusionWith bird surveys o f the mountain forest and the southern lowland forest, it is now possible to make more robust assessments o f the conservation status o f the island’s endemic species and subspecies on Principe. Based on this research I classify two of the seven Principe endemic species as Vulnerable to extinction due to their restricted range, Principe speirops and Principe drongo. The status o f the endemic subspecies is less encouraging. Three o f  the eight subspecies qualify as threatened with extinction (Gulf o f Guinea thrush, Principe white-eye and olive ibis), and a further two are Near Threatened (the Principe seedeater and the green pigeon). Given present population figures in the regions surveyed, the African grey parrot does not appear to be threatened with extinction but has been listed as Near Threatened due to the uncertain age structure o f the population. The legendary owl was not seen during this study and its validity remains a mystery.When Principe is considered in the context o f  other oceanic islands that have been discovered in historic times, the levels o f threat and extinction are low. The resilience o f the endemic birds appears to be associated with the rainforest habitat and the158relatively close proximity o f the island to the mainland. However, the central mountainous region and southern section o f the island, which have been uninhabited for much o f the island's history, have undoubtedly played a strong role in the persistence of these small range island endemics. The future o f the endemic birds o f Principe remains positive as long as large-scale development projects are not encouraged and the government maintains its commitment to conserving the central and southern sections o f the island.Chapter 6: Conservation status of the endemic birds of Principe_________________________159ReferencesAmadon, D. 1953.

Its closest relative is Serinus rufobrunneus rufobrunneus found on the larger island of Principe (139 km2) only 3 km away from Bone de Joquei. S rufobrunneus fradei is unusual, firstly because it has evolved into a distinct form within close proximity to its conspecific, and secondly because it has been able to persist when restricted to a global distribution o f less than 1 km2. Little is known about S rufobrunneus fradei, as research has not been conducted on this subspecies since it was described 25 years ago. In this paper, I confirm that S rufobrunneus fradei is a distinct evolutionary unit that can easily be distinguished from its conspecifics. I present research on its distribution, abundance and ecology. I compare the Bone de Joquei population to its conspecific on Principe and demonstrate that it is found in a broader range o f habitats and at a super abundant population density. I suggest that the process o f density compensation may be essential for the long-term persistence o f many endemic birds restricted to extremely small isolated islands. To effectively conserve these populations it is essential to understand the specific mechanisms associated with super abundance such as lack o f avian competition, mammalian predation, and an abundant food supply, so that the conditions associated with super abundance may be maintained.Chapter 7: Super abundance and persistence: lessons from a small oceanic island____________165IntroductionThe Principe Seedeater Serinus rufobrunneus is divided into three subspecies found on different small oceanic islands in the Gulf o f Guinea. The Principe subspecies Serinus rufobrunneus rufobrunneus was the first to be described by Gray in 1862, followed by the Sao Tomé subspecies Serinus rufobrunneus thomensis described by Bocage in 1888 from the collection o f Francisco Newton (Jones and Tye 2001). Almost a century passed before de Naurois (1975) described the third subspecies Serinus rufobrunneus fradei found on Boné de Joquei, a small island o f 35 ha located 3 km off the southeast coast o f Principe (Figure 7.1). Although sporadic and infrequent, research over the past decade has provided a general understanding o f the status, distribution and ecology of Principe and SSo Tomé subspecies (Naurois, 1975; Jones and Tye 1988; Atkinson et al. 1991; Christy and Clark 1998; Jones and Tye 2001; Chapter 6). Much less is known about the Boné de Joquei population, as research has not been carried out on this subspecies since it was described by de Naurois (1975).Two unique aspects o f the Boné de Joquei seedeater population make it especially interesting from a conservation and evolutionary perspective. First, given that Principe is only 3 km from Boné de Joquei, it is remarkable that the interchange between the two populations has been low enough that they can easily be distinguished from one another. Three kilometres appears to be a relatively short distance when considering that the ancestor o f S. rufobrunneus would have had to have travelled at least 200 km over water to become established, and a further 150 km between Principe and Sáo Tomé.Secondly, it is well known that restricted-range species are particularly prone to extinction (Hanski 1982; Simberloff and Gotelli 1984; Gaston and Blackburn 1996; Simberloff 1998; Gaston and Chown 1999). Under the IUCN Categories and Criteria (IUCN 1994), a species is considered Vulnerable D2 if  it has a range o f less then 100 km . The Boné de Joquei population has been able to maintain a viable populationAwithin a range o f less than 1 km , o f  which a large proportion was used for agriculture prior to independence in 1975.Understanding the mechanisms that enable the Boné de Joquei population to persist within such a small distribution will aid in its effective conservation by enabling conservationists to ensure that these conditions are maintained in the future. A greater theoretical understanding o f small range persistence will also help to evaluate extinction risk o f the large number o f species that are presently confined to a small globalChapter 7: Super abundance and persistence: lessons from a small oceanic island____________166Chapter 7: Super abundance and persistence: lessons from a small oceanic island___________distribution. In addition, further research o f this subspecies and its conspecifics provides an excellent opportunity to explore questions such as rates o f ecological, evolutionary and behavioural divergence on islands.This paper is based on research that was carried out in the Democratic Republic o f Sáo Tomé and Príncipe between August 22nd and October 11th 1999, o f which two days were spent on the island o f Boné de Joquei. The validity o f the Boné de Joquei population as a distinct evolutionary unit is first discussed based on descriptive notes o f coloration and markings, the first photo o f a live specimen (Figure 7.2), the first recording o f its song (Figure 7.3) and basic morphological measurements. I present results o f research conducted on Boné de Joquei on the distribution, abundance and ecology o f its seedeater population. This subspecies is then compared with its conspecifics on Sáo Tomé and Principe and characteristics and conditions for persistence within a restricted range are discussed, in addition to possible conservation strategies.Study site and backgroundGeographyThe three islands where the subspecies o f  seedeater are found vary considerably in size, elevation and distance from the West African mainland. Seto Tomé is 225 km from the mainland with an area o f 836 km2 and just over 2000 m in elevation. Principe is 220 km from the mainland with an area o f  128 km2 (Juste and Fa 1994) and an elevation o f 945 m. Principe and Sáo Tomé are separated by 150 km and a sea depth o f more than 1800 m (Exell 1944; Amadon 1953). Boné de Joquei is only 3 km from the southeast tip of Principe and has an area o f 35 ha and a height o f 300 m (de Naurois 1975). The islands o f Sáo Tomé and Príncipe have never been attached; however, Boné de Joquei was likely part o f  the island o f Principe when water levels were much lower c l2,000 years ago (see Juste and Ibanez 1994) because the sea between the two islands is only 50 m deep (de Naurois 1975).AvifaunaAs can be expected by its relative size, Sáo Tomé has the highest number o f bird species with 50 (Jones and Tye 2001) land birds and, depending on the taxonomy followed,15 to 16 single island endemics, followed by Principe with 33 landbirds and, again depending on the taxonomy, 5 to 7 single island endemics. De Naurois (1975) records167three land birds on Boné de Joquei. He observed 3-4 blue-breasted kingfishers Halcyon malimbicus dryas, one couple o f  Principe golden weavers Ploceus princeps, and the Boné de Joquei subspecies o f seedeater. He states that the Boné de Joquei seedeater was nearly the only terrestrial bird on the island. He also documented two seabirds including the red-billed tropicbird Phaeton aethereus and the brown booby Sula leucogaster.Land use historyAll three islands have experienced significant habitat modification since their discovery in the late 1400s. On Sáo Tomé and Príncipe the profitable production o f sugar cane and, later, cocoa resulted in the cultivation o f large sections o f the islands (Atkinson et al. 1991). However, over the past decade, lack o f labour, disease, a crash in the cocoa industry and political instability have lead to the abandonment o f most o f the cultivated regions, which have now reverted to tropical rainforest. The history o f cultivation on Boné de Joquei is less well known. From the observations o f this study and o f de Naurois (1975), it is clear that virtually all o f  the accessible growing areas were planted with oil-palm Elaeis guineensis and coconut. This represents about 40% of the islands surface area. The local Catholic Priest on Principe claims that a man lived on Boné de Joquei prior to independence and that the island was particularly good for crops such as bananas, since the mona monkey Cercopithecus mona had not been introduced to Boné de Joquei. However, the steep vertical rock faces are unsuitable for cultivation (Figure7.1) and if  de Naurois (1975) was correct that no one had ever climbed to the top of Boné de Joquei, the dense brush on the summit would have escaped cultivation. The introduction o f mammalian predators such as the ship rat Rattus ratus, Norway rat Rattus norvegicus, house mouse Mus musculus, domestic cat, dog, mona monkey Cercopithecus mona (Dutton 1994) and civet Civettictis civetta (Bruto da Costa et al. 1916) have been documented on Sáo Tomé and or Principe, but none o f the above have been observed on Boné de Joquei.Chapter 7: Super abundance and persistence: lessons from a small oceanic island____________168Chapter 7: Super abundance and persistence: lessons from a small oceanic js landFigure 7.1. The island of Boné de JoqueiBackground to the seedeaterSubspecific statusBoth the small size of Boné de Joquei and the close proximity of its endemic subspecies of seedeater to its conspecific on Principe make it difficult to believe that the population on Boné de Joquei could evolve into a distinct evolutionary unit that can easily be distinguished from the other two subspecies. The validity of this subspecific classification has not been confirmed since S. rufobrunneus fradei was described by de Naurois over 25 years ago. Thus, it is reasonable that the subspecific status requires verification (Jones and Tye 2001). In this Chapter 1 do not wish to enter the debate about species concepts (e.g. Zink and McKitrickl995; Kelt and Brown 2000) or how distinct a population must be before it becomes deemed a subspecies. 1 simply hope to demonstrate whether or not the Boné de Joquei population is a unique evolutionary unit, defined as a taxon that can be consistently distinguished from its closest relative in morphology or colour. Differences in behaviour or ecology may also provide insight into variation between populations, but it is often difficult to determine whether they are genetically based. De Naurois (1975) describes the unique characteristics o f the Boné de Joquei population as having a brighter tint of red, particularly in the rump, throat and abdomen, with faint stripes on the back and no stripes on the abdomen. He states they are slightly heavier, with longer tails and longer, higher, more yellowish beaks than their closest relative, the Principe subspecies. The wing length of the Boné de Joquei population is longer than the Principe subspecies, but very similar to the Sao Tomé subspecies (de Naurois 1975).169Distribution and abundanceEarly documentation o f the status and distribution o f the Sao Tomé subspecies were greatly varied, ranging from uncommon to very common (Salvadori 1903a; Bannerman 1915; Correia 1929; De Naurois 1975). Subsequent to the observations o f de Naurois, the Sáo Tomé subspecies has been documented as common to abundant in all forest types (de Naurois, 1983; Jones and Tye, 1988; Atkinson et al., 1991; Christy and Clark, 1998; Jones and Tye, 2001) from sea level to the high mountains, but less common in the northern section o f the island (Jones and Tye, 1988). It has also been reported as common around urban areas (Jones and Tye, 1988; Chapter 6).Until very recently estimates o f the status and distribution o f the Principe subspecies has also been extremely inconsistent ranging from rare to very common (Dohm 1866; Keulemans 1866; Salvadori 1903b; Bannerman 1914; Correia 1929; Snow 1950; De Naurois 1975; Jones and Tye 1988; Atkinson et al. 1991). Christy and Clarke (1998) state that it was observed throughout the island, but is relatively rare in the north and in cultivated areas. This was confirmed in Chapter 6 where the Principe population is reported to be rare in the north and almost never seen near inhabited areas, the second most common bird in the southern lowland forest, and the third most common bird in the mountain forest.In the early 1970s de Naurois recorded the Boné de Joquei population o f seedeater as abundant (de Naurois, 1975), with a density estimate o f  30 to 40 per ha, suggesting a total o f 150-200 individuals in the oil-palm Elaeis guineensis forest. He states that it is probable that these birds inhabit more than the gradual slopes o f  the north face o f the island, and that they may also inhabit the forest o f the steep incline and the plateau on the summit o f  the island.MethodsOn September 8th 1999 Boné de Joquei was surveyed for forest bird species, documenting presence or absence, distribution, relative abundance and general notes on ecology. The entire island was covered, including the summit o f  300 m. General abundance was based on a system used by Jones and Tye (1988) and the University o f East Anglia group (Atkinson et al. 1991). Notes were taken on the markings and coloration o f the Boné de Joquei population o f seedeater in the wild. Photographs were taken with a 300 mm lens and the song was recorded using a microphone and recordingChapter 7: Super abundance and persistence: lessons from a small oceanic island____________170Chapter 7: Super abundance and persistence: lessons from a small oceanic islandsystem borrowed from the British Library National Sounds Archive, Wildlife Sounds Department. These songs were then compared with earlier recordings conducted by Alexander-Marrack in August 1980 on Sáo Tomé and Ian Sinclair on Principe in August 1991. Measurements were taken o f four unsexed individuals to determine bill length, width and depth, as well as wing, tarsus and tail length. These were later compared with specimens o f the Principe and Sáo Tomé subspecies at Tring, The Natural History Museum, England.The island was also explored to determine the best approach for the point count survey using distance sampling (see Buckland et al. 1993) that would take place on October 2 1999. Due to the topography o f the island, including a vertical rock face and large unsettled boulders throughout, stratified random sampling was not possible. Therefore two transects were walked around the island, one roughly between 10 and 70 meters from the shoreline and the other between 120 and 250 m. Each point count along the transect line was spaced by at least 100 m; however, ten o f the point counts were duplicated along the transect due to the small size o f  the island. Large distances were not required between transects as the sound o f the ocean quickly drowned out bird calls from one site to the next. In total 37 point counts were conducted whenever the light rains permitted between 5:30 AM and 5 PM. At each point count, two minutes were spent waiting for the birds to settle and recording data such as habitat, weather, temperature, elevation and time. The distances o f birds from a specific point were then estimated for five minutes. All species o f bird heard or seen were recorded. Throughout the survey the island was covered in cloud and temperatures ranged between 22° and 25 °C. Seventy four percent o f  the observations were based on sound. This data were analysed using Distance software 3.5 (Thomas et a l, 1998). Eight distance bands were applied using post stratification. The most distant band was set so that approximately 5% o f the most distant estimates would be removed from the analysis.ResultsThe Boné de Joquei seedeater population is reddish brown with a slightly more intense reddish tint on the breast and rump. The regions around the eye and chin are darker brown and faint darker lines can be detected running from the top o f the head to the171mantle. Below the chin the throat becomes slightly lighter reddish brown than both the breast and the chin. With the exception of the head region, the greater wing covers, the primary covers, the secondaries, the primaries and the tail feathers are a deeper brown than the rest of the body. The eye is a dark chestnut colour and the tarsus is a gray/pink (Figure 7.2).Chapter 7: Super abundance and persistence: lessons from a small oceanic island____________Figure 7.2.

The frequency modulation of three to nine kilohertz is relatively standard for the three subspecies and the song structure is similar. The trill rate appears to be similar between the Principe and Bond de Joquei populations, but is slightly slower for the Sao Tome subspecies (Figure 7.3).172Chapter 7: Super abundance and persistence: lessons from a small oceanic island___________Including the Bone de Joquei population o f seedeater, four forest birds were observed during this study, the blue-breasted kingfisher, Príncipe golden weaver and green pigeon Treron calva virescens. Two sea birds were also documented, the brown booby and the white-tailed tropiebird Phaethon lepturus. The Principe golden weavers were commonly seen or heard in groups o f two to five below 250 m altitude and were observed nesting on the island. Individual blue-breasted kingfishers were common throughout the island up to 300 m altitude. The green pigeon was seen high in the canopy at lower elevation, although it did not appear to be common. The brown booby was observed on large boulders along the coast and the white-tailed tropiebird was commonly observed in pairs on the ground above 200 m altitude or circling the summit o f Bone de Joquei once they had been disturbed. The white-tailed tropiebirds appeared to be nesting, however, the actual nest site was not confirmed due to the inaccessibility presented by loose boulders and large vertical drops.The Bone de Joquei population o f seedeater was found abundant in all habitat types on the island from sea level to 300 m, including oil-palm Elaeis guineensis forests, stands o f coconut, stands o f native trees, sparsely vegetated open areas caused by rock slides, and the dense shrub covering the summit o f  the island. However, it appeared much less abundant near the summit. It could be found at all levels in the vegetation including small branches close to the ground and perching on large boulders. It could easily be approached within four metres. The Bon6 de Joquei population o f seedeater was seen eating both oil-palm fruits and the flesh from coconut.Results from the point counts using distance sampling indicate that there were c l 85 Principe golden weavers, c9 blue-breasted kingfishers and c2000 seedeaters. The total estimate o f seedeaters is likely to be lower as transects were not run along the vertical rock face or the rocky elevated plateau near the summit where the seedeaters appear to be much less abundant. These areas account for almost half o f  the islands habitat, therefore assuming the seedeaters are at one fifth o f  their surveyed population density in these regions the total population would be c l200 individuals. The green pigeon was not observed during the point counts and an estimate is therefore not given (Table 7.2).173Chapter 7: Super abundance and persistence: lessons from a small oceanic islandTable 7.2.

Sao Tome Recordist: PeterSeedcatcr Alexander* M arrack— I—2 s175Chapter 7: Super abundance and persistence: lessons from a small oceanic island(c)DiscussionSubspecific statusObservations of the Boné de Joquei population’s markings and coloration are very similar to those of de Naurois (1975) and support the notion that the Boné de Joquei population is truly distinct from the other conspecifics. Both the Principe and Sao Tomé subspecies lack the reddish coloration, and have a lighter throat region than the Boné de Joquei population. The measurements from this study do not support de Naurois’ assertion that the Boné de Joquei population has a longer tail and wing as well as a higher, longer beak than S. rufobrunneus rufobrunneus (see Table 7.2). Measurements from this study should be treated with caution as the sample size is small; however, the remarkable similarity of all the measurements of the Boné de Joquei and the Principe subspecies suggests that there are no morphological differences.This study has demonstrated that the song frequency and structure are very similar between the different populations. Due to the extensive repertoire and variation in song, determination of the extent to which the specific songs have diverged and the variation176in repertoire size between the subspecies requires many more hours o f recording for all three subspecies.In the absence o f genetic studies it is difficult to know the extent to which the population has been isolated. Immigration might be expected given the close proximity o f Principe; but if  immigration were common the differences between the species would probably be smaller. However, if  there is strong selection for specific traits on an island the population may maintain differences despite periodic colonisation (Grant and Grant 1998). It is quite possible that they have evolved in complete isolation, as birds that have colonised distant islands often become poor dispersers (Diamond 1981; Grant 1998). Molecular studies could provide great insight into the extent o f isolation and the process o f divergence, whether it is a result o f selection, genetic drift (Wright 1940) or the founder effect (Mayr 1954; Berry 1998).Although there appears to be little difference in morphology between the Principe and Boné de Joquei population, the Bond de Joquei population can easily be distinguished from its conspecifics based on markings and coloration. There also appear to be ecological and behavioural differences that will be discussed later. In the absence of molecular tests the extent o f the genetic divergence remains unknown. However, it is clear that the Bond de Joquei population is a distinct identifiable evolutionary unit.Species presentDuring this study two birds are recorded that de Naurois (1975) did not document, the green pigeon and the white-tailed tropicbird. However, de Naurois documented the red­billed tropicbird that was not observed during this study. With the combined observations there are still only four forest birds and two sea birds that have been seen on the island. With the few sightings o f the green pigeon and an estimated population o f 8 individuals for the blue-breasted kingfisher, it is unlikely that they are isolated from the populations on Principe. The Principe golden weaver may be isolated to Boné de Joquei, but with a small estimated population o f 186 it is also likely that there is interchange with the Principe population.Distribution and behaviourThe distribution o f the Boné de Joquei seedeater population is similar to that o f the subspecies on Sáo Tomé and Príncipe in that it is found in a broad range o f forestChapter 7: Super abundance and persistence: lessons from a small oceanic island____________177Chapter 7: Super abundance and persistence: lessons from a small oceanic island_____________habitats (Christy and Clark 1998; Jones and Tye 2001). Different from both o f its conspecifics, the Boné de Joquei subspecies is commonly found exposed in sparsely vegetated open areas as well as occupying low, dense brush that covers much of the upper sections o f the island. Behaviourally, the Boné de Joquei population was much more tame than its conspecifics, allowing approach within four metres. It was observed commonly perching very close to the ground or on large boulders. Thus, the Boné de Joquei population appears to differ from its conspecifics both in its ecology and behaviour. However, it is not known if  these differences are genetically based.AbundanceThe Boné de Joquei population also differs in that it is found at much greater abundance throughout the island. Using the estimate o f 1200 for the total population o f the island the population density would be c34 individuals per hectare. This is an extremely high population density when considering that the Principe population’s highest abundance is 3.3 individuals per hectare (Chapter 6). Furthermore, the Principe subspecies is the second most abundant species in the south o f Principe and the third most abundant species in the mountain forest (Chapter 6). I f  the Boné de Joquei population had a similar abundance to that o f the Principe subspecies there would be c l 15 individuals on Boné de Joquei, a very small population to maintain a subspecies for thousands o f years.The estimate o f c34 species per hectare on Boné de Joquei requires a discussion o f potential biases that may lead to an inflated estimate simply because the abundance level is alarmingly high. Using point counts and distance sampling the observer is trying to identify the number o f individuals and their estimated distance during a snapshot in time. Highly mobile birds at high densities are more likely to fly into a survey site during the time when a point count is being conducted. I f  the species are not observed flying into the survey site they will be included in the point count and therefore the species will be over-represented. This problem is intensified when surveys are largely based on calls. In addition curious or island tame species may be more likely to be attracted to the observer. Although this may have resulted in a slight inflation o f the abundance estimate, it is indisputable that the Boné de Joquei population is found at extremely high levels o f abundance unparalleled on Principe.Keys to persistenceIsolated island environments may provide conditions that enable some species to live at178Chapter 7: Super abundance and persistence: lessons from a small oceanic island____________a level o f  super abundance and, therefore, greatly increase their probability o f long term persistence within a restricted range (Manne et al. 1999) by mitigating the negative effects associated with small populations confined to a very small area. Such negative effects are environmental stochasticity (Gilpin and Soulé 1986; Lande, 1993), demographic stochasticity (Richter-Dyn and Goel, 1972; Pimm et al. 1988), and inbreeding and loss o f selectable variation (Frankel and Soulé 1981; Soulé 1987). With a super abundant population the seedeaters on Boné de Joquei would be less susceptible to extinction due to periodic environmental influences such as storms (Spiller et al.1998). In turn, this would decrease the chance o f the population being reduced to a size that is susceptible to stochastic demographic extinction, bottle necks and inbreeding depression.Avian competitionThe low number o f forest birds (four) on Boné de Joquei may have allowed the Boné de Joquei population to broaden its niche and access a greater proportion o f the island’s resources, a process known as density compensation, competitive release or density inflation (MacArthur et al. 1972; Crowell 1983; Blondel 1991; Manne etal. 1999).This is supported by the broad range o f habitat types currently occupied by the Boné de Joquei subspecies. Most o f the Principe species would have once been represented on Boné de Joquei, as it was part o f the island o f Principe c l 2,000 years ago. Why most of the Principe species were unable to persist on Boné de Joquei is unknown. We can only guess as to whether it was a process o f  competitive exclusion (Lack 1969, 1976), lack o f appropriate habitat or resources, chance or a combination o f the above. Ironically, it is likely that many of the local extinctions resulted in an increase o f the seedeaters probability o f long term persistence, as the absence o f  competitors may have enabled it to access a broader range o f resources and sustain a higher population density.It is unknown whether the presence o f the abundant seedeater on Boné de Joquei restricts the successful colonisation and persistence o f  other species. However, it is interesting to note that the small birds from Principe that could be considered competitors, such as the Dohm’s thrush-babbler Horizorhinus dohmi or the Principe white-eye Zosterops ficedulinus, are not present, while the only other common forest birds on Boné de Joquei, the Principe golden weaver and the blue-breasted kingfisher, primarily focus on food resources outside o f the seedeater’s range, such as larger insects, snails and small birds (see Christy and Clark 1998).179Abundant food supplyOil-palm fruit and seeds (de Naurois 1975) appear to be the most common food sources o f the Boné de Joquei population; however, the other subspecies have been observed to forage on both fruits and insects (Christy and Clarke 1998). Such a generalist feeding strategy indicates that the seedeater may be able to access a much broader range o f resources in the absence o f competitors. Despite the negative or positive effects o f competition, there must be an abundant food resource available in order for the seedeater to sustain such a high population density. The island’s vegetative landscape prior to cultivation is unknown, but oil-palm is currently one o f the most dominant trees on the island and may now be essential for the maintenance o f their high population densities.Mammalian predationThe population density o f the seedeaters on Boné de Joquei may also be higher due to the lack o f mammalian predators. The only potential predator observed on Boné de Joquei was the blue-breasted kingfisher, which has been documented to have eaten small birds on Principe (Keulemans 1866; Correia 1928-9; Snow 1950). Sáo Tomé and Príncipe have a broad range o f introduced mammalian predators (Dutton 1994) and some o f these may be present on Boné de Joquei; however, there are a number o f  clues that indicate that destructive mammalian predators have not yet reached the island.First, the white-tailed tropicbird appeared to be nesting on the ground above 200 m altitude on Boné de Joquei. They were not observed nesting on Principe and on Sáo Tomé they are only found in the mountain interior, presumably where mammalian predation is lower. Secondly, there is a large reddish land crab found at extremely high levels o f  abundance throughout Boné de Joquei but not common on Principe. The distribution o f land crabs is often limited by mammalian predators (Hartnoll 1988). Finally, perching close to the ground and island tameness should be less common with the presence o f mammalian predators.ConservationHabitat destruction, the most common threat to island birds (Stattersfield 1998), does not appear to be an imminent threat on Boné de Joquei. Conservation attention should focus on factors associated with the extremely high abundance o f the Boné de Joquei seedeater population. I believe these factors are lack o f avian competitors, abundant food supply, and lack o f mammalian predators. However, further work is required toChapter 7: Super abundance and persistence: lessons from a small oceanic island____________180identify the dominant mechanism or mechanisms enabling super abundance. The island should be monitored on a periodic basis to assess if  any potential avian competitors have become established. It is important to determine whether mammalian predators have been introduced to the island. If extensive trapping indicates that they have not yet been established or that there are few mammalian species, efforts should be made to educate the local fishing community and tourist operators about the importance o f not transporting mammals to the island. Although the seedeaters have presumably survived on natural vegetation for thousands o f years, cultivation in the last century and the introduction o f non-agricultural exotics may have substantially changed the ecosystem dynamics. For example, succession o f a single aged stand o f oil-palm may lead to the sudden loss o f food supply. We need to leam more about this species’ feeding habits and requirements and monitor the island to ensure that there is an abundant food supply. A general conservation lesson can also be learned from the Boné de Joquei seedeater population. When conservationists are attempting to manage small isolated island populations that have already been disturbed they must consider that the population may have once existed at super abundant levels and such population densities may be essential for its future survival.ConclusionThis study has confirmed that the Boné de Joquei population o f seedeater is distinct from the Principe and S2o Tomé subspecies and has persisted on the small island of Boné de Joquei at least long enough to evolve different coloration and markings, and potentially unique ecological, and behavioural traits. I demonstrate that the Boné de Joquei population is found to be at least 10 times more abundant than its closest relative on Principe. The high level o f abundance appears to be driven by lack o f avian competition, abundant food resources, and absence or low species diversity o f mammalian predators. I suggest that conditions specific to a small isolated island have enabled the seedeater to sustain a super abundance and, therefore, reduce its extinction probability by mitigating the negative effects o f small populations, such as stochastic events and inbreeding depression. I recommend that conservation attention focus on the mechanisms driving super abundance to ensure that these conditions are maintained on Boné de Joquei. Conservation efforts should include monitoring the island for avian competitors or mammalian predators and ensuring that there is a continued abundant food supply. The study o f this extremely restricted-range subspecies has demonstrated that all restricted-range species are not equal. Specific conditions o f an isolated smallChapter 7: Super abundance and persistence: lessons from a small oceanic island_____________181Chapter 7: Super abundance and persistence: lessons from a small oceanic island__________island may allow a species to live at higher densities and persist for thousands of years within a range size that would not be possible under mainland or higher diversity conditions.182ReferencesAmadon, D. 1953.

I have addressed nine main questions in this thesis: Are there unique traits associated with island endemic birds? Have prehistoric human-caused extinctions influenced present patterns o f avian extinction risk? Has the process o f extinction changed from prehistoric times to the present? Have humans been responsible for the selective removal o f specific life history or ecological traits on islands? Are island or mainland birds with similar distributions at greater risk o f  extinction? Are the extinction processes on islands and the mainland the same? Which life history, ecological, or morphological traits are associated with species that are more vulnerable to extinction? What is the status and distribution o f the endemic birds o f  Principe and why has this community o f species been so resilient to extinction? What traits or conditions have enabled the Principe seedeater Serinus rufobrunnea fradei to persist on an islet o f less than 1km2 for thousands o f years? Here I summarise the main findings o f  the thesis, discuss the theoretical and practical conservation implications o f  the research, and outline interesting areas for future study.The results from Chapter 2 indicate that there are unique traits associated with island endemic birds and that many o f  these traits also vary within islands in relation to biogeographic features, such as a species’ total distribution and average latitude and distance from the mainland. The analyses indicate that clutch size decreases on islands, island birds are more sexually size dimorphic than their mainland relatives, small species tend to get larger on islands and there is a non-significant trend for large birds to get smaller. Within islands, clutch size decreases with a species total distribution and, for passerines, it increases with greater distance from the equator and decreases with distance from the mainland. It is also noteworthy that oceanic island endemic birds do not follow Bergmann’s rule, as they are not larger in body size at greater distance from the equator.Given that there are consistent differences between island and mainland species it is reasonable to assume that island endemic birds may respond in different ways to extrinsic threat processes. In some cases the differences may be associated with greater risk o f  extinction, such as the island trend toward the evolution o f flightlessness (Diamond 1981; McNab 1994; Roff 1994). However, other traits may be neutral in terms o f extinction risk, or reduce a species vulnerability to extinction. The traits that187Conclusionwere demonstrated to consistently change in an island environment such as sexual body size dimorphism or clutch size were not associated with elevated rates o f  extinction (see Chapter 5). Many traits or conditions have been associated with island birds, but few have been rigorously tested. To understand more about island birds and why they may be particularly extinction prone or resilient we must establish which traits or conditions can be truly generalised. Research into trends on islands such as mating systems, parental care, fidelity, territoriality, nesting location, annual fecundity, age o f maturity, longevity, survivorship, niche shifts, and density compensation would all greatly improve our understanding o f the unique nature o f island endemic birds. It would also be interesting to explore how these traits vary with different stages o f endemism.Analyses in Chapter 3 support the notion that endemic birds on islands that have been exposed to humans for a long period o f time have experienced lower rates o f recent extinction. This indicates that there have been ‘extinction filters’ (Coope 1995; Balmford 1996) whereby past threats have stripped out vulnerable species leaving a more resilient though less diverse species complement. Evidence o f an extinction filter can be found in both the Pacific and non-Pacific. There is a similar, but much weaker relationship between the length o f time an island has been colonised by humans and the proportion o f species that are threatened with extinction. A closer examination o f the threat processes indicates that birds on islands that have been colonised by humans for a long period o f time are less threatened by the introduction o f exotic species. No relationship is found between the extent o f  human colonisation and the proportion o f species that are threatened by exploitation or habitat loss.The examination o f extinction filters enables us to infer important processes o f extinction in the distant past and gain insight into whether the dominant processes o f extinction have changed over time. If  extinction processes in the distant past are similar to recent threat processes, then birds on islands that have been colonised by humans for a long period o f time should now appear more resilient to extinction. I f  the dominant threat processes change or intensify, there may be no relationship between past resilience and present or future persistence. This is because new or more intense extinction processes are novel to all species. The strong relationship between the date o f first human colonisation o f an island with the proportion o f species that have recently gone extinct, but weak relationship with the proportion o f birds that are at present threatened, indicates that the dominant processes o f extinction may be changing.188ConclusionIf species are more resilient to a specific threat process on islands that have been colonised for a long period o f time, then the specific threat process was likely a significant cause o f prehistoric human-caused avian extinctions. Thus, the introduction o f exotic species was likely a dominant process o f extinction when humans first colonised oceanic islands.The analyses from Chapter 3 support that the first human colonists to oceanic islands have been responsible for extensive endemic bird extinctions on islands throughout the world and that the process o f  extinction has recently changed. The role o f humans as an extinction filter is supported by subfossil records o f extinct island endemics (Olson and James 1982; Diamond 1982, 1984, 1989; Cassels 1984; Olson 1989; Dye and Steadman 1990; Milberg and Tyberg 1993; Pimm et al. 1994; Steadman 1990,1993,1995, 1998). The changing process o f extinction, as well as the past importance o f introduced species as an extinction process, are supported by the analysis in Chapter 1, demonstrating that recent extinctions were primarily caused by introduced species, but now habitat loss is becoming the dominant process o f extinction (also see King 1985; Johnson and Stattersfield 1990; Collar et al. 1994; Stattersfield et al. 1998; Russell 1998; Simberloff 2000).This study reinforces that researchers focusing on island endemic species must consider that the flora and fauna remaining today may only represent a small subset o f what existed prior to the arrival o f  humans. It also demonstrates that it is important to have an understanding o f historical extinction processes, as past causes o f extinction can have a strong influence on present patterns o f susceptibility. However, in the case o f islands, as habitat loss intensifies, resilience to past extinction processes will have little influence on a species future probability o f survival. Habitat loss is also a relatively non-selective extinction process (Russell 1998) which may function more as an extinction blanket than an extinction filter. For future studies o f  this nature it may be interesting to further refine categories o f threat. For example, divide species threatened by introductions into those threatened by competitors and those threatened by predators, or divide species threatened by exploitation into species that are hunted for food and those that are collected for the pet trade.The analyses in Chapter 4 indicate that species inhabiting oceanic islands that have been exposed to humans for a long period o f time are less likely to be ground nesters,189Conclusionflightless birds, and non-forest specialists. There was no significant association when a species’ clutch size or body size was considered. These analyses indicate that the presence o f human-related threats has radically altered the selection regime on oceanic islands. Humans may have been responsible for the virtual eradication o f specific traits o f island endemic birds. Assuming this is true, endemic species found on islands today are not a random subset o f those that existed prior to the arrival o f humans.If the traits most vulnerable to extinction are associated with higher levels o f endemism, then a disproportionate number o f the phylogenetically unique island species may have been driven to extinction. For example, flightless extinct species such as the dodo, moas or flightless waterfowl o f Hawaii represented unique lineages. Many o f the remaining flightless birds are also very unique, such as the kagu or kakapo. The findings from Chapter 4 also indicate that the traits associated with greater extinction risk may rapidly change as a new extinction process is introduced. For example, flightlessness or ground nesting may not have rendered a species at greater risk of extinction prior to the arrival o f  humans. Here only flightless or poorly flighted birds, ground nesting species, and non-forest-restricted endemics have been identified as traits that may be in the process o f being filtered from the island system. It would be interesting to search for other traits that are also being selectively removed. Traits that may be o f particular interest are sexually selected characteristics, mating systems, and specific guilds.Chapter 5 demonstrates that there is no significant difference between the overall extinction risk o f oceanic island and mainland birds, i f  species with similar distributions are compared. However, when the processes o f threat are examined individually, island birds are significantly more threatened by introduced species. The analyses from chapter 3 and 4 in addition to the subfossil remains o f extinct island endemic birds provide strong evidence that threat rates may now be similar simply because many of the vulnerable species have already been driven to extinction. The analyses conducted here compare island and mainland species with similar distributions. However, a more refined analysis with exact distributions for mainland species may provide greater insight into the processes o f  extinction for which island and mainland birds are particularly susceptible. The fact that island birds are disproportionately vulnerable to introduced species highlights the importance o f introduced species eradication programs190Conclusionon islands in conjunction with greater controls on the transport and introduction of exotics (see Simberloff 2000).The results from Chapter 5 also suggest that on oceanic islands, flightless species and habitat specialists are at present more threatened with extinction than other species. If only birds that have been exposed to humans for less than 1000 years are considered, then ground nesters and larger birds are also at greater risk o f extinction. Regardless o f whether species have or have not been exposed to humans for a long time, sexually size dimorphic birds, dichromatic species, and birds with a small clutch size are not associated with a greater probability o f extinction.Chapters 3 ,4 , and 5 suggest that we should think carefully before we make generalisations about extinction prone traits. The traits that we identify as extinction prone will depend on the specific threat process (Owens and Bennett 2000; Chapter 4) as well as the extinction processes that have taken place in the distant past (Chapter 3). Thus, traits that are associated with more vulnerable species in one region many not be applicable to another if  the processes o f extinction are different, or the extinction filters have acted on different temporal scales. We must develop a much more sophisticated understanding o f the temporal and spatial relationship between process o f extinction and traits associated with greater vulnerability i f  we wish to make sound predictions about which species will be the most vulnerable to future extinction.Research earned out on Principe in the G ulf o f  Guinea suggests that two of the seven island endemic birds qualify as vulnerable to extinction, based on the IUCN Categories and Criteria (see IUCN 1994). The vulnerable species are Principe speirops Speirops leucophaeus and Principe drongo Dicrurus modes tus, and have been classified as threatened based on their relatively small distributions. Two o f the eight subspecies qualify as critically endangered (Olive Ibis Bostrychia olivácea rothsckildi and Principe White-eye Zosterops ficedulinus ficedulinus) and one as vulnerable (G ulf o f Guinea Thrush Turdus olivaceqfuscus xanthorhynchus). No recent endemic bird extinctions have been documented on Principe, and the native island birds still remain the most abundant species on the island (Snow 1950). The endemic birds o f Principe are extremely resilient considering that roughly one quarter o f  the endemic birds on islands off the coast o f Africa have gone extinct over the past 500 years and that 42% o f African island endemic birds are at present threatened with extinction (see Chapter 1).191Conclusion ___________________________________________Their resilience is even more remarkable given that most o f the island was at one point under cultivation, virtually every mammalian predator that has been a menace on oceanic islands has been introduced to the island, and many o f the endemic birds have been subject to human exploitation.The key to their persistence appears to be a combination o f biogeographic features and land-use history. First, Principe is relatively close to the mainland (220 km) which may result in a greater species area relationship than exists in equivalent, more distant islands, as well as greater exposure to migrants or vagrants. This would result in the island endemics having greater evolutionary experience with competitors, predators, and disease than species on more remote islands or archipelagos. Greater extinction risk on more remote islands is supported by the analysis in Chapter 3. Second, the thick rainforest environment provides excellent cover and nesting sites that may reduce species susceptibility to introduced predators. Observations in the rainforest also indicate that human commensal predators are much less abundant in this environment. Third, the agricultural transformation o f the landscape resulted in the removal o f much o f the native vegetation, but crops such as cocoa maintained a forest structure. Fourth, the land use history o f Principe is relatively unique. Most o f the island is now covered in thick tropical rainforest, but at the beginning o f the 1900s only the mountain forest and a small section o f the southern lowlands remained uncultivated. In the early 1900s, the mountain forest and the southern lowlands likely served as a refuge, providing native habitat and an environment with reduced predation by introduced predators and human exploitation. If  the land use history o f Principe followed that o f most other oceanic islands, the present threatened status and the number o f  recent extinctions o f the avifauna would undoubtedly be similar.This case study suggests that island endemic birds may be extremely resilient to extinction if  their native habitat is maintained and they have had at least limited historic exposure to competitors, predators, and disease. This reinforces the point that conservationists’ main objective should be to maintain and regenerate native habitat on oceanic islands, and on remote islands to focus more energy on the eradication or reduction o f introduced competitors or predators. It is rarely a viable option to conserve island endemic birds without their native habitat. Such conservation efforts often lead to expensive and unsustainable strategies such as captive breading and supplementary feeding. If we are serious about maintaining viable endemic bird populations into the192C on clu siondistant future, then we need to focus on protecting species for which adequate habitat remains or can realistically be regenerated.Chapter 7 demonstrates that the Principe seedeater Serinus rufobrunnea fradei, located on Bone de Joquei in the Gulf o f Guinea, is found in all habitat types on the island and has an extremely high population density. Competitive release and or density compensation are often observed in island endemic bird populations (Crowell 1962;Mac Arthur et al. 1972; Blondel 1991) and may help to explain why many island birds are able to persist within extremely small distributions (Manne et al. 1999). Higher population densities will reduce a species risk o f extinction due to environmental or demographic stochasticity as well as the negative genetic effects associated with small populations. Density inflation and or density compensation may be dependent on few competitors, few predators, and an abundant food supply. Understanding and managing for the driving mechanisms that allow for higher population densities may be essential for the future survival o f many restricted-range island endemic populations.It would be useful to have a better understanding o f the extent to which elevated population densities occur on oceanic islands. However, it is important to note that the introduction o f predators or competitors to islands may have greatly reduced the occurrence o f this phenomenon. Many species on small oceanic islands may not appear particularly threatened because they have average population densities. Such species may be overlooked by conservationists, while in actuality, their long-term persistence is greatly compromised by the recent loss o f super-abundance.The results form this thesis suggest that (1) there are convergent life history or morphological trends that occur when species become endemic on oceanic islands; (2) patterns o f prehistoric human-caused extinctions influence the areas where recent extinctions have occurred, but will have little influence on where future extinctions take place; (3) extinction processes are changing on islands, as many o f the species that were particularly prone to introductions are now extinct and habitat destruction has recently intensified; (4) species with specific life history or ecological traits may have been selectively removed from oceanic islands by human-related threats; (5) extinction risk is similar for oceanic island and mainland species when species with similar distributions are compared; (6) the processes o f  extinction are similar on islands and the mainland, but island species are particularly vulnerable to introduced species; (7)193C on clu sionoceanic island birds that are flightless, ground nesting, large bodied or forest restricted may be at greater risk o f extinction than other birds; (8) the resilience o f the endemic birds o f Príncipe may be associated with the unique land use history, rainforest habitat and their relatively close proximity to the mainland; (9) super abundant population densities may be essential for the long term persistence o f birds on small isolated islands. The aim of this thesis has been to further our understanding o f the process o f extinction occurring on oceanic islands and it is hoped that the research presented here will """"have both theoretical and practical applications for the conservation o f island- endemic species.194C on clu sionReferencesBalmford, A. 1996.

As a result o f human activities many species have gone extinct, others are restricted to tiny islands o f remaining habitat, and still others are committed to extinction in the near future.For still larger numbers, the future looks extremely uncertain. Recent assessments o f the global conservation status o f species (IUCN 1996, Oldfield et al. 1998) suggest that more than 10 percent o f birds and around 20 percent o f mammals and amphibians are now threatened with extinction (table 2). Comprehensive assessments o f all native U.S. species by the Nature Conservancy show that over 60 percent o f molluscs and crayfish, 40 percent o f freshwater fishes and amphibians, and 50 percent o f freshwater invertebrates are at risk. Extinction risk also is demonstrably nonrandom; species within some phylogenetic clades tend to have higher or lower levels o f  extinction risk than across taxa as a whole, thereby increasing the loss o f evolutionary diversity from species extinctions (Russell et al. 1998, Purvis et al. 2000a). Extinctions are also nonrandom with respect to the ecological roles that species play, so that loss o f  species will have an impact on ecosystem and community (Jemvall and Wright 1998).The situation is more serious still for some taxonomic groups in especially vulnerable habitats. Certain dramatic evolutionary radiations have been almost completely eliminated. For example, until the mid-1980s over 120 land snail species o f  the snail family Partulidae were distributed across the islands o f Polynesia; almost all are now either critically endangered or extinct as a result o f  the introduction o f a predatory snail (Mace et al. 1998). The introduction o f the Nile perch (Lates niloticus) to Lake Victoria198Appendix Assessment and management of species at risk___________________________in East Africa has now led to the extinction o f up to 200 species o f haplochromine cichlid fishes that once formed a unique “species flock” with extraordinary levels of morphological, ecological, and behavioural specializations. These examples illustrate the intensity and potential o f the current extinction spasm.From the perspective o f a research agenda, we need to analyze the causes and understand the processes that ultimately lead to species extinction, and thus identify methods and approaches to mitigate the problem. In this chapter we review some key issues for the assessment and management o f species at risk.Processes Leading to Extinction: Habitat Loss, Overexploitation, and Introduced SpeciesSpecies have always gone extinct. The fossil record bears testament to the extinctions of both species and entire evolutionary radiations, and extant species probably represent only about 2-4 percent o f all species that have ever lived (May et al. 1995). The fragmentary nature o f the fossil record makes direct comparison o f ancient extinctions with modem extinction problematic (Jablonski 1995). Most paleontological data come from marine invertebrates, usually o f  abundant and widespread taxa, while modem extinctions have mostly been cataloged for terrestrial vertebrates, many o f which were relatively rare and narrowly distributed. Some authors have suggested that, based on the average persistence time o f species in the fossil record o f between 0.5 and 10 million years, the current extinction rate may be from 100 to 1,000, and perhaps 10,000, times higher than background extinction rates (May et al. 1995, Pimm et al. 1995).Extinction rates have varied throughout the fossil record, with noticeable peaks during periods o f mass extinction (Jablonski 1991, Benton 1995, May et al. 1995). The rates that we expect over the coming centuries may begin to approach the most severe periods o f extinction in the earth’s history (Jablonski 1995). Unlike the mass extinctions o f the past, however, the driving processes are not attributable to abiotic geological changes nor extraterrestrial impacts. Instead, the direct and indirect causes are almost entirely due to human activities. Our analysis o f  the nature o f extinctions must therefore start with a consideration o f these ultimate driving processes.The major processes leading to extinction are anthropogenic and result from habitat loss, overexploitation, introduced species, and the interactions among these (Diamond199Appendix Assessment and management of species at risk___________________________1989). These processes may be regarded as the extrinsic drivers, the ultimate causes o f extinction as described by Simberloff (1986), or the agents behind the “declining population paradigm” described by Caughley (1994).Habitat loss is probably the most common problem, especially for continental species (WCMC 1992, Mace and Balmford 2000). Human population growth and development lead to the appropriation o f extensive areas o f land for settlement, agriculture, and resource extraction, and the infrastructure to support these activities causes further loss and fragmentation. Habitat loss does not just imply clearance but also all kinds of degradation and fragmentation that limit the potential for wild species to persist. Over large continental areas, for example in northwest Europe and eastern North America, natural habitats are now reduced to a tiny proportion o f their historical extent, and many o f the land areas set aside for wildlife are degraded and left for conservation management largely because they are unsuitable for development. As the patches of remaining habitat become smaller and more isolated, the species living within them are more likely to go extinct and individuals from neighboring patches are unable to immigrate to repopulate the patch. In eastern North America, species extinctions have been recorded at a rate consistent with simple models concerning the effects o f habitat loss (Pimm and Askins 1995). Other regions, such as the species-rich eastern coastal forests o f  Brazil, which have endured relatively recent yet extensive clearance, have so far suffered few recorded extinctions. However, there are large numbers o f species restricted to small remaining patches o f forest which, though not extinct, appear to have very bleak prospects (Brooks and Balmford 1996). Following their isolation in habitat remnants, species may persist for some time before finally succumbing, (Brooks et al. 1999, Cowlishaw 1999) perhaps giving us too optimistic a view o f the eventual impact o f  our current activities.Overexploitation can take a variety o f forms, from large-scale commercial extraction of fishes and forests to local, subsistence hunting. There are often limited controls to the access to wildlife resources providing little incentive to manage the resource sustainably (Hardin 1999). This creates competition that is hard to regulate efficiently, even when there are technical and financial resources to do so (Ludwig et al. 1993). Despite extensive research into methods for sustainably harvesting natural populations, there are still many difficulties in estimating key parameters and implementing and enforcing management plans (Ludwig et al. 1993, Lande et al. 1994). As a result, for example,200Appendix Assessment and management of species at risk___________________________although the total commercial catches o f marine fishes have been relatively constant over the last few decades, FAO data show a shift in catch records from long-lived, high trophic level, piscivorous bottom fish toward short-lived, low trophic level invertebrates and planktivorous pelagic fish. These trends signal unsustainable exploitation o f marine resources and seem likely to have both direct and indirect impacts on oceanic food webs and communities (Pauly et al. 1998). Indeed, several commercially exploited fish species now show continuing declines in abundance despite international agreements to control their harvest rates (Cook et al. 1997, Myers et al. 1997, Matsuda et al. 1998). Large, long-lived, and slowly reproducing species appear to be the most vulnerable to declines from commercial fishing, (Jennings et al. 1998) and one such species, the barndoor skate (Raja laevis), now appears to be close to extinction (Casey and Myers 1998).At more local scales, overharvesting for food, fuel wood, pets, ornaments, and trophies continues to threaten many species. Although international agreements limit the trade in wild species among countries, there are difficulties in controlling exploitation within countries, especially where the wildlife products are o f  high commercial value (e.g., elephants (Milner-Gulland and Beddington 1993)). Many wild species are also unsustainably harvested in tropical forests as a source o f protein (e.g., neotropical vertebrates; Alvard (1997)). For bushmeat there is a serious threat to many wildlife species because the characteristics that make species attractive as a source o f protein, such as large body size, also make the species especially vulnerable to overhunting (Robinson and Redford 1991).Introductions and translocations o f species to areas outside their natural ranges are now, and have been, a major driver o f anthropogenic extinctions. Many species, especially in areas that have been settled by people from distant lands, have already been driven extinct by introduced species. Pimm et al. (1994) estimate that the Polynesians wiped out 500 to 1,000 bird species in their early explorations across the Western Pacific, and introductions continue to pose a serious threat to island species (WCMC 1992). Similarly, the Australian mammal fauna has suffered directly and indirectly from introduced species, especially European native species brought by early settlers (Burbidge and McKenzie 1989). The highly diverse endemic plant radiation o f the Cape Floristic province o f South Africa is threatened by both invasive species and land use changes. Successful invasive species generally tend to be short-lived, with high intrinsic201rates o f increase, i.e., early successional species. Although they outcompete native species in the short term, over the long term, the ability o f some invasive species to persist may be limited. In contrast, the species that are most susceptible to the effects of introduced species are those that inhabit isolated regions and occupy habitats that have been heavily modified by anthropogenic influences, (Godffay and Crawley 1998) where they may suffer population declines and extinction from competition, predation, or hybridization.Consequences of Extrinsic, Human-caused PerturbationsA species’ vulnerability to extrinsic threats is often influenced by its ecology, life history, physiology, or distribution. Intrinsic characteristics o f extinction-prone species have been more thoroughly investigated by research biologists than have the effects o f the external drivers and the interactions between the two (Caughley 1994), leading to some debate about the relative importance o f each. However, it is clear that both factors should be considered if  we are to improve the reliability o f predictions about extinction risk (Hedrick et al. 1996, Beissinger and Westphal 1998).Several kinds o f evidence provide information about the most vulnerable species. First, empirical studies have identified intrinsic characteristics o f extinction-prone species. Rates o f local extinction have been shown to be higher for species that have restricted ranges or occupy a small number o f sites (Hanski 1982, Simberloff and Gotelli 1984, Thomas and Mallorie 1985, Happel et al. 1987, Gaston 1994, Gaston and Blackburn 1996, Gaston and Chown 1999), are local endemics (Terborgh and Winter 1980, Cowling and Bond 1991) or have low abundances, high temporal population variability, and poor dispersal (Karr 1982, Diamond 1984, Pimm et al. 1988, Newmark 1991, Gaston 1994). These studies are all open to the criticism that they may only be investigating correlates o f extinction-prone characteristics, since body size, dispersal ability, range size, population variability, and local population density are all interrelated (McArdle et al. 1990, Pimm 1992, Gaston 1994, Gaston and Blackburn1996). In studies where interrelationships among life history traits and the geographical sampling can be controlled, extinction risk has been shown to be higher for species with low population density, small range size, and habitat and diet specializations (Foufopoulos and Ives 1999, Purvis et al. 2000b). The response o f  a species to a threat is complicated and depends on its life history, the local environmental conditions and the specific perturbation. For example, the stability o f fluctuating populations is reducedA p p en d ix  A ssessm en t and m anagem ent o f  sp ec ies  at risk______________________________________202Appendix Assessment and management of species at risk___________________________by exploitation; (Beddington and May 1977), the response o f primates to logging is a function o f their home range size and the latitude at which they live (a correlate o f habitat variability); (Harcourt 1997) and extinction o f carnivores within reserves is higher for those with large home ranges (Woodroffe and Ginsberg 1998).Second, there are some useful insights from ecological and life history theory. It can be shown that small populations are more extinction-prone because o f their susceptibility to demographic stochasticity (Richter-Dyn and Goel 1972, Goodman 1987), the increased expression o f recessive deleterious alleles under inbreeding (Soule 1980,Soule and Mills 1998), the change in quantitative characters that allow adaptation, and the accumulation o f mildly deleterious mutations (Hedrick and Miller 1992, Frankham 1995a).Lande (1998) has reviewed these various processes in terms o f the minimum viable population sizes that they imply. This has shown that demographic stochasticity is unlikely to be important for any population that has more than one hundred individuals, but random environmental variation or catastrophes are important for populations o f all sizes, and they become more significant as environmental variability becomes large in relation to the population growth rate (Lande 1993).In terms o f genetic effects, deleterious recessive alleles become more likely to be expressed when populations are reduced in number. The resulting inbreeding depression may increase short term extinction probabilities for N e’s up to 50 -  100 (Mills and Smouse 1994, Allendorf and Ryman in press), translating to effects on actual population size in the range o f  200 to 500 individuals (Soule et al. 1986, Mace and Lande 1991, Frankham 1995b). To preserve quantitative trait variation, larger populations are needed. One estimate is that to maintain high levels (more than 90 percent) over thousands o f years will require minimum effective population sizes o f at least 5,000, and to prevent the accumulation o f mildly deleterious mutations over tens o f thousands o f years will require minimum effective population sizes o f  around 10,000 to 100,000. Because o f difficulties in estimating key parameter values for these calculations (Franklin and Frankham 1998, Lynch and Lande 1998), the critical population sizes from these theoretical studies are best interpreted as guides to the relative importance o f different characteristics rather than real thresholds for203management (Lande 1998). Moreover, this approach is deficient because it lacks a treatment o f the feedbacks between genetics and demography (Soule and Mills 1998).Our analysis o f  the extrinsic and intrinsic factors associated with increased extinction risk has covered much of the field o f ecology and evolutionary biology. In order to identify key questions, we now analyze issues that are o f practical significance for conservation practitioners.C ritical Gaps in KnowledgeIn discussing the critical gaps in our knowledge about how to protect species at risk, we examine six major areas. Research priorities for these six areas are given in table 1.The research areas are:•  Patterns o f species at risk• Dynamics o f threatening processes• Dynamics o f population persistence in a changing world• The effectiveness o f different management strategies•  Conservation in practice• Adaptive management monitoringEach o f these subjects is discussed below, and pertinent research questions are identified. First we discuss research questions, then move on to management actions.Research Questions1. Identifying Patterns o f Species at RiskThe first set o f research questions requires an analysis o f patterns - a simple accounting o f where the most species are located and what their relative risks o f extinction, endemism, and diversity are. Along with patterns o f biodiversity it is important to document the distribution and intensity o f  dominant processes o f threat throughout different regions o f the world. The above issues are particularly relevant to the design o f networks o f protected areas (Soul6 and Terborgh 1999). This approach has been widely explored and used for planning at both global and regional levels. Through such studies, high-priority areas, habitats, and ecosystems have been identified and targeted for action (Myers 1988, Myers 1990, Pressey et al. 1993, Beissinger et al. 1996, Williams 1998). Species are not distributed evenly over the earth’s surface and neither are the centers o f richness, endemism, or threat particularly well correlated across taxa (WCMC 2000), especially in certain regions such as the United Kingdom and SouthA p p en d ix  A ssessm en t and m anagem ent o f  sp ec ies  at risk_____________________________________204Appendix Assessment and management of species at risk___________________________Africa (Prendergast et al. 1993, vanJaarsveld et al. 1998). In other areas, there are higher congruence patterns o f species’ complementarity among sites, such as forest patches in Uganda (Howard et al. 1998). In general, however, the concordance among diversity, endemism, and threat—three different measures o f the conservation importance o f an area-also varies with scale and location (Balmford and Long 1995, Kershaw et al. 1995) and presents some difficult choices for those setting conservation priorities (Margules et al. 1988, Pressey et al. 1996).2. Dynamics o f Threatening ProcessesAnalyzing patterns provides only a partial solution. The viability o f  populations and species ultimately depends upon population and evolutionary dynamics. Within any particular area, species will not share similar future prospects. Those that are highly adaptable (genetically, behaviourally, or both), have good dispersal abilities, or with populations whose prospects are more favorable will be expected to have enhanced viabilities. Therefore, we consider the dynamics o f threatening processes and their likely impact upon affected species.3. Dynamics o f Persisting in a Changing WorldA simple consideration o f threatening processes reveals that these change in nature and intensity over both time and space-sometimes at alarming rates. This is one reason why analyses o f  patterns do not provide a sufficient basis for management (Smith et al. 1993, Balmford et al. 1998). Our third set o f research topics considers studies on how species at risk can cope with dynamic change.Currently, dynamic changes are accentuated as a result o f  the rapid human population expansion. Numbers are still increasing rapidly, although at different rates in different areas o f  the world (Cohen 1995). Globally, human numbers are expected to double over the next 60 years (McNeely et al. 1995). While some regions, such as Europe and North America, are expected to meet their resource needs without further land conversion for agriculture, many other areas are still undergoing rapid development alongside high population growth. Food requirements may double in Central and South America and Asia, and perhaps increase fivefold in Africa (WCMC 2000). Land use changes will therefore proceed inexorably in some areas o f  high biodiversity. This demand, and its likely impact on wild species, needs to be understood and managed i f  conservation activities are to be successful. Even in more stable areas o f  the world, changing patterns205o f work and leisure are leading to migrations from urban to rural areas, with significant consequences for land use planning. Habitat loss and fragmentation will continue but at different rates and in different ways than in the past.One o f the difficulties with the dynamic nature o f land changes is that past trends are often not a reliable predictor o f  the future. Human activities also present a new challenge in the form o f global climate change. Current predictions about changes in average temperatures suggest that the impacts will vary regionally and across habitats. There may be profound influences on marine ecosystems, which could experience an increased frequency and intensity o f oceanic perturbations with consequences for many marine fish and corals. Global patterns o f seawater circulation are expected to alter as a result o f increased surface temperatures, which may have consequences for sea levels and for climate in both island and continental areas. Some parts o f the land surface, especially temperate and arctic zones, are expected to face large temperature changes, and there is already evidence that European bird and butterfly species ranges are shifting to higher latitudes and the animals are altering egg-laying dates in response to current warming trends (Crick and Sparks 1999, Hill et al. 1999, Thomas and Lennon 1999). Under systematic warming, species persistence will depend on a different set of traits than those that offer high fitness in more stable habitats. All this underlines the importance o f studying and understanding the spatial, temporal, and adaptational characteristics o f species. For example, a study o f a forest savannah in Cameroon indicated that, although ecotones have generally been regarded as unimportant areas, natural selection operating on birds in the ecotone may be important for generating evolutionary novelties (Smith et al. 1993).M anagem ent ActionsThe final three groups o f research priorities discussed below focus on ways to use knowledge gained from research in the development, implementation, and assessment o f  management activities. Many conservation practices have been tried in the past, some with much more success than others. Unfortunately these experiences are often poorly documented and knowledge disappears with the people who were responsible for it. There is a need for a more systematic approach to analyzing and synthesizing alternative approaches.A p p en d ix  A ssessm en t and m anagem ent o f  sp ec ies  at risk______________________________________206Appendix Assessment and management of species at risk__________________________4. Assessing the Effectiveness o f Different Management StrategiesIn this section, we focus on the more biological aspects o f management at both the population and ecosystem levels. Fundamental principles from population biology were first developed a couple o f decades ago (Soulé 1987). There are now a variety o f ever more sophisticated techniques for population management that incorporate environmental and human processes in various forms o f Population Viability Analysis (PVA) (Boyce 1992, Burgman et al. 1993). While some empirical evidence suggests that these models are reliable predictors o f future population trends (Brook et al. 2000), it is unclear how robust they are as management tools when vital rates are well known (Fieberg and Ellner 2000), let alone under uncertainty and catastrophic change (Mangel and Tier 1994, Ludwig 1996), and it is also unclear how best to incorporate many different variables and their interactions into such models (Beissinger and Westphal1998) .5. Conservation appliedCulture and place affect the choice o f conservation tactics. For example, the United States has strong species-based legislation that provides protection for the habitats of listed species in their native areas, whereas in Australia and New Zealand translocations, introductions, and réintroductions have been extensively used for some highly endangered species (Serena and Williams 1994). The role o f  captive breeding has been widely debated (Hutchins et al. 1995, Balmford et al. 1996, Snyder et al. 1996). The practitioners o f  many regions focus conservation efforts on the design, implementation, and management o f  protected areas and reserves (Soulé and Terborgh1999) . In a rapidly changing environment and landscape it is increasingly difficult to design protected areas that will be efficient in the future. Placing reserves at natural landscape scales with edges at natural boundaries should be efficient (Peres and Terborgh 1995), but the designs and configuration o f reserve areas may need to be altered to cope with systematic environmental changes, especially climate change.We recognize both the challenges and benefits associated with local human communities whose immediate needs and aspirations may conflict with those o f biodiversity conservation. While some apparent conflicts are illusory, in other cases strategies and approaches can be taken that will be more effective at achieving multiple short- and long-term goals. It is in this area in particular that conservation biologists must move into more interdisciplinary scientific communities and work with207Appendix Assessment and management of species at risk___________________________economists, sociologists, land planners, and human demographers to achieve effective results.6. Adaptive Management and MonitoringA long-term approach to management that includes both monitoring, analysis o f actions, and adaptive management is important. Once management plans are in place, evaluate the predetermined goals and objectives regularly; if  the actions are not proceeding according to plan, then the reasons need to be identified and alterations made (Margoluis and Salafsky 1998). For effective adaptive management, a great deal o f planning must be undertaken at the start, with agreement among various stakeholders about what the indicators o f altered management might be. Biologists should play an active role in such planning to ensure that the biological principles at the heart o f any management plan are not compromised as implementation proceeds.Table 1.

Summary results of the application of IUCN criteria to various higher taxonomic groupings. The approximate number of species assessed is estimated from IUCN (1996) and Oldfield et al. (1998). The figure in parentheses indicates the proportion assessed of the total species diversity on the group. Since assessors may focus on the most threatened species, and on those that are well known, the threat and data deficiency rates may become more unrepresentative as the proportion of species assessed decreases.Taxon Approximate number of species assessed ( percent total)percent threatened of those assessedpercent DD of total assessedMammals 4763 (100 percent) 23 percent 5Birds 9946 (100 percent) 11 percent 1Reptiles 1480 (20 percent) 17 percent 5Amphibians 600 (12 percent) 21 percent 7Molluscs >3000 (4 percent) 31 percent 18Trees 10,091 (?0.1 percent) 59 percent 4212A p p en d ix  A ssessm en t and m an agem ent o f  sp ec ies  at riskReferencesAllendorf, F.

The specimens were collected during a recent zoological expedition by the Zoological Society o f London. This is the first record o f the occurrence o f freshwater crabs on the island o f Principe.IntroductionThe freshwater crabs reported on here were collected during a zoological expedition to the island o f Principe, made recently by the Zoological Society o f  London. The island o f Principe, together with the island o f Sào Tomé, constitute a small independent republic (The Democratic Republic o f Sào Tomé and Príncipe) in the G ulf o f Guinea. Principe is the second in a chain o f  islands that make up the Atlantic Ocean Islands group, that lies off the coasts o f Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. The other islands in this group are Bioko, Sào Tomé and Annobon. Bioko is closest to the mainland and has two species o f freshwater crabs, Sudanonautes floweri (De Man,1901) and S. granulatus (Balss, 1929), both o f which are also found in nearby Cameroon (Cumberlidge, 1993,1995,1999). Sào Tomé is the third island in the group, and has one species o f endemic freshwater crab, Potamonautes margaritarius (A. Milne-Edwards, 1886). There are no records o f freshwater crabs occurring on Annobon, the fourth island in the chain, and the furthest from the mainland.Until the present report freshwater crabs were not known to be present on Principe. The new species from Principé was observed in streams, and collected in cloud forest in the remote roadless highlands. The new species is compared to Potamonautes anchietae (Brito-Capello, 1871) and to P. margaritarius, but differs from each in a number o f218A p p en d ix  A  n ew  sp ec ies  o f  fresh water crabfBrachvura: Potam oidea: P otam onautidaelimportant characters (Bott, 1953, 1955,1964). Although the specimens from Principe are both subadult females, and ideally an adult male is needed to make a definitive identification, a preliminary description is provided here, based on several unique somatic characters o f the specimen. Characters o f the gonopods, male abdomen, and male chelipeds will be described when more material (including an adult male) becomes available.Figures were prepared using a camera lucida, and the specimens were deposited in the Natural History Museum, London, U.K. (NHM).

Adult size range o f P. principe sp. n. beginning at cw 41 mm. The colour o f the specimens when freshly caught (before alcohol preservation) was creamy white with a very light purplish tone, however one specimen was more white than the other. This coloration was relatively uniform throughout the body including the dorsal carapace, underside, and legs. The purplish tone was darker on the carapace just behind the eyes, which turned to an orange reddish color once the specimens were placed in alcohol.Ecological notesThe island o f Principé is ovoid in outline, with a total land area o f  139km2 (Figure 3). The highest point on the island is the Pico de Principé (945m), a volcanic mountain whose lower slopes are vegetated by lowland rainforest that grades into cloud forest along the summit o f the mountain. The climate o f  Principe is tropical, hot, and humid, and there are two dry seasons and two wet seasons. The driest months are July and August, and from the end o f December to beginning o f January, while the wettest months are October, November, March and April. Rainfall levels are high, averaging 1000mm in the north and up to 5,000 mm per year in the south, and monthly temperatures range between 25° and 31° C (Bredero et a l, 1977). The two specimens were collected from the summit o f the Pico do Principe at 945 meters above sea level on221Appendix A new species of fresh water crabiBrachvura: Potamoidea: Potamonautidae')_____two separate occasions. The terrain at the summit o f the Pico do Principe is volcanic and mountainous, and the vegetation cover is cloud forest with small stunted trees, and a high abundance o f epiphytes and bryophytes. The thick cloud cover and regular rainfall keep the soil and leaf litter very damp. On both occasions when crabs were collected the weather was extremely damp and the mountain top engulfed in cloud cover. Both specimens were collected on land from under damp and decaying leaf litter. There was no river or body o f water near the location where the specimens were found. The nearest stream was observed at lower altitudes (830 m), but temporary small pools form near the summit after heavy rain. It is likely that P. principe can breathe air, given its extremely terrestrial lifestyle. When crabs were disturbed by removing the leaf litter cover, they ran rapidly across the forest floor and took cover under leaf litter or any available crevasse. Holes that might have been dug by these crabs were found near where the crabs were collected, but crabs were not actually observed moving in or out o f these holes.ComparisonPotamonautes principe sp. n. is closest to P. anchietae, a medium-sized species of freshwater crab from Angola (Brito-Capello, 1871, Bott, 1953,1955,1964). This species was most recently described and illustrated by Bott (1955, p. 247-249, figures. 24, 76, 77, pi. IX, figure, la-d) as P. (Isopotamonautes) anchietae. Potamonautes principe sp. n. and P. anchietae are similar in that both species have a highly arched carapace, a prominent and complete postfrontal crest, a pointed exorbital tooth, a small granular epibranchial tooth, a v-shaped thoracic sternal groove s3/s4, and a similar-sized first carpal tooth on the carpus o f the cheliped. However, there are a number of characters that distinguish the specimens from Vissabenguilla, Angola (SMF 1890) described by Bott (1955) as P. (I.) anchietae) from the specimens from Principe under consideration here.For example, the carapace height o f P. principe sp. n. is greater than that o f P. anchietae (ch/fw P. principe 1.45, P. anchietae 1.19), and the frontal margin o f P. principe sp. n. is narrower than that o f P. anchietae (fw/cw P. principe sp. n. 0.26, P. anchietae 0.39). Further, the anterolateral margins o f the carapace o f P. principe sp. n. are completely smooth and lack teeth o f any kind, whereas these margins in P. anchietae are distinctly granular. The medial inferior margin o f the meras o f  the cheliped o f  P. principe sp. n. has a row o f distinct pointed teeth along its length, whereas this margin in P. anchietae,222Appendix A new species of fresh water crabfBrachvura: Potamoidea: Potamonautidael_____lacks teeth, and is either granular or smooth. Finally, the suborbital and pterygostomial regions o f  the carapace sidewall o f P. principe sp. n. are smooth, whereas these regions are distinctly granular in P. anchietae.Bott (1953, 1955, 1964) described two subspecies o f P. anchietae: P. (I.) a. biballensis Rathbun, 1905, and P. (I.) a. machedoi Bott, 1964, both o f which are found in Angola. However, comparison o f the types o f these taxa with P. principe sp. n. indicates that each one differs substantially from the new species described here. For example, the epibranchial tooth o f P. (I.) a. biballensis is large and pointed whereas that o f P. principe sp. n. is small and granular, and the carapace o f P. (I.) a. biballensis is flattened, whereas that P. principe sp. n. is high (ch/fw P. principe sp. n. 1.45, P. (I.) a. biballensis 1.25). Similarly, the epibranchial tooth o f P. (I.) a. machedoi is large and pointed whereas that o f P. principe sp. n. is small and granular, and the frontal margin o f P. principe sp. n. is narrower than that o f P. (I.) a. machedoi (fw/cw P. principe sp. n. 0.26, P. (I.) a. machedoi 0.33).Potamonautes principe sp. n. was compared here with a specimen o f P. margaritarius from S&o Tomé (SMF 2668), and the two taxa can be distinguished by the following characters. The carapace o f the latter species is distinctly flattened (ch/fw P. margaritarius 0.95, P. principe sp. n. 1.45), the anterolateral margin o f P. margaritarius behind the epibranchial tooth is clearly toothed (whereas this margin is completely smooth in P. principe sp. n.), and the ischium o f the third maxilliped o f P. margaritarius is smooth and lacks a vertical suture (whereas this suture is deep in P. principe sp. n.).Taxonomic remarksThe new species is assigned to Potamonautes because it possesses the following combination o f characters: the anterolateral margin lacks an intermediate tooth between the exorbital and epibranchial teeth; the mandibular palp is two-segmented; and the third maxilliped exopod has a long flagellum. Potamonautes is a widespread genus o f African freshwater crabs found throughout Africa from Senegal to the Horn o f Africa, and from Egypt to South Africa. Bott’s (1955) revision o f the freshwater crabs o f Africa recognised some 34 species in this genus. Since then the number o f  species o f Potamonautes has risen to more than sixty (Bott, 1959,1960,1964,1968,1970; Stewart et al., 1995; Stewart, 1997a,b; Daniels et al., 1998; Cumberlidge, 1999; Corace &223Appendix A new species of fresh water crabfBrachvura: Potamoidea: Potamonautidaet____Cumberlidge, 2001). Although Bott (1955) recognised fifteen subgenera of Potamonautes, the authors o f the present study prefer to follow Cumberlidge (1999) and use Potamonautes [sensu lato ] for all species, pending a revision o f the entire genus (Cumberlidge, unpublished).It is not normally good practice to describe a new species from a subadult female. However, we have decided to establish this taxon in the light o f the distinct nature o f the available morphological characters, and because o f the isolated nature o f the study area which may mean that further specimens o f P. principe sp. n. are unlikely to become available for some time. Characters o f the gonopods, adult male chelipeds, abdomen and sternum are not at present known because the only specimens o f P. principe sp. n. are subadult females. Nevertheless, there are a number o f unique characters that distinguish P. principe sp. n. from other species in the genus.EtymologyThe species is named for the island o f Principe where it was collected. The species name principe is a noun in apposition.Acknowledgments.

It is routinely invoked in the explanation of cognitive processes as diverse as memory retrieval, categorization, visual search, problem solving, learning, language processing, reasoning, and social behavior. At the same time, it is of fundamental practical concern to computer scientists concerned with clustering and machine learning, and it figures in many philosophical contexts. Crucially, ‘similar’ is not a relationship that simply reflects objective properties of the objects under consideration but rather is dependent on how those objects are represented by an observer.

We define the similarity in information theoretic terms, as the gain in coding length when shifting from independent encoding of the pair to joint encoding. Under simple Gaussian assumptions, this formulation leads to a non-Mahalanobis similarity function which is efficient and simple to learn. This function can be viewed as a likelihood ratio test, and we show that the optimal similaritypreserving projection of the data is a variant of Fisher Linear Discriminant. We also show that under some naturally occurring sampling conditions of equivalence constraints, this function converges to a known Mahalanobis distance (RCA). The suggested similarity function exhibits superior performance over alternative Mahalanobis distances learnt from the same data. Its superiority is demonstrated in the context of image retrieval and graph based clustering, using a large number of data sets. 1",,text,,,

We describe how a similarity no-tion between attributes can be defined by considering the values of other attributes. The basic idea is that in a 0/1 relation r, two attributes A and B are similar if the subrelations aA=l(r) and aB=~(r) are similar. Similarity between the two relations is defined by con-sidering the marginal frequencies of a selected subset of other attributes. We show that the framework pro-duces natural notions of similarity.

Expressed in terms of dissimilarities, and assuming a simple, linear function between dissimilarities and distances, the triangle inequality constraint implies that human behaviour should be consistent with Dissimilarity (A,B) + Dissimilarity (B,C) ≥ Dissimilarity (A,C), where A, B, and C are any three stimuli.

limiting similarity hypothesis,19571817,Constraints on similarity as a constraint on induction.,,"Lassaline, Mary Elizabeth",1994,"For psychologists, the problem of induction has to do with distinguishing between generalizations people are likely to make and those that they are not. Similarity, an important construct in categorization, analogy, and problem solving, has been proposed as a constraint on induction. Feature models have been used to define the role played by similarity in influencing inductive inference. This thesis focuses on similarity of relational structure as an inductive constraint, as well as on overlap of features, which has been the focus of much previous work on the role of similarity in induction. In Experiment 1, inductive inferences were more likely to the extent that two concepts shared commonalities, and were less likely to the extent that concepts had differences. These results are consistent with predictions of feature models of similarity. Using novel concepts as stimuli, subjects either (1) rated the probability of conclusions for arguments that varied in the number of commonalities and differences between concepts contained in the premise, or (2) rated the similarity of the same set of concepts. Both likelihood judgments and similarity ratings increased with the number of commonalities between the two concepts. Experiments 2-4 evaluated a structural view of similarity that distinguishes between attributes and relations as an inductive constraint. This distinction is not made by feature models of similarity. In these experiments, similarity was decomposed into attributes and relations. Results show that for a relation to influence the perceived similarity between base and target concepts, it must be shared. Conversely, for a relation to influence the inductive strength of an argument, it must connect an attribute shared by the base and target concepts to the attribute being mapped from base to target. In other words, shared attributes and relations matter for similarity; shared attributes and the connectivity of mapped to shared features matters for induction. Experiments 5-7 extended results of Experiment 2-4, which used a causal relation, to arguments involving a relation of developmental precedence. A final experiment generalized results of earlier studies to familiar natural categories.PhDPsychologyUniversity of Michigan, Horace H.

An Analysis of Some Well-Known Similarity Measures,,"Eck, Nees Jan, Waltman, Ludo",2009,"textabstractIn scientometric research, the use of co-occurrence data is very common. In many cases, a similarity measure is employed to normalize the data. However, there is no consensus among researchers on which similarity measure is most appropriate for normalization purposes. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the properties of similarity measures for co-occurrence data, focusing in particular on four well-known measures: the association strength, the cosine, the inclusion index, and the Jaccard index. We also study the behavior of these measures empirically. Our analysis reveals that there exist two fundamentally different types of similarity measures, namely set-theoretic measures and probabilistic measures. The association strength is a probabilistic measure, while the cosine, the inclusion index, and the Jaccard index are set-theoretic measures. Both our theoretical and our empirical results indicate that co-occurrence data can best be normalized using a probabilistic measure. This provides strong support for the use of the association strength in scientometric research",,info:eu-repo/semantics/workingpaper,,,Erasmus Research Institute of Management
limiting similarity hypothesis,103419099,Clustering by Pattern Similarity,,"Haixun Wang (王海勋, Jian Pei 裴 健",2007,"Abstract The task of clustering is to identify classes of similar objects among a set of objects. The definition of similarity varies from one clustering model to another. However, in most of these models the concept of similarity is often based on such metrics as Manhattan distance, Euclidean distance or other Lp distances. In other words, similar objects must have close values in at least a set of dimensions. In this paper, we explore a more general type of similarity. Under the pCluster model we proposed, two objects are similar if they exhibit a coherent pattern on a subset of dimensions. The new similarity concept models a wide range of applications. For instance, in DNA microarray analysis, the expression levels of two genes may rise and fall synchronously in response to a set of environmental stimuli. Although the magnitude of their expression levels may not be close, the patterns they exhibit can be very much alike. Discovery of such clusters of genes is essential in revealing significant connections in gene regulatory networks. E-commerce applications, such as collaborative filtering, can also benefit from the new model, because it is able to capture not only the closeness of values of certain leading indicators but also the closeness of (purchasing, browsing, etc.) patterns exhibited by the customers. In addition to the novel similarity model, this paper also introduces an effective and efficient algorithm to detect such clusters, and we perform tests on several real and synthetic data sets to show its performance",,text,clustering,,
limiting similarity hypothesis,105782705,Similarity by composition,,"Oren Boiman, Michal Irani",2007,"We propose a new approach for measuring similarity between two signals, which is applicable to many machine learning tasks, and to many signal types. We say that a signal S1 is “similar ” to a signal S2 if it is “easy ” to compose S1 from few large contiguous chunks of S2. Obviously, if we use small enough pieces, then any signal can be composed of any other. Therefore, the larger those pieces are, the more similar S1 is to S2. This induces a local similarity score at every point in the signal, based on the size of its supported surrounding region. These local scores can in turn be accumulated in a principled information-theoretic way into a global similarity score of the entire S1 to S2. “Similarity by Composition ” can be applied between pairs of signals, between groups of signals, and also between dif-ferent portions of the same signal. It can therefore be employed in a wide variety of machine learning problems (clustering, classification, retrieval, segmentation, attention, saliency, labelling, etc.), and can be applied to a wide range of signal types (images, video, audio, biological data, etc.) We show a few such examples.

INTRODUCTION The goal of this paper is to describe a multidimensioal theory of similarity and to show how estimates of the model parameters assumed to be involved in making similarity judgments can be obtained. From the viewpoint of a mathematical model, mental representations of physical objects (or their analogous in lower organisms) can be treated as n-dimensional vectors with particular distributional properties and multidimensional parameters.

Hefner (1958) extended Thurstone’s ideas to the multivariate case in which the psychological magnitudes are represented as n-dimensional random vectors, where the values on each dimension have been drawn at random from independent normal distributions of equal variance. This means that the variances across dimen- sions are equal, but that the variances for different stimuli may not be. Techniques to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the location and variability parameters of Hefner’s model have been developed by Zinnes and MacKay (1983, 1987). Choice probabilities are not monotonically related to the distances between the means of the distributions under the assumptions of the Hefner model, when variances between stimulus points are unequal. MacKay (1987) has extended the model to cases in which the psychological variance on each dimension may be unequal for each stimulus. Ashby and Perrin (1988) proposed a multidimensional version of signal detection theory in an attempt to find a common theoretical basis for similarity and recogni- tion (identification). In this approach, the probability of confusing one stimulus object with another depends on the degree of overlap of the representational dis- tributions. For a given momentary value there are particular probabilities that the variate was drawn at random from either of the two distributions of interest and the subject’s identification decision will depend on the ratio of these two probabilities. This model does not involve a distance-based similarity function. De Soete, Carroll, and DeSarbo (1986) described an unfolding model, the wandering ideal point (WIP) model, for paired comparisons data. Their model dif- fers from Hefner’s in that the values corresponding to the stimuli are fixed, only the ideal points have multivariate normal distributions, and the variance-covariance matrix of the ideal point distribution need not be an identity matrix. In the WIP model it is assumed that a subject will prefer one stimulus object over another whenever the momentary Euclidean distance between the preferred stimulus and the (wandering) ideal point is smaller than the equivalent distance for the non- preferred stimulus. This model appears to have much in common with a Thurstonian variant of Torgerson’s method of triads (Ennis, Mullen, & Frijters, 1988). In Torgerson’s method of triads, the subject’s task is to decide which of two stimuli is most like a third preselected stimulus. This third stimulus could be replaced by the ideal point from the WIP model. The stimuli evoke psychological magnitudes which are assumed to be modelled as if they were drawn from inde- pendent normal distributions. In the Thurstonian variant of Torgerson’s method of triads, iPjk represents the probability that stimulus Si will be perceived to be more similar to Sj than S,. If S; is replaced by the subject’s ideal point, then ,Pjk is the probability that S, will be preferred to S,. This preference model is more general than the WIP model because the momentary psychological magnitudes evoked by the stimuli are not fixed. However, Ennis, Mullen, and Frijters (1988) only presented the unidimensional model for Torgerson’s method of triads. An attempt to find a multidimensional extension of Torgerson’s method of triads might usefully begin with a multidimensional model for the duo-trio method (Ennis MULTIDIMENSIONAL STOCHASTIC THEORY OF SIMILARITY 451 & Mullen, 1986b; Mullen and Ennis, 1987; Mullen, Ennis, de Doncker, & Kapenga, 1988) which is itself a special case of the Thurstonian variant of Torgerson’s method of triads. The duo-trio method involves three stimuli, two of which are physicochemically identical. The subject’s task is to decide which of two (possibly) different stimuli is most like a third preselected stimulus. It is assumed that the momentary psychological magnitudes corresponding to the three stimuli have been drawn from multivariate normal distributions (two independently drawn from one distribution, the third from a possibly different distribution). Another tri-stimulus grouping technique, the triangular method (in which the subject’s task is to select the most different stimulus), has also been modelled under distributional assump- tions similar to the duo-trio method (Ennis & Mullen, 1986b, Mullen & Ennis, 1987; Kapenga, de Doncker, Mullen, & Ennis, 1987). In this paper, we extend the mathematical models developed for grouping techniques to same-different judgments and identification performance. This is accomplished by defining an explicit distance-based similarity function from which the expected value of similarity for confusable stimuli can be computed. We then show how the multivariate psychological parameters corresponding to a selection of hypothetical and real objects can be obtained. A MULTIDIMENSIONAL THEORY OF SIMILARITY Assumptions Consider the case of a single pair of stimulus objects, S, and S,., which give rise to momentary psychological values of the respective magnitudes x and y where x’ = (x, ) x2, . ..) x,), y’= (Yl, Y,,  ...? y,); x’ indicates an n-dimensional row vector and n is the number of psychological dimensions. The momentary psychological values are mutually independently distributed with x having density function h(x) and y having density function h(y). The probability densities h(x) and h(y) are mul- tivariate normal distributions with means u, and p, and variancecovariance matrices V, and V,.. On the basis of the momentary psychological values, x and y, the subject decides whether the stimuli are the same or different. Let z =x - y. Let d represent the momentary distance between x and y perceived by the subject, where Ily d= i 1.~~1~ , ~31. [ 1 k=l The distance between population means is 452 ENNIS, PALEN, AND MULLEN Let the similarity of two particular momentary psychological values be g(d). The form of g specifies the similarity function, or the function relating similarity to distance. If the subject invokes a step function, g(d) will be 0 or 1 depending on the value of d relative to some threshold value. If the subject invokes a continuous function, then g(d) will be a value that may be different from 0 or 1. If g is con- tinuous, g(d) should decrease as d increases. Continuous and step functions will be considered for g. The Continuous Function There are many different functional forms which could be proposed for the function, g. Shepard (1987) argued in favor of an exponential decay similarity func- tion. A flexible function which includes the exponential decay function is g(d) = exp( -d”L a z 0. In order to satisfy the earlier stated requirement that g(d) should decrease as d increases, c( must be 20 or g(d) would become larger as d became larger. The particular value for a may be different for different subjects and experimental conditions, although it is conceivable that c1 may be a constant. V is the variancecovariance matrix of the difference between psychological values, z. p is a vector of differences between the means of the momentary psychological values, c ‘i and p,.. The probability of declaring two randomly sampled psychological values from h(x) and h(y) to be the “same” is the expected value of g (in the absence of response bias), or f(p, v, 6 Y)=1‘* y -1 Ix exp{-OS(z-p)‘V’(z-p)} ~ cc ~ x 02 (2x)42 JVJ li2 xexp(-d”)dz, dz,...dz,, (1) wheref(p, V, a, y) represents the expected value of the similarity of the two objects. Equation (1) can be evaluated numerically for any tl and y (which defines the metric of d), but can be simplified significantly for the case when c1= 2 and y = 2. For this case, (2) where J=V ‘+21 and I is the identity matrix. A proof of Eq. (2) is given in the Appendix. MULTIDIMENSIONAL STOCHASTIC THEORY OF SIMILARITY 453 The Step Function Conceptually, the step function can be handled in a way similar to that of the continuous function, except that g(d) is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of d relative to a threshold value, t. If g(d) = 0.5 { sgn(r - d) + I}, where sgn is the Signum function, then g(d) will be 0 when d> r (stimuli are different) and 1 when d< T (stimuli are the same). The formula for calculatingf(p, V, T) is xOS(sgn(r-d)+ l;dz, dz,...dz,,. (3) T may be a fixed value or may be drawn from a particular probability density function and vary from trial to trial. In the examples given later, however, we consider T to be fixed. Identlyication and Categorization Models Identification and categorization performance models, such as those discussed by Nosofsky (19&S), based on Shepard’s (1957) work, could be extended to deal with stimuli whose psychological magnitudes may vary from trial to trial by formulating the models in terms of expected values. For instance, in the case of identification performance, P(R,) Sj) = E bj g(dq) Ckm= 1 b/cd&) 1 ’ where P(R, 1 S;) is the probability that stimulus Si leads to response R,; bj and 6, are response bias parameters, 0 d b, < 1; m is the number of stimuli; and g(d,) is the similarity function evaluated at d,. According to this formulation of identification decisions, the subject obtains a distance-based similarity value on each trial for the stimulus in question (Si) and each of the memory representations of the m stimuli. The terms in the denominator may not be independent if, for instance, the subject uses the same momentary psychological magnitude corresponding to Si in deter- mining each of the d,, (k = I, . . . . m). On the other hand, before obtaining similarity values [g(dik)] for Si and each of the m memory representations, the subject may obtain different psychological magnitudes corresponding to Si (i.e., resampling the stimulus distribution before referring to each memory representation). The model given by Nosofsky (1986) for categorization can be similarly formulated. These stochastic extensions of identification and categorization models will require more study and elaboration and will not be pursued further here. 454 ENNIS, PALEN, AND MULLEN EVALUATION OF CONTINUOUS AND STEP SIMILARITY FUNCTIONS Computing Equations (1 ), (2), and (3) were evaluated on a Gould 32/97 computer. Equa- tions ( 1) and (3) were handled numerically using an adaptive routine by Genz and Malik (1980) in the bivariate case. These results agreed to third decimal place accuracy with Monte Carlo simulations of 100,000 trials per estimate. When n, the number of dimensions, is equal to 2, v= 0: + CT: Plala2+p203a4 ~l”la2+ha3a4 I o:+o: ’ where cr: and D: are the variances of the distributions from which x1 and x2 were drawn, respectively; e: and ai are the variances of the distributions from which y, and y2 were drawn, respectively; p1 is the correlation coefficient between the dimen- sions of h(x) and p2 is the correlation coefficient between the dimensions of h(y). Similarity Functions and Distance Metrics Shepard (1987) proposed the basis for a law of generalization involving the following two ideas: first, that the probability that a response learned to stimulus Si will be made to stimulus Sj is approximately an exponential decay function of the distance between the stimuli in a space of a certain dimensionality; second, that the metric used to define this distance will be Euclidean when the psychological dimen- sions are integral and city-block when they are separable. Shepard noted that the theory applied only to experiments in which generalization is tested immediately after a single learning trial with a novel stimulus. Shepard pointed out that with highly similar stimuli or with delayed test stimuli, the relationship between similarity and distance was of a Gaussian form and that the distance metric appeared to be Euclidean for cases in which the theory would predict city-block. The work of Nosofsky (1986) exemplifies this kind of result. Using highly similar stimui, Nosofsky (1986) discussed identification and classification performance and used a “Gaussian” function in modelling the relationship between the Euclidean distance separating the stimulus points and similarity. With regard to Nosofsky’s results, Shepard conjectured that internal noise may make “the otherwise sharply peaked gradient of generalization . . . more nearly Gaussian.” There were two distances defined earlier under the assumptions for the similarity model. The distance between momentary trial psychological magnitudes was represented by d, while the distance between the means of the distributions of psy- chological magnitudes was 6. Nosofsky and Shepard define the distance between the points representing the stimuli without psychological error and, consequently, treat distance in a deterministic manner. This concept of distance corresponds better to 6 than it does to d, since it is not expected to vary from trial to trial. When modelling the relationship between 6 and f(p, V), it is instructive to consider, for a particular similarity function and metric (c( and y), the effect of the MULTIDIMENSIONAL STOCHASTIC THEORY OF SIMILARITY 455 1. 0 =I 2’ iI =a 08 3. n =3 06 0 I I 1 I 1 I 0 0.2 04 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 14 1.6 1.8 ri 2 EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE ( d 1 FIG.

For all of the points in these figures, it was assumed that Q, = (r2 = D) = IY~ = 0.2 (equal variance on all dimensions for all stimuli) and that p, = p2 = 0.0 (separable dimension stimuli). [Note that, for these parameters, the relative orien- tation of the stimulus means to each other will not affectf(p, V) when the similarity function involves a Euclidean distance metric; but when the city-block metric is assumed, it will.] These figures suggest, qualitatively consistent with Nosofsky’s findings, that a modified Gaussian function relating f(r, V) and 6 should be expected, even if the similarity function is an exponential decay function and the metric defining d (within-trial distance) is city-block.

MULTIDIMENSIONAL STOCHASTIC THEORY OF SIMILARITY 457 within each trial and that the city-block distance metric is also employed (y = 1). Consider 16 stimuli whose momentary psychological magnitudes can be represented mentally by independent multivariate normal distributions with means (0, 0), (0.8, 1.2), (0.3, 0.7), (0.9, Ll), (1.2, 0.6), (0.8, 0.8), (0.1, OS), (0.3, O.O), (0.7, O.l), (1.1, l.O), (0.9, 0.6), (0.6, 0.6) (0.4, 0.4), (0.2, 1.2), (0.9, O.l), (0.7,0.7); variances (0.2,0.2) for all stimuli; and correlation coefficients of zero between dimensions for all stimuli. Imagine that the experimenter knows the location parameters (means) for each stimulus so that the distance between means (Euclidean and city-block metrics) can be computed. From Eq. (1) one can obtain the expected similarity value for each pair of stimuli assuming that CI = 1 and y = 1 within each trial. It is interesting to inquire about the relationship between 6 (the distance between population means) andf(p, V) (the expected value of similarity). Figures 3a and 3b show this relationship for this set of 16 coordinates in two dimensions. Given the modified Gaussian form of these figures, it seems reasonable to attempt to lit a linear function relating ln[f(p, V)] and 6* to the data for both metric forms of 6. Such a linear regression analysis suggests that the Euclidean metric leads to a fit of the data (r* = .98) which is at least as good as the city-block metric (r* = .95). This conclusion might also be reached by simple inspection of the figures. Qualitatively, at least, one can conclude that the distance metric appropriate to the function relat- ing distance to the expected value of the similarity of pairs of stimuli, evoking separable dimension representations, may be different from the metric employed by subjects within individual trials. It is possible, consequently, to reconcile Nosofsky’s findings with those of Shepard’s regarding the form of the metric provided that ~a~=a~:cr~=a~~1.0,p,=p,~O.o,r~2.0 '\ Oa .,@ Oa:=~~=~~32.~.1.0,p,.pZ.0.0,T=2.5 '.....& @a: = CT;= + flj'=l.O, p,=p2 :o.o,T'3.0 SlMlL4Wl-Y 0 2 4 6 0 10 EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE ( 6 ) FIG. 4. Expected value of similarity as a function of the Euclidean distance between the means of the distributions of psychological magnitudes for different values of T when a step judgment function is assumed. 458 ENNIS, PALEN, AND MULLEN Shepard’s theory concerning the similarity function and the metric is applied within trials for confusable stimuli. Specific comments on Nosofsky (1986) and Shepard (1986, 1987) have been made (Ennis, 1988a, 1988b). The Step Function Figure 4 shows the relationship between 6 and f(n V) for step functions where r is 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 and where equal variances of 1.0 and correlation coefficients of 0.0 are assumed. In order to produce self-similarity values (6 = 0.0) in the 0.84.9 range, r should be between about 2.0 and 3.0 for this case. Although the step func- tion model will make differential predictions for varying values of the stochastic parameters, it is quite limited compared to the continuous form of g. The only way to manipulate the rate of decrease off(p, V) as a function of 6 for a given V matrix, for instance, is to change r. This will also have the effect of changing the predicted probability of declaring identical objects “same.” STOCHASTIC MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING Assuming that c1 and y are given, we have shown how the expected value of similarity is a function of the difference between the means of the distributions of psychological magnitudes (cc) and the variancecovariance matrix of the difference between psychological values (V). It should, therefore, be possible to estimate the means and variancecovariance matrices of the psychological magnitudes corres- ponding to a selection of objects. For the case c1= 2 and y = 2, the means and standard errors for 36 stimuli in two dimensions were sampled at random from dis- tributions that yielded values off@, V) in the range 0.5-1.0. One of the stimuli was assigned the mean (0,O). All correlation coefficients were assigned the value 0.0. The matrix of 666 similarity values (all stimulus pairs including self-comparisons) was obtained by solving Eq. (2) for the selected means and standard errors. A modified Levenberg-Marquardt (steepest descent) algorithm was used to obtain multidimensional parameter values for which the difference between the similarities corresponding to the parameters obtained and the input similarities was minimum in a least-squares sense. Let a be a vector containing the parameters to be estimated. These are the estimates of the means and standard errors of the distributions of interest. From a, it is simple to compute pii and V, (the means of differences and variance+ovariance matrix of differences for stimuli Sj and S,) and, consequently, f(pii, VU) can then be computed from Eq. (2). The function to be minimized is qb)=CC [pii-f(p,,,V,)12, j<i, where P, is the observed probability of declaring Si and Sj to be “same.” A key to solving this problem and avoiding local minima is the generation of good initial starting values. MULTIDIMENSIONAL STOCHASTIC THEORY OF SIMILARITY 459 The analysis was initiated with randomly generated values of the means and assuming that all standard errors were 0.2 and that correlation coefficients were 0.0. The value of 0.2 for the standard errors was chosen because this value yields a self- similarity value of about 0.85, which roughly corresponded to the average diagonal value of the samedifferent matrix. The parameter values at this minimum were then used as the starting configuration for a second stage in which all standard errors were assumed to be equal across dimensions for a particular stimulus, but may vary across stimuli. The configuration at the minimum from stage 2 was used as the starting configuration for the final stage in which the standard errors may vary across both stimuli and dimensions. The results of this analysis are given in Table 1. This table shows the means and standard errors of the original configuration of 36 points and their corresponding estimates. These estimates differ only slightly in the third decimal place from the actual values, supporting the validity of the strategy used to reach the minimum. The residual sum of squares at this minimum was <O.OOl. An attempt to estimate all of the parameters in one stage failed to recover the original configuration. It is interesting to note that the results reported in Table 1 were obtained without rota- tion of the estimated configuration and are a mirror image of the original con- figuration. This orientational uniqueness is a consequence of variance inequality. The ability to directly interpret the results of a multidimensional scaling analysis without the arbitrariness introduced by rotation should prove useful in identifying the dimensions employed by subjects when comparing stimulus objects. Differences between pairs of identical stimuli obtained from same-different judgments can be viewed as a consequence of differences in variances on one or more of the dimensions involved in the decision process. Ashby and Perrin (1988) have discussed this kind of interpretation of self-similarity. There may also be differences in self-similarity due to different numbers of psychological dimensions involved in the judgment. Krumhansl (1978) proposed a spatial density model to explain differences in self-similarity and asymmetrical similarities. Alternatively, it may be possible to formulate the effects of spatial density in terms of variance differences. Psychological magnitudes obtained from means located in a densely populated region of the space may have been sampled from distributions with higher variance than those located in a less densely populated area. Consequently, self-similarity measured in terms off(p, V) would be lower in dense regions than in sparse regions. This hypothesis was supported by a reanalysis of the Rothkopf (1957) Morse code same-different matrix, as can be seen in Fig. 5. Using the parameter estimation procedure described earlier for the artificial data set, means and variances for the Rothkopf data were obtained assuming that c1= 2 and y = 2. Solutions in which it was assumed that the variances across dimensions for a particular stimulus were equal and unequal were obtained. The unequal variance model gave a slightly lower residual sum of squares than the equal variance model, but the configurations of means for the stimuli were almost identical. For convenience in comparing the relative variances of the stimuli, the equal variance model was used. Figure 5 shows that the size of the standard error for a stimulus 480’32%X 460 ENNIS, PALEN, AND MULLEN TABLE 1 Actual Means and Standard Errors for 36 Stimuli and Their Estimates Obtained Using Nonlinear Least-Squares Minimization Means Dimension 1 Dimension 2 (1) (2) (1) (2) - 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.152 0.154 0.253 - 0.046 -0.046 -0.235 0.234 0.182 0.184 0.240 0.059 0.059 0.149 -0.149 0.190 0.192 0.150 0.361 0.361 0.105 -0.105 0.679 0.680 0.236 -0.102 -0.103 -0.039 0.039 0.213 0.215 0.382 0.000 0.000 - 0.224 0.224 0.216 0.218 0.240 -0.041 -0.041 -0.113 0.113 0.238 0.240 0.211 -0.093 - 0.094 -0.100 0.100 0.237 0.238 0.425 -0.314 -0.314 0.117 -0.117 0.227 0.229 0.162 -0.405 - 0.406 0.296 -0.295 0.286 0.288 0.173 0.144 0.144 0.101 -0.100 0.160 0.162 0.392 - 0.023 - 0.023 0.142 -0.142 0.231 0.233 0.152 -0.194 -0.194 0.111 -0.111 0.150 0.153 0.170 -0.106 -0.106 -0.119 0.119 0.158 0.160 0.179 -0.281 -0.282 -0.250 0.250 0.150 0.153 0.177 0.146 0.147 -0.096 0.096 0.298 0.300 0.151 0.140 0.141 0.278 - 0.277 0.155 0.157 0.154 0.521 0.521 -0.138 0.138 0.150 0.153 0.217 0.095 0.096 -0.035 0.035 0.465 0.467 0.235 0.108 0.108 -0.047 0.047 0.168 0.170 0.164 -0.179 -0.179 -0.405 0.405 0.588 0.590 0.186 -0.047 -0.047 0.022 - 0.022 0.330 0.332 0.272 -0.142 -0.143 0.032 -0.032 0.224 0.226 0.254 - 0.099 -0.100 0.072 -0.072 0.155 0.158 0.181 - 0.077 -0.77 - 0.034 0.034 0.150 0.152 0.620 0.124 0.124 0.206 - 0.206 0.267 0.268 0.151 0.270 0.271 -0.154 0.154 0.155 0.158 0.210 -0.268 - 0.269 0.218 -0.218 0.210 0.212 0.266 0.205 0.206 0.012 -0.012 0.161 0.164 0.695 0.282 0.282 -0.261 0.261 0.172 0.175 0.160 0.369 0.369 0.023 - 0.023 0.171 0.174 0.152 -0.025 -0.025 0.013 -0.013 0.559 0.561 0.156 - 0.329 - 0.329 0.068 -0.068 0.238 0.240 0.293 -0.127 -0.128 0.151 -0.150 0.179 0.182 0.181 -0.101 -0.101 - 0.090 0.090 0.167 0.169 0.157 -0.368 -0.368 0.207 - 0.207 0.162 0.165 0.160 Standard errors Dimension 1 Dimension 2 (1) (2) (1) - (2) 0.251 0.238 0.148 0.235 0.381 0.238 0.209 0.424 0.160 0.170 0.390 0.149 0.168 0.177 0.174 0.149 0.151 0.215 0.233 0.162 0.183 0.271 0.252 0.179 0.619 0.149 0.208 0.262 0.693 0.158 0.150 0.154 0.291 0.179 0.155 0.158 Note.

The standard error on either dimension for 36 Morse code signals plotted in relation to the average Euclidean distance between each stimulus mean and the 35 other stimulus means. distribution is related to the degree to which that stimulus is isolated from the other stimuli in the set under study (measured by the average Euclidean distance between a stimulus and all the other stimuli). Shepard (1963) had applied nonmetric multi- dimensional scaling to the same Rothkopf matrix and obtained a configuration of perceived Morse code signals. The configuration of means obtained using stochastic multidimensional scaling was quite similar to Shepard’s configuration and would certainly have led to the same interpretation of the dimensions (number of signal components and the dots/dashes ratio). This result is not that surprising for this matrix because many of the samedifferent judgment probabilities were less than 0.5 suggesting, in the absence of response bias, that many pairs of signals were not highly confusable. Notwithstanding these comments, this data set proved useful in showing that some stimuli may be more precisely perceived than others and that this precision may depend on the location of a stimulus relative to the others in the data set. Variance differences between stimuli may explain differences in self- similarity. It would be interesting to analyse a matrix of same-different judgments obtained from more highly confusable objects than the Morse code signals. When a = 2 and y = 2 it is possible to estimate the parameters of a sample problem rapidly without the need to use the much slower numerical methods to evaluate Eq. (1). To include a and y as parameters to be estimated is possible, but would require extensive numerical evaluation of Eq. (l), leading to a several hundred-fold increase in computation time, depending on the desired accuracy of the numerical analysis. A closed form for the special case a = 2, y  = 2 is given in Eq. (2) and it would be very useful to have a similar algebraic form when a = 1, y = 1. This is important because the city-block metric and the exponential decay function may be universally inherent in similarity judgments and identification deci- sions with separable dimension stimuli. In considering the similarity function, g, we have restricted ourselves to a par- ticular form, exp( -d”). If g were defined as any monotonically decreasing function of 4 then it can be seen that nonmetric multidimensional scaling would be a special 462 ENNIS, PALEN, AND MULLEN case of the more general approach described here, but in which variances are assumed to be zero. CONCLUSION A multidimensional model of similarity has be described which involves a distance-based similarity function and an assumed distribution of momentary psychological magnitudes from which the distance is derived. Evaluation of the same-different judgment model shows that it is possible to produce a modified Gaussian function relating similarity to the distance between the means of the dis- tributions of psychological magnitudes even if the within-trial similarity function is an exponential decay function. Nosofsky’s findings regarding the form of the metric (Euclidean) for a particular set of confusable stimuli is consistent with Shepard’s theory that the appropriate metric is city-block for separable stimuli, provided Shepard’s theory is applied at the individual trial level. Using a nonlinear least-squares procedure, it is shown how the parameters of a sample problem may be estimated from a matrix of hypothetical samedifferent judgments. Because of uniqueness introduced by unequal variances, where such variances exist, the multidimensional scaling analysis yields a solution configuration that does not require rotation to interpret the psychological dimensions used by the subject. Assuming that the judgment function is any monotonically decreasing func- tion of the distance between the momentary within-trial psychological magnitudes, the stochastic multidimensional scaling procedure described in this paper is a general case which includes deterministic approaches, such as nonmetric multi- dimensional scaling, as special cases. APPENDIX The momentary psychological values are x and y where x’ = (x,, x2, . . . . xn), y’ = .(YlY Y2> . . .Y y,); x’ indicates an n-dimensional row vector and n is the number of sensory dimensions. The momentary psychological values are mutually independ- ently distributed with x having density function h(x) and y having density function h(y). The probability densities h(x) and h(y) are multivariate normal distributions with means P, and I+ where r: = (P.~~, ILL, . . . . P,,) and I$ = (P.~, , py2, . . . . Pi,), and variance-covariance matrices V, and V,. On the basis of the momentary psychological values, x and y, the subject decides whether the stimuli are the same or different. Let z = x - y and d represent the momentary distance between x and y perceived by the subject, where r n MULTIDIMENSIONAL STOCHASTIC THEORY OF SIMILARITY 463 V is the variance-covariance matrix of the difference between psychological values, z. c is a vector of differences between the means of the momentary psychological values, p-v and pc.. The expected value of similarity, in the absence of response bias, is f(p, V, CI, y).

Similarity and metric learning methods learn such measures automatically from data, but they do not scale well re-spect to the dimensionality of the data. In this paper, we propose a method that can learn efficiently similarity measure from high-dimensional sparse data. The core idea is to parameterize the similarity measure as a con-vex combination of rank-one matrices with specific sparsity structures. The parame-ters are then optimized with an approximate Frank-Wolfe procedure to maximally satisfy relative similarity constraints on the train-ing data. Our algorithm greedily incorpo-rates one pair of features at a time into the similarity measure, providing an efficient way to control the number of active features and thus reduce overfitting. It enjoys very ap-pealing convergence guarantees and its time and memory complexity depends on the spar-sity of the data instead of the dimension of the feature space. Our experiments on real-world high-dimensional datasets demonstrate its potential for classification, dimensionality reduction and data exploration. ",,text,,,

However, these methods are subject to the curse of dimensionality: as the number of features grows large, poor generalization is to be expected and training becomes intractable due to high computational and memory costs. In this paper, we propose a similarity learning method that can efficiently deal with high-dimensional sparse data. This is achieved through a parameterization of similarity functions by convex combinations of sparse rank-one matrices, together with the use of a greedy approximate Frank-Wolfe algorithm which provides an efficient way to control the number of active features. We show that the convergence rate of the algorithm, as well as its time and memory complexity, are independent of the data dimension. We further provide a theoretical justification of our modeling choices through an analysis of the generalization error, which depends logarithmically on the sparsity of the solution rather than on the number of features.

The SNN architecture guarantees the basic properties of a similarity measure (symmetry and non negativity) and it can deal with non-transitivity of the similarity criterion. Unlike the majority of the metric learning algorithms proposed so far, it can model non-linear relationships among data still providing a natural out-of-sample extension to novel pairs of patterns. The theoretical properties of SNNs and their application to Semi-Supervised Clustering are investigated. In particular, we introduce a novel technique that allows the clustering algorithm to compute the optimal representatives of a data partition by means of backpropagation on the input layer, biased by a L2 norm regularizer.

limiting similarity hypothesis,210960016,Statistical Learning with Similarity and Dissimilarity Functions,,"von Luxburg, U.",2004,"This work explores statistical properties of machine learning algorithms from different perspectives. Questions arising both in the fields of supervised and unsupervised learning, dealing with diverse issues such as the convergence of algorithms, the speed of convergence, generalization bounds, and how statistical properties can be used in practical machine learning applications are investigated. All topics covered have the common feature that the properties of the similarity or dissimilarity function on the data play an important role. Learning is the process of inferring general rules from given examples. The examples are instances of some input space (pattern space), and the rules can consist of some general observation about the structure of the input space, or have the form of a functional dependancy between the input and some output space. Two types of learning problems are considered: classification and clustering. In both problems, the goal is to divide the input space into several regions such that objects within the same region """"belong together"""" and """"are different"""" from the objects in the other regions. The difference between the two problems is that classification is a supervised learning technique while clustering is unsupervised. Machine learning algorithms are usually designed to deal with either similarities or dissimilarities. In general it is recommended to close an algorithm which can deal with the type of data given, but sometimes it may become necessary to convert similarities into dissimilarities or vice versa. In some situations this can be done without loosing information, especially if the similarities and distances are defined by a scalar product in an Euclidean space. If this is not the case, several heuristics can be invoked. The general idea is to transform a similarity into a dissimilarity function or vice versa by applying a monotonically decreasing function. This is according to the general intuition that a distance is small if the similarity is large, and vice versa. The connection between information theory and learning can be exploited in every-day machine learning applications",,info:eu-repo/semantics/book,,,'Logos Verlag Berlin'

Given a set of objects and their correlations, we here rely on the premise that each object is characterized by its context, i.e. its correlations to the other objects. The similarity between two objects can then be expressed in terms of the similarity between their contexts. In this way, similarity pertains to the general notion that objects are similar if they are exchangeable in the data. We propose a scalable approach for calculating all relevant similarities among objects by relating them in a correlation graph that is transformed to a similarity graph. These graphs can express rich structural properties among objects. Specifically, we show that concepts - abstractions of objects - are constituted by groups of similar objects that can be discovered by clustering the objects in the similarity graph.

However, the factors underlying weapon diversity among species remain poorly understood, and a fundamental hypothesis to explain this diversity remains untested. Although weapons can serve multiple functions, an undeniably important function is their role in fights. Thus, a crucial hypothesis is that weapon diversification is driven by the evolution of weapon modifications that provide an advantage in combat (e.g. causing more damage). Here, we test this fighting-advantage hypothesis using data from 17 species of coreid bugs. We utilize the fact that male-male combat in coreids often results in detectable damage, allowing us to link different weapon morphologies to different levels of damage among species. We find that certain weapon morphologies inflict much more damage than others, strongly supporting the fighting-advantage hypothesis. Moreover, very different weapon morphologies can inflict similarly severe amounts of damage, leading to a weapon performance landscape with multiple performance peaks. This multi-peak pattern could potentially drive different lineages towards divergent weapon forms, further increasing weapon diversity among species. Overall, our results may help explain how sexually selected weapons have evolved into the diversity of forms seen today.12 month embargo; published: 27 January 2021This item from the UA Faculty Publications collection is made available by the University of Arizona with support from the University of Arizona Libraries.

novel weapons hypothesis,151317065,Tangled up in Khaki and Blue: Lethal and Non-Lethal Weapons in Recent Confrontations,,"Koplow, David A.",2005,"Too often, military and law enforcement authorities have found themselves constrained by inadequate weaponry: the tools available to them, in addressing confrontations with entrenched opponents of various sorts, are either too weak (not sufficing to disarm or defeat the enemy) or too strong (generating unacceptable  collateral damage  in harming innocent people or property). An emerging category of  non-lethal weapons  carries promise for resolving this dilemma, proffering deft new capabilities for disabling, dissuading, or defeating opponents without inflicting death or permanent injury. Some primitive non-lethal weapons (such as truncheons, tear gas, and water cannon) have long been staples in the inventories of police and military forces in the United States and other countries. More sophisticated options (e.g., electronic stun guns or pepper spray) are becoming more common and are increasingly employed in a variety of law enforcement and security situations. Most dramatically, an array of much more sophisticated technologies (including directed energy beams, calmative chemicals, and foam sprays that seal buildings or make an area impassively slippery) are being developed, and could emerge for use by soldiers and police in the near future. These augmented capabilities carry both immense promise and grave risks: they expand the power of law enforcement and military units, enabling them to accomplish assigned missions with greater finesse and reduced casualties. But they may also be misused, they may proliferate to malign applications, and they may inspire leaders to over-rely upon a myth of  bloodless combat.  This article explores the emerging world of non-lethal weapons by examining a series of case studies--recent real-world scenarios from three diverse confrontations around the world in which the availability of a modern arsenal of non-lethal weapons might have made a difference, enabling a more successful outcome in the face of deeply entrenched opposition",,text,"non-lethal weapons, lethal force, armed conflict, Waco, Dubrovka Theater, Basra, Law Enforcement and Corrections, Military, War, and Peace, National Security Law",,Scholarship @ GEORGETOWN LAW
novel weapons hypothesis,480506820,Firearms and Homicide: the Influence of the Weapon Substitution Hypothesis on the American Gun Control Debate,10.26686/wgtn.16934815.v1,"Russell, Nestar John Charles (11650219)",2000,"For several decades now the gun control literature in the United States has continued to produce conflicting accounts in regards to the availability of firearms on the U.S's high rate of homicide.  This thesis proposes that this conflict is, in part, due to the implicit and continued influence of Wolfgang's (1958) 'weapon substitution hypothesis'.  Wolfgang's hypothesis proposes that the intentions of an assailant, whether they be to kill or injure, determined the weapon selected.  Since guns are recognised as being highly lethal, all assailants who use such weapons were believed by Wolfgang to have been highly determined to kill.  Among other negative effects, it is argued that Wolfgang's hypothesis introduced a mind-set to this controversial research area that has continued to influence the opinions of academics from both sides of the debate.  This mind-set revolves around the consensually held belief that if a firearm assailant is believed to have been determined to kill then they would have been capable of killing in the absence of firearms.  Importantly, this belief implies that the best possible predictor of lethal weapon substitution is if a firearm assailant is determined to kill.  This is unlikely to be true.   Mischel (1968: 135) has argued: 'A person's relevant past behaviours tend to be the best predictors of his future behaviour in similar situations.'  After adapting Mischel's logic to fit the weapon substitution debate, the following predictor was produced.  The best possible predictor of lethal weapon substitution to non-firearm weapons is whether people who had killed with firearms were as experienced at killing victims with non-firearm weapons as assailants who had actually killed with such weapons.  This predictor was further developed into a more workable methodology that was capable of testing the validity of both Wolfgang's hypothesis and the consensually held belief it initiated.  This methodology involved a comparison of the previous serious to fatal violent non-firearm convictions between those most likely to be determined firearm and knife killers.  It was discovered that only 2.94 percent of those most likely to be determined firearm assailants and 25.23 percent of those most likely to be determined knife assailants had previous convictions for serious to fatal non-firearm assaults.  This result was statistically significant to the p< 0.005 (Z score=2.84).  After eliminating all other possible explanations for these results it was concluded that, in conflict with both Wolfgang's hypothesis and the consensually held belief, not all determined firearm assailants are likely to be capable of lethal weapon substitution.  Furthermore, if some proportion of determined firearm assailants are unlikely to be capable of lethal weapon substitution, then those not so determined are likely to be even less capable.  Therefore, it was concluded that inhibiting all potential firearm assailants from accessing guns would be likely to reduce the overall rate of homicide.  However, this thesis was limited in being able to apply this conclusion to the United States because it was based on a New Zealand population.  Nevertheless, it is argued that the perpetuation of the consensually held belief has inhibited the best possible predictor of lethal weapon substitution from being applied to a research area where prediction is of paramount importance.  When the best possible predictor of lethal weapon substitution has not previously been applied, it therefore becomes more understandable why this research area is plagued by such controversy.</p",,"Text, Thesis","Law not elsewhere classified, Motivation, Homicide, Firearms, School: School of Social and Cultural Studies, 180199 Law not elsewhere classified, Marsden: 390401 Criminology, Degree Discipline: Criminology, Degree Level: Masters, Degree Name: Doctor of Philosophy",,'Victoria University of Wellington Library'

Hafted hunting technology represents the development of new cognitive and social learning mechanisms within the genus Homo, and may have provided a foraging advantage over simpler forms of hunting technology, such as a sharpened wooden spear. However, the nature of this foraging advantage has not been confirmed. Experimental studies and ethnographic reports provide conflicting results regarding the relative importance of the functional, economic, and social roles of hafted hunting technology. The controlled experiment reported here was designed to test the functional hypothesis for stone-tipped weapons using spears and ballistics gelatin. It differs from previous investigations of this type because it includes a quantitative analysis of wound track profiles and focuses specifically on hand-delivered spear technology. Our results do not support the hypothesis that tipped spears penetrate deeper than untipped spears. However, tipped spears create a significantly larger inner wound cavity that widens distally. This inner wound cavity is analogous to the permanent wound cavity in ballistics research, which is considered the key variable affecting the relative 'stopping power' or 'killing power' of a penetrating weapon. Tipped spears conferred a functional advantage to Middle Pleistocene hominins, potentially affecting the frequency and regularity of hunting success with important implications for human adaptation and life history",,article,"Medicine, R, Science, Q",issn:1932-6203,Public Library of Science (PLoS)

Prior to their emergence, however, less sophisticated forms of weap-onry included the sword, spear, lance, and bow. During the transition to the modern world, the longbow and crossbow, the two reigning missile weapons of the medieval era, were success-fully challenged and eventually replaced by the more advanced ﬁ rearm ﬁ rst introduced to the battleﬁ eld in the 14th century.3Early handheld ﬁ rearms looked like miniature cannons. Wooden sticks were strapped to iron pipes with one end blocked and a touch hole bored so as to ignite the crude gunpowder mixture. Glowing sticks and wires brought to the touch hole served to ﬁ re the weapon, which shooters pointed in the general direction of the target because aiming was impossible. From these humble beginnings, ﬁ re-arms evolved over the course of centuries into true handheld weapons with many recogniz-ably modern components. Gains in standoff range, accuracy, lethality, and reliability became dramatically evident as sophisti-cation increased.Firearms—then character-ized as crude and unreliable—beat out competing weapons of late medieval and early modern times because they offered potentials the other, then domi-nant, systems did not. Whereas both longbows and crossbows had exhausted their human and quasi-mechanical power sources, ﬁ rearms began to exploit the deadly force capabil-ity provided by chemical reac-tions and internal combustion. This new and advanced weapon ultimately would take down the old medieval order by shooting the knight from his horse and breeching the high walls of the lord’s castle.This end state came about by means of a gradual process. The development of the musket into the riﬂ e and the addition of the bayonet culminated in the ascendancy of the modern ﬁ rearm as the dominant system in warfare. In tandem with long-gun evolution, pistols became available for military and eventual policing functions, and siege, later ﬁ eld, artillery began to emerge on the battleﬁ eld.Transition to Laser WeaponsAs in the transition from medieval to modern weaponry, legacy systems, such as con-ventional ﬁ rearms, will not be supplanted overnight. Still, this process of weaponry evolution will not occur over centuries but in mere decades as a result of the ever-increasing pace of technological innovation.It is projected that an incre-mental process will unfold over the course of many decades as lasers, and other forms of di-rected energy weapons, emerge haphazardly as components that will augment ﬁ rearms (e.g., laser sights) and also be ﬁ elded as stand-alone systems both Chief Safety Ofﬁ cer Lindsay serves with the Ontario International Airport, as well as the Los Angeles, California, Department of Airports and its Airport Law Enforcement and Protection Services.Dr. Bunker is the CEO of a security consulting corporation in Claremont, California.66719x.indd 3   3/13/2008 12:12:33 PM    4 / FBI Law Enforcement Bulletincomplementing and challeng-ing ﬁ rearms.4 As energy sourceoutput, transmission efﬁ ciency(lessened energy loss), storage,and reliability increase, so, too,will handheld laser weaponcapability. For this reason, thisdevelopmental pattern, exceptfor its historically compressednature, will likely mimic that ofthe ﬁ rearm.Beyond offering advancedpower source exploitationpotentials over ﬁ rearms, la-sers possess several enhancedtactical and operational func-tions.5 Moreover, for policingpurposes, the most signiﬁ cant ofthese capabilities include thoseidentiﬁ ed as exploiting ﬁ fth-di-mensional operational space.6•  Speed of light: Because a la-ser beam travels at 186,000miles per second, no timeof ﬂ ight exists for it to hit atarget. As soon as the trig-ger of the laser weapon ispulled, the target has beenengaged.•  Energy concentrated on thetarget: Unlike many omni-directional munitions, allof the energy of a laser isfocused in a coherent beamupon the target. The smallerand tighter the beam, themore energy is concentratedat the point of impact.•  Straight line of ﬂ ight:No ﬁ re control is requiredto calculate a ballistictrajectory and lead.Whatever is aimed at is hit,based on a straight line ofsight and ﬂ ight.•  Extreme standoff potential:Stronger lasers have stand-off ranges in excess of mostmodern ﬁ rearms; however,beam coherence issues ariseat extreme ranges of laseremployment.which eliminates the needfor large quantities ofammunition. The only realpotentially inhibiting factoris overheating because oflong durations of use.•  Rheostat: The energy levelsproduced can be increasedand lowered, allowing forthe more tailored applicationof force. Low levels couldcause less lethal effects,while more energy emittedcould result in lethal-forceapplications.•  Frequency shifting: Tunablelasers, those with shiftingwavelengths, are highlyresistant to countermeasuresbased on ﬁ lters that blockknown threat wavelengths.•  Unique wounding: Cornealand retinal damages to theeyes may take place withlow-energy lasers. Besidesthermal effects, the potentialfor photochemical changesin the eye also may resultfrom some laser injuries.Combinations of charringand lacerations may oc-cur with high-energy laserinjuries, which require a farmore complex medical re-sponse than ones producedby standard ﬁ rearms.•  Psychological impact:Once personnel, both mili-tary and law enforcement,realize that utilizing magni-fying optics or viewing theoperational space with the•  Silent: No detonation orback blast is required as aby-product of operating alaser because no internalcombustion or chemical re-action takes place to powerthe laser beam.•  Potentially invisible: Infra-red lasers are invisible to thehuman eye, thus typicallyundetectable without infra-red detection equipment.

This is compounded by infrared laser use because damage to the eye can be taking place without the target initially even knowing that it is happening.Target SetsLaser devices and weapons have disruptive (visual) and destructive (primarily thermal) effects upon their targets. Under normal viewing conditions, weaker low-energy lasers have only disruptive effects, whereas stronger ones also have eye damage and destructive capa-bilities that allow them to start ﬁ res and either melt or burn through objects that have little density. The weaker lasers, such as laser pointers, typically are effective at night for vision disruption purposes, while the stronger systems can be used both in daytime and nighttime conditions. A laser, like any other device or weapon, may be employed by criminals, terror-ists, or military combatants.The target sets that can be disrupted, and potentially destroyed, by using lasers are pretty much the same for both law enforcement and civil aviation applications. However, civil aviation tends to have many more soft targets, such as fuel trucks, even though police “new gunpowder revolution”8and still adheres to that observa-tion. Laser weapons and devices will have an immense impact on future policing activities, es-pecially in the coming decades when they mature as systems and eventually move along the continuum from exotic to what will be considered more con-ventional weapons. This impact is projected to come about primarily because of two broad waves of change in this type of weapon’s usage.The ﬁ rst, derived from negligence and ignorance, represents the vast majority of incidents, criminal intent, and eventual terrorist and global insurgent use of these systems.9 Millions of handheld laser pointers and other low-energy laser devices have been helicopters are much softer tar-gets than passenger airliners.Tactics, techniques, and procedures for individual user and opposing force laser ap-plications can be generated for law enforcement red-teaming purposes.7 Needless to say, as with any targeting endeavor, weapons effects can be matched to target-set weaknesses and vulnerabilities, and a reasonably competent operations plan can be constructed. In this instance, the eyes (vision) of law enforce-ment and commercial avia-tion personnel are the greatest vulnerabilities.ConclusionSeveral years ago, one of the authors characterized the emergence of lasers and di-rected energy weapons as a Target SetsLaw Enforcement•  Personnel (line ofﬁ cers, specialized units, supervisors)•  Matériel (police cars, helicopters, ﬁ xed-wing aircraft, equipment)•  Infrastructure (buildings, communication systems)Civil Aviation•  Personnel (pilots, ﬂ ight crews, passengers, mainte-nance staff, rescue workers)•  Matériel (aircraft, fuel trucks, equipment)•  Infrastructure (terminals, control towers, radar, communication systems)66719.indd 5   2/28/2008 7:26:26 PM    6 / FBI Law Enforcement Bulletinmanufactured over the past fewdecades, and now dozens, if nothundreds, of them are directedat civil, commercial, military,and law enforcement aircraft;police and emergency servicespersonnel; professional andamateur athletes; bus drivers;and everyday citizens on ayearly basis. Fortunately, themajority of these devices, undernormal viewing conditions, donot pose eye hazards. Still, theselasers may offer signiﬁ cantvisual disruption potentials.Regardless of user intent,this wave of change alreadyhas begun and is based onlasers as threat systems to lawenforcement ofﬁ cers. An even-tual component of this waveAt about 10 p.m. on March 21, 1998, I was the ﬂ ight ofﬁ cer aboard the Ontario, Cali-fornia, Police Department=s helicopter orbiting a burglary in progress. As I was directingground ofﬁ cers to the suspect, the pilot, Pete Ambriz, told me that we were being illumi-nated by a laser. Fortunately, he could maintain control of the helicopter. After ofﬁ cerstook the suspect into custody, Pete turned in the direction of the laser and ﬂ ew about 500feet above the ground. Our aircraft, modiﬁ ed with two strobes for low-level operations inthe area of our international airport, also had a 50-million candlepower searchlight, so wecould be seen for miles.At that point, I was looking at the horizon and saw the laser beam. It was angled fromthe ground below and to the left of the aircraft and was not bright enough to cause concern.Suddenly, however, it moved up and right and, within an instant, a bright intense red lightcovered the front windscreen and interior of the cockpit. The beam was too bright to seethrough, and there was no visibility to the front of the aircraft. I could see the beam mov-ing, and, occasionally, I could see forward as the beam tracked our aircraft. I saw Peteﬂ ying while looking out the left side of the aircraft as he kept his heading. After about 10seconds, I saw the beam move downward, fade, then turn off. As the beam was movingaway from the aircraft, I could clearly see its source. The beam was so intense, straight,and bright that it pointed like an arrow to its source. As it was turned off, I saw it glowdown and move north at the rear of a house and then inside what turned out to be the rearsliding door. Later, I determined the distance to be just over 1 mile, or about 14 city blocks.I learned from the manufacturer of the device that, at that distance, the beam would havebeen approximately 7 feet in diameter.I directed Pete to the home and had a ground unit respond. The ofﬁ cer contacted thesuspect and retrieved the device. The suspect subsequently admitted aiming the device atthe helicopter and eventually pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor violation of California PenalCode Section 247.5, Discharging a Laser at an Aircraft. He was sentenced to 3 months inthe county jail and 3 years on probation.Detective Parra serves with the Ontario, California, Police Department.Airborne Law Enforcement Laser IlluminationBy Alfredo Parra, Jr.66719.indd  6 2/28/2008  6:17:48 PMof change will be the creationof law enforcement policies,tactics, and countermeasureswith respect to laser threats.10The second wave of changeis expected to be based onthe utilization of lasers andother directed energy devicesby law enforcement agenciesthemselves. This can be seentoday with laser sights addedto ﬁ rearms and the use of laserdazzlers as less lethal formsof force. While this wave ofchange remains immature, overtime, more and more directed-energy capabilities will beimplemented for law enforce-ment use.With such scenarios inmind, the law enforcementprofession must recognize thatlasers are emerging as the weap-ons of the future. Just as theﬁ rearm ushered in the modernera, the laser will profoundlyinﬂ uence what transpires forsucceeding generations.Endnotes1 The authors’ past writings on laserthreats include Dan Lindsay and Robert J.Bunker, “The Laser Threat to CaliforniaAirborne Law Enforcement,” The Journalof California Law Enforcement 34, no.2 (March-April 2000): 12-20 (an earlierversion, “The Laser Threat to AirborneLaw Enforcement,” appeared in two partsin Air Beat (November/December 1998,26-29 and January/February 1999, 14-16);and Robert J.

JonesRethinking the Development of Weapons and Their ImpactConventional weaponry may be effectively harmful to our enemies, but pollution from these weapons is severely impacting the environment as well.As you read about the history of humans, you see very early on that humans are naturally “tool users.”  More specifically, humans used tools as a means of subsis-tence and survival. Even today humans use tools to extend their capabilities beyond imagination. axes and knife-like tools made from stone and flint could be used to pound or hammer or cut. The earliest humans were hunter-gatherers and for survival had to capture or kill “an evening meal.” Spears, bows, and arrows became tools for hunting to kill larger prey for food and subsistence. However primitive, these early weapons would soon be used against other hu-mans to defend territorial domains, to defend against other warring groups, or for protection against large predator animals.The “inconvenient truth”  we must face as a society is that weapons are necessary as we defend our country from for-eign as well as domestic enemies. Whether it is a catastroph-ic event such as 9/11, a shooting on a college campus, or our commitments to help our allies overseas during wartime, our military and police need weapons to defend against these ad-versaries. However, we can also note that weapons are used for recreation as well—in hunting and shooting competitions for example. Given the enormous number of weapons used for protection or recreation, can we expect that conventional weapons are harmful to the environment? absolutely, in many ways, and have been since the Greeks used sulfur mix-tures to produce suffocating fumes in the Trojan War (431 BC) (Harigel, 2001).  Conventional weaponry may be effectively harmful to our enemies, but pollution from these weapons is severely impacting the environment as well. Some of these weapons include chemical, biological, depleted uranium, landmines, nuclear, jet fighters, and even the conventional lead bullets fired from rifles and handguns. “It is estimated that the Pen-tagon generates five times more toxins than the five major U.S. chemical companies combined” (Hay-Edie, 2002). The U.S. military is the “largest single source” of environmental pollution in the United States. It is estimated that the cost to clean up military-related sites costs approximately $500 bil-lion dollars (Hay-Edie, 2002).Chemical Weapons  although the disposal of chemical weapons in the ocean ended in 1970, there is still concern about the potential hazards they may have on human health and safety as well as ocean life (Bearden, 2007). Following World Wars I and II the most effective and efficient way to dispose of chemical weapons was to dump them in the ocean. Between 1945 and 1970, our oceans became the dumping grounds for chemi- technology and engineering teacher     november 201113cal weapons—some of which were known to be leaking and/or damaged and posing immediate risk to those handling the weapons. The U.S. contributed 93,995 tons, France 9,250 tons, Britain 122,508 tons, and Russia 70,500 tons to the ocean floor. The United States has also dumped approximate-ly 100,000 tons (the equivalent to 39 railroad cars) in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of New Jersey, California, Florida, South Carolina, India, Italy, Norway, Denmark, Japan, and australia (Harigel, 2001). Specific locations of dumping are not known, making it difficult to ascertain exactly who is at risk. While some of these weapons are water soluble, others are not and can remain active for many years. Others are denser than seawater and may remain on the floor of the ocean, where they pose a greater threat. In addition, colder temperatures prevent the degradation of the chemicals (Bearden, 2007). Ocean currents can carry contamination far beyond the original site where chemicals were dumped. In the Baltic Sea, fishermen have reported catching “encrusted sulphur mustard” in fishing nets while trawling, posing threats to sea life as well as humans (Bearden, 2007). as these weapons continue to deteriorate, they threaten our seas and the ocean life, extending threats to humans and the environ-ment around them.  In addition to the disposal of chemical weapons, the use of chemical weapons during wartime has long-lasting effects as well. While harmful chemicals were used to gas humans to death in Nazi concentration camps, one of the more recent well-known uses of chemical weapons is agent Orange. It is estimated that the U.S. military used 19 million gallons of agent Orange in the Vietnam War between 1962 and 1971. This herbicide killed trees and other vegetation, allowing for troops to better see the enemy. However, it also had an over-whelming effect on human and wildlife populations. We are still dealing with the lingering effects of this chemical nearly 50 years later. agent Orange contaminated the Vietnamese soil and water, passing into the food supplies, and specifically contaminating fish that the Vietnamese eat as a basic staple. However, the contamination of the human population is very clear as well. We see serious health effects in the Vietnamese people as well as our own military families that were affected by this harmful chemical. These health issues include, but are not limited to, cancer and serious birth defects  (N.a., N.D.).  another use of “chemicals” to harm human populations and the environment occurred on September 11, 2001. When terrorists used commercial airliners to attack the World Trade Center, the explosion released chemical agents in “90,000 liters of jet fuel [that] burned at temperatures around 1,000 degrees C” (Enzler, 2006). This fuel explosion released toxins into the air. Clouds of gaseous particles continued to form and expand over much of Manhattan and Brooklyn, exposing everyone in their path to dangerous chemicals for weeks. Some of the effects have been seen in rescue workers suffering from respiratory diseases; however, it may be years before we see the full effects of this act of terrorism on the human population and environment that was exposed.Biological WeaponsBiological weapons are categorized into three basic types: spore-forming bacteria; vegetative bacteria (nonspore-form-ing); and viruses (Stuart, 2005). Studies have indicated that survival of these agents increases in air, water, textiles, and in soil (Stuart, 2005). Biological weapons may be more harm-Figure 1. Chemical weapons are the most insidious of weapons, as their presence is not obvious. They are hidden from view, and they may be in the form of gases, liquids, and powders that lie in wait for unsuspecting military or civilian personnel. Their effects may be im-mediate in paralyzing a human or animal or cause a lingering death and lead to extensive environmental damage.

They spread disease and infections that cannot be detected immediately and lie in the environment around us for years, continu-ing to infect humans and the environment. In addition, it is very difficult to predict the impact of these weapons since viability depends on physiological factors in both the agent and the host at the time of contamination. Hence, sampling will result in more actual, accurate data instead of predicting what the hazards may be to the environment (Stuart, 2005). In addition to wartime weapon development, these agents have been developed to control illegal crops (i.e. poppy fields in afghanistan and the coca plant in Columbia). However, biological weapons also spread disease and destroy the environment around them; they are just as much a threat to humans as they are to ecosystems and wildlife. Biological weapons applied on a large scale can wipe out entire popula-tions quickly and without forewarning. Sometimes the ef-fects are not known for months or perhaps even years. This, in particular, makes predicting their impact very difficult.Depleted Uranium Used during the Gulf War (approximately 600,000 lbs.), depleted uranium (DU) has a half-life of 4.5 billion years, making this a long-term problem. In afghanistan, there is evidence that DU ammunition has been used, causing con-tamination to the environment and “long-term health haz-ards” (Hay-Edie, 2002). It is the by-product of the extraction process after natural uranium and extract-enriched uranium are combined for nuclear fuel and weapons (Pesic, 2005). DU is delivered with conventional weapons (i.e., tank rounds, machine guns, Gatling guns, artillery, and even sniper rifles) and significantly increases the “lethal range” of these conven-tional weapons (Pesic, 2005). Upon impact, DU converts to radioactive dust, which is easily ingested. The World Health Organization has suggested that children are the most vul-nerable to DU due to the fact that “typical hand-to-mouth activity in inquisitive play could lead to high DU ingestion from contaminated soil” (N.a., N.D.). Biological effects of ingestion are both radiological and chemical and may include kidney failure and cancers related to the immune system, blood, and/or bone (Pesic, 2005).Landminesa passionate cause of the late Princess Diana of Great Britain was to highlight the fact that landmines pollute the world. Sixty (60) to 110 million landmines cover the ground around the world, including hundreds of thousands littering the fields and mountains of afghanistan (Hay-Edie, 2002). annu-ally, landmines are responsible for over 26,000 deaths across the globe, not including wild and domesticated animals. They account for other issues related to deforestation, soil erosion, and water pollution as well. These mines account for not only physical and emotional injury in humans and animals, but also leave farmlands rendered useless, creating severe short-ages of food and thus causing malnutrition in some areas of the world.a relatively new development that has appeared in the wars in Iraq and afghanistan are IEDs or “improvised explo-Figure 2. As military planners, scientists, and engineers as well as terrorists develop new weapons, researchers are looking for ways to counter those weapons with new technologies. Shown here is a Foster-Miller Talon Mk.II searching an area while a Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) provides a 360-degree view as the two work together to search for a simulated improvised explosive device (Credit: Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division).

Unlike land mines that lie dormant until some unsuspecting soldier or civilian steps on them, IEDs can be triggered by remote wireless control, push buttons, or trip wires. They result in devastatingly serious injury or death. To counter such weapon threats, new technologies are being developed to discover and disarm such weapons. Figure 2 shows a micro air vehicle searching for a simulated IED.Nuclear Weapons  The danger of nuclear weapons is astounding. a global nuclear war has the potential to kill more than three bil-lion people—half of the world’s population. The additional radiation that would remain in the air, soil, and water would affect the surviving population. Nuclear weapons would wipe out land and water supplies, rendering the world without the ability to grow food and resulting in starvation in much of the population. Life would literally cease to exist on earth.Nearly seventy years ago, in the midst of World War II, a decision was made to explore and develop a nuclear weapon that would eventually become the world’s most powerful and devastating weapon. It was feared that adolf Hitler’s Germany would develop a similar weapon first. Subsequently would begin what is now known as the “nuclear age.” The Manhattan Project brought together engineers, scientists, and technicians from around the United States to develop an atomic weapon of such scale that it would bring to a close a global war. It is important to note that nuclear science was in its infancy at this time, and little was known about the health effects of radiation and nuclear materials on humans. The construction of the world’s first atomic bomb began at the Los alamos Laboratory in New Mexico under the direction of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer (aCHRE, 2011).Jet FightersJet fuel used to power jet fighters is as toxic to the environ-ment as any other weapon. Jet fuel pollutes the air, soil, and water around us. Many times, the military has been known to “dump” fuel from jets in bodies of water as well as over unpopulated land areas. a typical jet fighter burns 105 liters (or 27.74 U.S. gallons) of jet fuel per minute (1,664.40 gal-lons per hour), while a C-17 cargo jet burns 11,350 liters per hour (or 2,998.35 U.S. gallons) (Biello, 2011). To put this in perspective, one typical U.S. car burns .8 gallons per hour if running idle. Given this tremendous amount of fuel that is burned by military jets, we can imagine the impact emis-sions and dumping of fuel has on our environment. However, the military has announced that it is reducing its carbon footprint in several ways. First, Navy Secretary Ray Mabus announced in 2009 that the Navy would be building the “Green Hornet,” a biofuel-powered F/a-18 jet fighter ready for flight in three years. This initiative is expected to save ap-proximately 127,000 barrels of fuel per year and provide for a much cleaner-burning fuel source to help the war on pollu-tion (Tirella, 2009). In addition, the military is also expected to convert its entire fleet of 50,000 vehicles to electric and hybrids by the year 2015 (Tirella, 2009).Lead Bullets Lead has been determined to be one of the most deadly toxins on earth. In the 20th century it is estimated that 20 million tons of lead bullets have been fired in the United States (Virginia Tech, 2004). Researchers at Virginia Tech say that there are approximately 9,000 military and nonmilitary shooting ranges in the United States. “Some 60,000 metric tons of lead are expended by shooting, so there are lead bul-lets everywhere” (Virginia Tech, 2004). Studying a shooting range in Blacksburg, Va, researchers found that lead is ab-Figure 3. Shown is an aerial photo of the second bombing of Naga-saki, Japan in August, 1945. The unusual but characteristic plume of a nuclear explosion creates devastatingly high winds and tempera-tures at ground-zero level. The resulting destruction is immediate, and the effects of radiation linger (Library of Congress). [See www.loc.gov/pictures/item/98506956/] technology and engineering teacher     november 201116sorbed in the “top few inches of the soil and does not migrate beyond that” (Virginia Tech, 2004). In addition, significant amounts were found in trees, which means that when trees are cut down, they will contain lead contaminate.a study published by the Environmental Working Group in 2001 suggests that people who regularly visit the shooting range as well as their families are susceptible to lead expo-sure. Lead settles into clothing, footwear, and other items of clothing typically worn to the range. “Take-home exposure” is said to be one of the leading causes of secondary lead poi-soning (Diaz, 2001). However, direct poisoning can be found in those who cast their own bullets, as “melting lead pro-duces a fume which can remain in the air for several hours” (Diaz, 2001). an example of secondary exposure can be found in a day-care center in Clearwater, FL. This day-care center was forced to close because a shooting range located next door was emitting lead-contaminated air into the play-ground of the day-care center. Children received blood tests to determine contamination and extent of contamination (Diaz, 2001). Even construction workers in charge of demoli-tion of a shooting range tested positive for lead contamina-tion, as did their children.Both studies above collected data from a contained area, a shooting range. What about the areas where hunting and wars take place? In these areas, we see less control and per-haps more widespread contamination from lead bullets fired from manual and automatic weapons.  So, what are we doing to be more environmentally conscious while maintaining weapons to protect against our enemies and continuing to allow for recreational use as well?  BaE Systems, a British arms manufacturer, is designing re-duced-lead bullets and grenades with reduced smoke, as well as lower-toxin rockets in hopes of lowering carbon emissions (Ungoed-Thomas, 2006). Dr. Debbie allen, Director of Cor-porate Social Responsibility says, “Weapons are going to be used, and when they are, we try to make them as safe for the user as possible, to limit the collateral damage, and to impact as little as possible on the environment” (Ungoed-Thomas, 2006).Design Initiative for Studentsas students enter the class they will see an image of a baby born with birth defects such as missing limbs—a shocking photograph with a caption below similar to this one: “The re-sults of the war ten years ago.” These kinds of images are very graphic but at the same time very effective in highlighting the impact of weaponry and other toxic materials. after a few minutes, ask the students if they know who is re-sponsible for the situation of the baby and how we can have such tragic images ten years after active war. assign groups of three, where students will be responsible to investigate, conduct research, and come up with solutions to the issue. Once solutions are being identified, they should be presented to the rest of the class, and a plan of work should be devel-oped to solve the problem. Provide ideas, such as a day trip to a recycling facility, where students can see alternative materials that can replace toxic or nonbiodegradable ma-terials. Introduce the students to several organizations and provide information about recycling, environmental issues, and balancing environmental concerns and social concerns with technological advancement.activities such as the one described above are easy to corre-late with ITEEa’s technological literacy standards. See Table 1 for correlations with ITEEa’s STL standards.SummaryEven though war is a tragedy on its own, sometimes it can be the only solution to prevent the worst. It is vital that we promote the manufacturing of biodegradable weapons that don’t pollute the environment and also strengthen the laws that prohibit the use of toxic and other chemical weapons; otherwise, the direct output of this concept—the existence of humanity in the years to come—will be questionable.

Relying primarily on data from the incident-based Monterey WMD Database, it employs multinomial logit regression with C, B, R, or N as a categorical dependent variable: a first within the relevant econometric literature. Fundamentally, the study tests the widely-held—although empirically unsubstantiated—technological deterministic assumption that the more readily CBRN technology, materials, and knowledge are accessible to terrorists, the more likely terrorists will be to use unconventional weapons of the corresponding kind: a relationship hypothesized to be stronger for serious attack perpetrators than for hoaxers. Next, the study tests the notion of a continuum of proliferation potential, hypothesizing that as states’ regulatory capacity increases, biological terrorism will be most likely and nuclear terrorism will be least likely. Finally, the study assesses variables that have previously been proven as significant determinants of CBRN over conventional terrorism, to provide the groundwork for future evaluation of the extent to which terrorists may be induced to pursue C, B, R, or N over conventional weapons.Cette étude explore les facteurs, en supposant qu'un terroriste ait franchi le seuil des armes traditionnelles en utilisant des armes non traditionnelles comme les armes chimiques, biologiques, radiologiques et nucléaires (CBRN), qui détermineront la possibilité qu'il/elle choisisse d'utiliser les armes C, B, R ou N.

Experimental studies and ethnographic reports provide conflicting results regarding the relative importance of the functional, economic, and social roles of hafted hunting technology. The controlled experiment reported here was designed to test the functional hypothesis for stone-tipped weapons using spears and ballistics gelatin. It differs from previous investigations of this type because it includes a quantitative analysis of wound track profiles and focuses specifically on hand-delivered spear technology. Our results do not support the hypothesis that tipped spears penetrate deeper than untipped spears. However, tipped spears create a significantly larger inner wound cavity that widens distally. This inner wound cavity is analogous to the permanent wound cavity in ballistics research, which is considered the key variable affecting the relative ‘stopping power’ or ‘killing power’ of a penetrating weapon.

INTRODUCTION  Nowadays, terrorist groups, hijackers, and people hiding guns and knifes are a constant and increasing threat. Concealed weapon detection has turned into one of the greatest challenges facing the law enforcement community today in terms of crime prevention and anti-terrorism [1]. Current screening procedures for detecting concealed weapons such as handguns, knives are common in controlled access settings such as airports, entrances to sensitive buildings, and public events. Unfortunately screening in this way, prior to entering controlled areas, is sometimes ineffective in preventing some weapons from getting through and also produces bottle-necks in crowded environments. A reliable concealed weapon detection system able to work in an open area and able to discriminate between ferromagnetic weapons is necessary.  In order to discriminate ferromagnetic weapons, a parameter which can be used as a signature for weapon discrimination has to be found.  To begin with, a weapon detection system based on pulse induction technology able to work in open areas without invading individual privacy is being studied. This approach includes the use of a uniform magnetic field generator [2] for transmitting Heavy step pulses that cause eddy currents to flow in any metal object carried by the person. The eddy currents excited in the metal body take the form of an exponentially decaying transient immediately following sudden changes in the exciting magnetic field. This decay curve can be used to obtain a time constant of the current decay which is highly dependent of the size, shape and material composition [3]. A numerical model is presented to study the potential use of time constant as a signature for weapon discrimination and simulation results are presented and discussed.  2. THEORY FOR ELECTROMAGNETIC WEAPONS DETECTION AND IDENTIFICATION  The proposed method uses low frequency electromagnetic fields and is based on suitable solutions of Maxwell’s equations. The difficulty comes when computing the magnetic field scattered from conductive masses when it is energised with a low frequency electromagnetic field. The subject has been analysed in detail by Kaufman and Keller [4].   To solve the problem, the weapon is approximated to a sphere with radius “a” and a conductivity “σ ” and is irradiated with an electromagnetic wave in the form of step pulses. When the pulse occurs, the weapon is illuminated by a step change in the amplitude of the magnetic field vector which is considered to be planar in the vicinity of the weapon. The magnetic field in the vicinity of the weapon is defined as “H ”.  0 1School of Computing and Engineering Researchers’ Conference, University of Huddersfield, Dec 2007  Using a quasi-static solution of Maxwell’s equations, it is found that the primary magnetic field around the sphere is increased by an amount due to currents to flow within the sphere given by the following three equations (for more details see [4])  302 2 213 sin[ ( 1)(sq ta ss sKB a q eER k a K Kφθ −∞== + − −∑ 2)]                  (1) 303 2 216 cos[ ( 1)(sq taRs sKB a eBR k a K Kθ −∞== + − −∑ 2)]          (2) 303 2 213 sin[ ( 1)(sq tas sKB a eBR k a K Kθθ −∞== + − −∑ 2)]       (3)  where “ ”, “ ”, “ ” are the only components of the anomalous fields caused by currents induced in the sphere. These components are expressed in a spherical coordinate system centred on the sphere, with “R” being in the direction of the incident field. The others quantities in the equations as defined as: aEφaRBaBθ0/ μμ=K  (The relative magnetic permeability of the weapon)     (4) σμ/2ss kq =             (5) απ /sks =  (s=1, 2, 3,…,∞ )         (6) and “t” is time, following the initiation of the current step.  The form of each electromagnetic field component is that of a sum of exponentially decaying transients. The asymptotic behaviour of these transients is now examined. During the early part of the transient response of the electromagnetic field (t?0), the expressions for the anomalous magnetic field components are as follow:  30 ( / ) cos [1 6 / ( ) ]aRB B a R tθ π α= − 1/ 2         (7) 301/ 2( / ) sin [1 6 / ( ) ]aB B a R tθ θ π α= − 1/ 2        (8)  During the late part f the transient decay, the field is almost entirely determined by the first exponential terms: 0cos6 320 τθπtaR eRaBB−⎟⎠⎞⎜⎝⎛=           (9)      0sin3 320 τθ θπta eRaBB−⎟⎠⎞⎜⎝⎛=            (10) 0sin3 3200 τφ θπτta eRaaBE−⎟⎠⎞⎜⎝⎛= , where  is a time constant.    (11) a220 πσματ = These results are the basis for the design of a highly effective weapons detection system. Each of the three expressions for field components is of the form of a product of two terms, the first term of which involves only the geometry and magnitude of the primary field in the vicinity of the weapon, and a second term involving a time constant, but independent of the geometry and strength of the field incident on the weapon. Measurement of the time constant provides a means for weapon detection which is free of false alarms due to variations in primary field strength. A time constant can be determined from a plot of the transient magnetic field on semi log graph paper (the slope of the curve is the time constant). The time constant can also be determined from the expression: 0 / /aaRaRBBaB t Bθθτ = − = −∂ ∂ ∂ ∂t          (12)  2School of Computing and Engineering Researchers’ Conference, University of Huddersfield, Dec 2007  The time constant is a function only of the conductivity-permeability product of a sphere and its cross sectional area.  Weapons have a complex geometry, so a question arises as to whether or not conclusions for simple geometries extend to more complicated shapes. Kaufman and Keller (1985) extended the analysis to axial symmetry and arrive at an expression for the scattering time constant as follows:  20 / qτ σμα= , where “q” depends on the shape of the conductive body.    (13)  The expression shows the potential of the time constant in identifying a specific weapon of an even more complicated shape. All weapons of the same size, shape and metallic composition will be characterised by a scattered electromagnetic field from an incident current step will be the same, no matter what the strength or the incident field on the distance of the weapon from the transmitter or the receiver array. Thus weapons can be classified at least within the precision with which the time constant of the decaying magnetic field can be determined.  3.  TIME CONSTANT OF A TYPICAL WEAPON  The appropriate way to determine the time constant for a real weapon is by illuminating that weapon with an electromagnetic field using step pulses and measuring the time constant from the decaying field. Usually the weapon will be carried on the body of a person. However the time constant associated with the human body might obscure that of the weapon. An estimate as to whether this will happen can be made by substituting numbers in the expression (13). For example, assume that the conductivity-permeability of the steel in a weapon is of the order of 1 siemens x henries x square meter, the radius of the sphere enclosing a weapon is 0.1 meter, the form factor “q” is 10 (the more convoluted the shape of the metallic object the greater will be the form factor).  With these numbers, the order of magnitude estimate for the time constant of the hypothetical weapon is 1 millisecond. In the human body, flesh and bone are conductive and the conductivity-permeability product for a human body is of the order of 10 siemens x henries x square meter. Thus the corresponding order of magnitude time constant for a human body is 0.1 microsecond. Although these are only estimates, the two time constants are so different that there is no likelihood that one will obscure the other.  4. PROPOSED WEAPON DETECTION SYSTEM  A non-obtrusive weapon detection system based on pulse induction technology able to work in open areas without invading individual privacy is being studied. The current approach includes the use of magnetic field generator for transmitting electromagnetic step pulses that cause eddy currents to flow in any metal object carried by the person. The proposed magnetic field generator consists of a group of parallel current carrying cables laid below the floor that produce a horizontal magnetic field.  This field falls off more slowly at the edges than that produced by conventional loop coils. The eddy currents produced in the metal object generate a magnetic signal that is detected by arrays of magnetic field sensors as illustrated in Figure 1.  The eddy currents excited in the metal body take the form of an exponentially decaying transient immediately following sudden changes in the exciting magnetic field. This decay curve can be used to obtain a time constant of the current decay. The transient time decay is a sum of exponentials, where the late part of transient decay is entirely determined by the first exponential term. Algorithms for an accurate determination of a time constant must be developed.  The present stage of the project is focalised in experimental tests leaving for later stage signal processing and developing of algorithms for time constant extraction. However one of the intended algorithms consists of the transformation of the signal strength by using the logarithm of the signal. With this transformation, an exponential decay curve appears as straight line, with the slope being the time constant. We can see this transformation in plots of figure 4, 6, 7, and 8. The time constant (slope of the line) can be extracted by curve fitting (best-fit one –parameter linear function) of the transformed data.  The authors in [3] found that for a sphere illuminated with an electromagnetic wave in the form of step pulses, the time constant is independent of the strength of the field incident magnetic field and highly dependent of the size, shape and material composition.  If a metal body is shown to have a unique time decay response, a library of potential threat metal objects can be developed. When a metal body is encountered in the field, its time decay response can be compared to those in the library, and if a match is found, the metal body can be classified.  To test the method a simplified 3-D model in COMSOL 3.3 (figure 3) has been used. It is suitable to  3School of Computing and Engineering Researchers’ Conference, University of Huddersfield, Dec 2007  analyse sensitivity/insensitivity of induced current response to changes in shapes and orientation of interrogated objects. The model consists of a magnetic field generator (20 parallel cables laid on the floor, 2cm in between) for transmitting step pulse of current of 10A, 1.5ms width, fall time 170us, causing eddy currents to flow in a nearby metal object (60cm over the cables). The eddy currents scatter a signal that will be detected by a three-axis magnetic sensor array (hall or magneto-resistive sensors) placed between the cables. Parameter values used in the model are based on previews studies and simulations performed to achieve a strong enough magnetic field.     5. SIMULATIONS  5.1 SENSITIVITY TO OUTER SHAPE Four different samples: Gun1 with smooth barrel and smooth bore, Gun2 with square barrel and smooth bore, and two knives with different cross section as showed in figure 2 are tested independently. In figure 3, the magnetic flux density (B) along z-axis and y-axis is picked up at 35cm from the object along perpendicular line between object and floor. Following the intended algorithm for time constant extraction, logarithm of magnetic flux density is plotted against time in order to show more clearly time constant of each interrogated object (figure 4).  5.2 INSENSITIVITY TO OBJECT ORIENTATION In the following test a gun (steel) is oriented in three positions as seen in figure 5. Results showed that even the amplitude of the signal changes the time of decay stays invariant. Also the measurements have been taken at different distance from the gun (15cm and 35cm as shown in figure 6) to show how the time constant is independent of the strength of the field incident.  5.3 SENSITIVITY TO SIZE  Three guns of the same type but different sizes are tested. In this test a coil is added to the model to sense the time decay of induced current (Eddy current) caused for the abrupt change of the magnetic field. Results in figure 7 show that time constant is a function of cross sectional area of the sample. Because large metallic objects store more energy than small ones, time decay of collapsing magnetic field (or induced current in the coil) takes longer. This characteristic could be potentially used to discriminate object size.  5.4 SENSITIVITY TO MATERIAL COMPOSITION  A same sample (gun1 as seen in figure 2) with different material composition (copper, iron, and steel) is tested. The time constant profile is clearly different for each case confirming the potential of the new weapon detection system to identify objects with different material composition.  6. CONCLUSIONS  Tests have shown that time decay measurements obtained from simulations of the proposed weapon detection system are sensitive to the shape, size, and material composition of the target. Furthermore, the time decay profile is independent of the strength of the magnetic flux density and is independent of distance from the sample. Measurements taken in any direction also show an agreement in time decay profile and the magnitude of the received signal at 45 cm from the sample is of the order of 10 Tesla. There are many magnetic sensors on the market able to detect these levels: search-coil magnetometer; flux-gate magnetometer; SQUID magnetometer; GMR etc). The results look very encouraging in terms of effectiveness and reduction in the level of false alarms. 5− REFERENCES  [1] V. Sutton and D.

novel weapons hypothesis,30835814,Nuclear threaths from terrorist : -ft or fiction?,,"Kristine, Rakkenes",2005,"Summary  After the terrorist attack on 9/11 on New York City and the Pentagon, it could seen to be an increase of speculation in the media whether terrorist organizations would escalate to use weapons of mass destruction, and more specifically, nuclear weapons.  This thesis asks two questions, (1) why have terrorist organizations not used nuclear weapons, and (2) should we expect terrorist organizations to use nuclear weapons in the future?    Two factors have been taken into consideration: firstly, is it possible for terrorist organizations to acquire access to nuclear weapons? Without access, there is no chance of nuclear weapons in the wrong hands. Secondly, given that access to material is possible, is it, and if when, in terrorist organizations’ interest to use nuclear weapons, and what can they gain from it?  Terrorist organizations are not known at this time to possess the capabilities to produce weapons grade material independently.  However, some terrorist organizations have shown interest in acquiring nuclear capabilities and there is evidence of attempts to smuggle nuclear material.    This thesis has provided three answers to the research questions presented.   1) Nuclear weapons and nuclear material is difficult - almost impossible - to develop by terrorist organizations alone. 2) It might be possible to acquire nuclear weapons or nuclear material through clandestine means. 3) If a terrorist organization is able to acquire nuclear weapons, it might not serve their goals to use them",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/masterThesis, Studentarbeider",,,

Methods: Data were derived from a population-based sample of male (N = 224) and female (N = 244) adolescents followed from grade 10 (M age = 15.5) to grade 11 (M age = 16.5). Peer networks were derived from best friend nominations. Self-reports were used to assess weapon carrying. Aggression and victimization were assessed using both self- and peer-reports. Use of dynamic social network modeling (SIENA) allowed prediction of weapon carrying in grade 11 as a function of weapon carrying of befriended peers, aggression, and victimization in grade 10, while selection processes and structural network effects (reciprocity and transitivity) were controlled for. Results: Peer influence processes accounted for changes in weapon carrying over time. Self-reported victimization decreased weapon carrying 1 year later. Peer-reported victimization increased the likelihood of weapon carrying, particularly for highly aggressive adolescents. Boys were more likely to carry weapons than girls, but the processes associated with weapon carrying did not differ for boys and girls. Conclusions: These findings revealed that, in this population-based sample, weapon carrying of best friends, as well as aggression, contributed to the proliferation of weapons in friendship networks, suggesting processes of peer contagion as well as individual vulnerability to weapon carrying.6 p",,Article / Letter to editor,Social Development,,'Elsevier BV'
novel weapons hypothesis,481156016,The swords of Damocles : explaining unconventional weapon non-use in modern war,,"Claar, Martin",2017,"Advisors: Andrea Radasanu.Committee members: Scot Schraufnagel; S. Adam Seagrave; Ches Thurber.Includes bibliographical references.This dissertation investigates the logic for unconventional weapon non-use during wars in the 20th Century. International relations scholarship has offered two primary explanatory factors for the non-use of radiological, biological and chemical weapons: either it is a result of power concerns and utility or due to adherence to taboo norms. However, these logics are insufficient in explaining oscillations in policy, near misses and instances of actual use. Thus, I argue that normative concerns based on the rules of war as associated with Just War theory impact the decisions concerning unconventional weapons. Consideration of the discriminatory and proportionality norms associated with Just War theory best reflect why states with opportunity and motive would abstain from use, while instances of supreme emergency would explain a state's use policies or narrow misses. To test this explanation, a series of case studies will examined involving the only state to ever use both chemical and nuclear weapons---the United States. Using primary decision-making documents, supplemented with secondary historical sources, the motivation for U.S. policies should be apparent. Afterward, considerations of applicability to other cases or new weapons technology will be considered.Ph.D. (Doctor of Philosophy",,"Text, Dissertation/Thesis","Political science, International relations, Philosophy, Armed Forces--Study and teaching",,Northern Illinois University

novel weapons hypothesis,360551877,How Rebellious Non-State-Actors acquire weapons,,"Zohar, Eran",2015,"Recent events in world politics, such as the civil wars in Syria and Iraq and conflicts between powerful rebel groups and weak governments in Africa, underline the need for a comprehensive theory to explain how Non States Actors (NSAs) acquire weapons and the factors that influence these efforts. Rebellious activity has been an integral part of political life since ancient times and has taken diverse forms. There were always those who revolted and took up arms against central rule. Weapons were not necessarily the most important factor but rebels needed weapons to fight and usually revolts erupted after the organizers acquired some weapons while many revolts lost their momentum, and operations were not carried out or effective due to shortages in arms and ammunition. Conflicts between governments and armed NSAs have always outnumbered inter-state wars and are not a new phenomenon as some scholars claim. In the last decade NSAs have accelerated the acquisition of large sophisticated weapons systems. They could be better armed than states’ armies because of their access to advanced technologies in the possession of supporting countries or international arms markets. Other NSAs, lacking external support, employ Mao’s principle of self-reliance. They live on their enemies’ arms stocks and improvised weaponry.  Available literature on armed NSAs is incomplete because it addresses partial aspects of the problem. This thesis is an attempt to construct a substantive theory explaining NSAs’ arming, offering generic phases and principles that characterize past and present NSAs and probably the NSAs of the near future. The thesis also checks how globalization has affected the way rebellious NSAs acquire arms. In spite of dramatic political and technological changes, rebel groups in different periods have employed similar methods to acquire weapons. Self-production, looting and stealing, external support and arms trade were always the major methods for NSAs to acquire armaments, though the importance of each method and the type of arms changed remarkably over time. Persistent principles have shaped the arming of NSAs. Initial engagements between rebels and states usually highlighted the superior force of the latter, but because of states’ interests and constraints weapons and military technology have been leaking from states to NSAs by different methods.  A set of factors, political, social, cultural, technological and organizational, both facilitated and constrained NSAs’ ability to practise the four methods of arming, making it a dynamic  process. From the nineteenth century, NSAs have employed mainly external sources to acquire weapons rather than domestic sources because the technology of modern weapons is more difficult to improvise. Another dramatic development, dating from the second half of the twentieth century, is the intensive use of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) by armed NSAs, enabling them to reduce the power imbalance against the state. Present NSAs can easily acquire and ship weapons systems over long distances using the mechanisms of globalization. They are customers of the global illicit arms trade that integrates government and non-government actors, creating complicated structures, often beyond the control of national states. Still, arms smuggling remains a time-place-based challenge for NSAs, while governments improve their counter-smuggling skills. In the near future NSAs’ efforts to obtain weapons will dominate their conflicts against states.

Sam LowderFirst Year Writing HonorsProfessor Duneer15 November 2020Perpetual WeaponsTommy Orange’s There There is riddled with motifs that connect characters in more than just a literal, social sense.  When multiple characters are shown studying their reflections, for example, the reader realizes they share something on a deeper level, that no matter how different these peoples’ lives are, they all experience some of the same subconscious motivations. Further, an element of the story that ties not only the characters together, but the entire Native American community, is gun violence.  Throughout the entirety of his novel There There, Tommy Orange uses gun violence, specifically bullets, as a timeless symbol of corruption and hate in Native American communities; a theme that can be easily reflected in general American culture as an ever growing epidemic.Orange opens his book with a briefing on the genocide of Native Americans, explaining the brutal ways in which his anscestors were killed. One focus of this prologue is the introduction of firearms to America.  What used to be a peaceful country, not yet industrialized, was invaded by foreign technology, giving the Natives no chance to defend themselves.  “The bullets were premonitions, ghosts from dreams of a hard, fast future”; they “became the promise of what was to come, the speed and the killing, the hard, fast lines of borders and buildings”(Orange 10).  When Native communities were attacked by colonists with guns, it was the end of an era; nothing would ever be the same again.  The arrival of these bullets signified the beginning of industrialization, the execution of not only Native Americans, but of pure natureLowder 2and wildlife.  This tragedy is later demonstrated in the “conversation” depicted between Opal and her teddy bear, Two Shoes.  Two Shoes explains that white men have violently killed Native Americans and bears alike upon infiltrating their home with weapons: “sister, they slit all our throats,” he professes (Orange 51).Later on, the story’s interlude directly foreshadows the book’s ending by discussing ashooting that takes place at a powwow.  Orange writes that “a bullet is a thing so fast it’s hot andso hot it’s mean and so straight it moves clean through a body, makes a hole, tears, burns, exits,goes on, hungry, or it remains, cools, lodges, positions” (141).  Orange personifies these bulletsas if they have evil minds of their own, as if they are determined to thrust pain and suffering ontoanyone nearby.  These bullets are reckless machines without morals, they do not discriminateagainst children or the innocent, they just keep going. Therefore, it is implied that those whooperate guns, those who set these bullets free, are just as cruel and heartless as the senselesspieces of metal.  Additionally, as a possible reference back to the prologue, it is mentioned that“the bullets have been coming from miles. Years” (Orange 141).  Metaphorically,  these bulletscausing havoc at the modern powwow are the same ones that the colonists brought into thecountry centuries ago; they have one purpose and one purpose only: to kill mercilessly.Finally, the powwow Orange’s characters attend, the event earlier hinted at in theinterlude, acts as the finale of There There; it is what completely merges not only the characters’lives with one another, but the more informational segments of the novel with the plotline.  Thefirst “Big Oakland Powwow” was meant to symbolize that Native American culture still exists,that the characters are “a present tense people, modern, relevant, [and] alive,” yet, it abruptlyconcludes with its celebrants lying dead “in the grass [while] wearing feathers” (Orange 141).The only difference between this present day occurrence and the historical arrival of white menLowder 3to America is that at the powwow, a group of Native Americans were the ones to sabotage theirown culture.  The way in which this group of characters have adopted the violent role of thewhite colonists could easily be a reference to assimilation: a theme directly related to guns in theway that both have oppressed the Native American culture. Possibly, the most descriptive scenein this shooting is the final chapter in which the book’s focus shifts full circle, back to TonyLoneman.  Without a doubt, Tony’s body receives more bullets than anyone else’s as he strugglesto run towards Charles.  In a way parallel to the book’s very first description of mechanicalmassacre, Orange writes that “the bullet feels fast and hot in [Tony’s] leg even though he knowsthe bullet can’t be moving anymore” (286).  This repetition of describing the high speed andtemperature of the bullets throughout the entirety of the book solidifies the idea that nothing haschanged; even “assimilated,” “urban” Indians must face the same violence their ancestors oncedid.  Further, much like the personification of the bullets in the interlude, Tony feels “the hotheavy weight and speed of the bullets do[ing] their best to push him back, pull him down,”proving once again that Tommy Orange has the intent of making these weapons just asantagonistic as the people operating them (Orange 287).  These constant parallelisms, connectingthe events of the past to those of the present, symbolically illustrate that although timeprogresses, violence doesn’t end.  In fact, this specific element of Orange’s storytelling can bemirrored in the seemingly immortal second amendment of the United States Constitution.Even though it has been hundreds of years since the creation of the second amendment,the right to bear arms, the American government has not attempted to alter it, despite the fact thatguns are becoming increasingly more dangerous and deadly than they previously were in moreprimitive times.  As a matter of fact, this amendment was only created because “the men writingthe Bill of Rights wanted every citizen to be in the militia, and they wanted everyone in theLowder 4militia to be armed” (Shusterman).  The reasoning involved in the birth of this amendment wasbased on the fact that the United States did not have, or want, a professional full-time army ofsoldiers.  Additionally, “if someone was prohibited from participating in the militia, the leadersof the Founders’ generation would not have wanted them to have access to weapons”(Shusterman).  Presently, America actually has its own army full of voluntary soldiers, making itso that everyone does not have an obligation to physically get up and fight for the country atrandom, thus, rendering the second amendment irrelevant when considering its original purpose.If American citizens were to abide by the original intentions of this law, they would not be ableto own guns unless they took part in the U.S. army. But, of course, “as with all thingsconstitutional, Americans are adapting 18th-century laws to fit 21st-century lives” (Shusterman).The fact that the second amendment has not been altered since 1776 is quite shocking asmechanical weapons, just as any other technology, have been developed in ways that have made them more effective than ever before.  Unlike other machines, such as cars, guns last for an incredibly long time.  As Dr. Richard F. Corlin explains in a speech on the topic, many people already have old guns that work as any gun should, so in order to keep the industry running, manufacturers must create new and improved weapons at every chance they get.“These changes make guns better suited for crime, because they are easier to carry and more likely to kill or maim whether they are used intentionally or unintentionally” (Corlin).  Sadly, largely because of America’s refusal to set down its guns, shootings like the one in There There happen all too often.  Even worse is the fact that many of these tragedies could have been prevented with stricter gun laws.  For example, the United Kingdom managed to ban the possession of all handguns after one single school shooting in Scotland (Cooke).  Meanwhile, the U.S. government has yet to take any drastic action on the subject after years of mass shootings.Lowder 5As a matter of fact, the number of guns in the United States has only ever grown over time; as of2018, there are 120.5 guns per one hundred people living in America, which is more than doublethe amount in Yemen, the country holding the second-highest ratio of guns per hundred people:52.8 (BBC).  As of 2017, guns take part in 73 percent of all American homicides, while in thestricter United Kingdom, they take part in only three percent (BBC).  A statistic like this goes toshow that limiting the public’s access to guns actually does bring the majority of gun violence toa halt; even though some criminals may still have access to guns after a ban, it does more goodthan harm when looking at the big picture.With so much evidence in favor of stricter gun laws, one might think that more peoplewould stop glorifying the outdated second amendment, but this simply isn’t the case.  One reasonas to why this might be so is America’s fixation on threats unrelated to what hides within thecountry.  Ever since 9/11, terrorism has been viewed as one of the most lethal threats toAmerican citizens, when, in actuality, “nearly as many Americans will die [in any given month]from gun violence than died on 9/11” (Cohen).  For comparison, in the aftermath of 9/11, “theUnited States invaded two nations, spent trillions of dollars and reoriented the federalgovernment's national security footing toward the fight against terrorism,” yet, following yearsof gun violence, there may be discussion of togetherness and change, but no legal action beyondthe basic arrest of the offender is taken (Cohen). Undoubtedly, 9/11 was a horrible tragedy, butso was the Sandy Hook shooting, in which over 20 children were killed, so was the Las Vegasshooting, in which 58 people were massacred, and so was the Pulse Nightclub shooting, in which49 members of the LGBTQ community were targeted and murdered out of hate, to name only afew incidents (BBC).  Acts of terrorism from overseas and acts of terrorism from within theLowder 6United States itself bear the same dreadful results, so why won’t the government react in thesame logical way?One possible factor that may greatly contribute to the longevity of America’santi-gun-control attitude is that for many pro-gun citizens, the right to bear arms representspatriotism and freedom; they become defensive if they feel this element of their freedom is beingthreatened.  Yet, on the other hand, this idea of guns equaling “freedom” may be a cover up formen who experience thoughts of a more vulnerable nature. Psychoanalytical research suggeststhat one “motivation for the acquisition of guns as personal possessions has been attributed tofeelings of insecurity or to the need for a sense of control, mastery, or power” (Cooke).  In otherwords, unconfident men often feel as if possessing a gun grants them more masculinity,something valued greatly amongst males in American culture.  After decades of misogyny, menare afraid to be perceived as even slightly feminine, so they often go to great lengths and act inextreme ways as a means to be perceived by society as strong, powerful, and manly.  Thus, “theintroduction of regulatory gun control” “diminish[es], even threaten[s],” this “particular image offunctional masculinity” (Cooke).  Overall, for those who feel as if their life is out of their control,guns make them feel as if they have more power over their destiny.In relation to There There, could this yearning for control have been one of the factors thatdrove the group of robbers, Octavio in particular, toward gun violence?  After a brutal childhoodand the tragic death of his mother and brother in a car accident, Octavio must have felt defeated,as if he could do nothing to change his fate.  Growing up, he was exposed to a great amount ofviolence - often hiding from people with guns and other weapons - so it was most likely secondnature for him to view guns as tools that could get him what he wanted: money, and therefore,happiness.  Tommy Orange illustrates this idea in not only Octavio’s obsession with guns, butLowder 7also when describing his simplest actions.  Before using a literal gun to force Calvin to assist himin the robbery, “his eyes turned into bullets--he shot them around the room” (Orange 93).Octavio is ultimately a product of what his ancestors’ massacrists brought to the United States;the violence he faced all his life has transformed him into someone who needs guns to act.  It’sironic that Octavio somewhat represents the very weapons used to kill his forefathers, but evenmore ironically, Octavio is shot to death by the guns he himself 3D printed.  As a side note, thismetaphorical suicide even further elaborates on the United States’ gun issues, as approximatelysixty percent of gun deaths are accounted for by suicide (BBC).  Ultimately, Octavio is yetanother Native American casualty of the white man’s invasion of America.Although There There has many depressing undertones, Orange leaves many elements of his novel open-ended and somewhat filled with hope. One moment such as this takes place in the waiting room of the hospital after the powwow shooting, focusing on Opal, whose grandson, Orvil, had just been wounded.  The first line of this chapter is “Opal knows Orvil’s gonna make it,” and although it is followed by some doubt, Opal’s final appearance in the novel comes full circle when the doctor emerges from the hospital (284). It was previously mentioned that Opal has “good” and “bad” numbers, so when she counts the amount of times the door swings and it ends on number eight, a “good” number, the reader knows positive news must follow.  The reader is given the power to decide for themselves what happens to Orvil, as well as many of the other characters; the audience has the ability to change the outcome depending on their interpretation.  Similarly, America as a whole has the ability to change its own future, to prevent innocent children like Orvil from being killed, whether it be at a powwow or a more common battleground such as school.  In the same way that some of Orange’s characters were killed,Lowder 8many American citizens have already suffered from gun violence, but just as Orvil’s fate lies inthe reader’s hands, the fate of the United States lies in the hands of its subjects; there is still hope.Lowder 9Cohen, Michael A., “America’s Biggest National Security Threats Are At Home, Not Abroad.”World Politics Review (Selective Content).

The thesis works with hypothesis, that lighter ground forces are inherently disadvantaged, when they clash with heavier ground forces. While the thinkers of Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) count on light ground forces to serve in concert with air power, the air superiority needed might not always be available. To determine possible outcomes of clashes between light and heavy forces, the paper examines seven historical case studies of clashes between opponents with great armament disparity, looking for importance of armament disparity inside the cases, as well as comparing them between the cases. The set of case studies largely confirmed the hypothesis, proving the value of heavy ground forces in combat. However, it also found that other effects, primarily air support and use of terrain, can mitigate or completely counter the effect of armament disparity.

Tactical nuclear weapons remain among the least transparent elements of the nuclear arsenals of the major powers.

Sigma XI (Directorate of Technical Development Army Haquarters) There is little doubt that explosives had their origin in warfare. In  the armed conflict between groups of individuals or of states, where each sought and still seeks to impose its will upon the ot.her by force, it was inevitable that arms should grow and flourish. The sling, the bow and arrow, the sword and firearm typify evolution in warfare weapons. Bs a means of propelling missiles, the gun and gun powder were thought of. The history of explosives, therefore, may be said to begin with black powder. E'rom the voluminous and conflicting evidence before us, it is almost difficult to trace the black powder back to its origin. According to Halhead (1776) gunpowder has been known in India ' far teyond ,all periods of in- vestigation '. Tho other claimants are the Chinese, Greeks, ,4rabs, English and the Cemmns. With the great strides made by science from the fifties of the last century, progress in explosives also kept pace. .The discovery .of nitroglycerine in 1846 by Sobrero opened up new possibilities. This invention of nitroglycerine, however, remained undeveloped for a long time, excepting for minor use as a remedy for headache in diluted alcoholic solution under the name of glonoine. It is to the genius of Alfred Nobel (1833-96) that we owe the genesis, and development of explosives based on nitroglycerine. From 1859 onwards, Alfred and his father Emmanuel Nobel. busied themselves with experiments on N. G. Eventually in 1862 they erected a t  Eieleneborg, near Stockholm, a s m l l  plant where nitroglycerine was manufactured in small quantities. In the two years following, Nobel's efforts were mainly directed towards the introduction of his explosive, called the ' blasting oil ', into blasting practice. When these were beginning to look bright, the young manufacturer met with a severe reverse. In  1864 there was a terrific explosion at the plant, resulting in its complete destruction. Alfrbd's young brother Oscar Emil was killed in the explosion, while his father Emmanual Nobel was severely injured from which he never recoveretl, dying in 1872. The accident nude a deep impression upon the public and consequently cansed the Government to forbid the manufacture of nitroglycerine. But Alfred was undaunted, . . . . . . ' strong in will '. Alfred Nobel rented a boat and anchored i t  at Malrsee and continued his experiments, removed from dwellings, till he was rewarded icith the discovery of dynamite, although once again t,hrough an act of ' sependiarism '. The sheet metal cans containing nitroglycerine were packed in Kieselgnrh in order to protect them from shock and damage during transportation. When unpacking the cans, i t  was found that one of them had apparently lost a portion of its oil, an?l in this way Nobel discovered the absorbing capacity of Kiesel- gurh for Pr'. G. The capilliary action of the minute diatomaceous particles of the kieselgurh converts nitroglycerine into a cheesy, plastic mass, which hardly shows any exudatioq qnd is much more insensitive to shock tbau free N. G ,  26 DEFENCE SCIENCE JOURNAL 27 However, neither the freezing of I?. G., nor its absorption by kieselgurh made it entirely safe or efficient. It was soon discovered for instance, that N. G .  in dynamite could be displaced by water and therefore dynamite would be of little use for demolition purposes in water or in wet holes. Improve- ment over dynamite had to be erected, if N. G .  was to be used for blasting purposes. Nobel was revolving these problems in his mind, when chance again favoured him. It was a chance that only an active and alert mind could seize upon and utilise for the benefit of mankind. '4 small wound on Nobel was dressed with collodion. This gave him the idea of colloidising or gelatinising nitroglycerine with nitrocf;llulose. Thus arose blasting gelatine that was to be the premier demolition explosive of the world to-day. Its performance was efficient and perfect, as witnessed by the number of factories Nobel established in most countries on the Continent and in .Imerica for the manufacture of blasting gelatine. 'FIe thereby amass4 a big fortune most of which he bequeathed, as we all know, to  a trust for the establishment of five prizes, one of which is to be given to a person or society that renders p a t e s t  service to the cause of international brotherhood, in the supression or reduction of standing armies, or in the establishment or furtherance of peace Congress. We might. pause here for a while, contemplating this great genius and his munificent contributions towards promotion of universal brotherhood. NO less fascinating than the history of nitroglycerine is the history of nitrocellulose which begins in the gear 1833, When Bracannot first prepared nitrostamh under the name of xyloidine. In 1538, Pelouze found that xyloidine ignites a t  1803C, and burns with a very considerable violence. Paper treated with nitric acid was found to have similar combustible properties and Felouze believed that these properties might make such materials useful in artillery. ID 1845 Schonbein prepared for the first time Schiessbaumwalle i.e., guncotton from absorbent cotton. ?here is an amusing story on the discovery of guncotton by Schonbein. I t  appears that; Schonbein, like many other inventors, often used his wife's kitchen for his experiments. One day he was distilling nitric acid and sulphuric acid or! the kitchen stove, when the flask broke. He grabbed the neareat. thing, his wife's apron, which seemed none the worse for the treatment and hung it up to dry in front of the kitchen fire. Suddenly there was a pul? and the apron went up in flames. Being a true Scientist, although perhaps a cowardly husband, he repeated the experi- ment and.discovered that the treatment of cotton with a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids resulted in a highly inflammable compound but possessing the same physical appearance of the original cotton. _ Gunpowder, as already mentioned, was the propellant sine quo non till the rise of smokeloss powder, when it completely went out of the field. In considering development of modern propellank a e  have to refer to Robel's work again. In extension of his experiments on blasting gelatin% i.e., of gelatinising nitroglycerine with nitrocellulose, he increased the nitro- cellulose content and thus succeeded in producing a fairly horn-like colloid which co~lld no longer be detonated by a blasting cap, but proved to be a very suitable and powerful propellant on account of its slow combustion. After prolonged and inteneive research, he fixed upon 40% nitroglycerine and 60% nitrocellulose (part of it guncotton) as the most suitable composition and called it ballistite (1888). This discovery was the most outstanding of the time in the sense that $wo of the most brisant and sensitive of the explosives in their free state, from being bad masters became good servants in the cause of mankind. Almost simultaneously, Abel acd Dewar discovered that nitroglycerine and guncotton could be better plasticised with the use of acetone. The dough, thus obtained, they caused to be pressed out into sticks or cords, known there- after as cordite. The first of tohis series i s  cordite Mk. 1, introduced by the British Government. In the South African War, it first came to notice that cardite Mk. 1 was highly eroding to the gun barrels, which was traced to the excessive heat produced by the large amount of nitroglycerine (88%) in the cordite. A modification, under the name cordite M. D., with added mineral jelly and nitroglycerine reduced to 30%, was found to overcome the defect and became so popular with the British Services that the largest industrial venture of the 1914-18 War in Grest Britain was the (Propellant) faetory a t  Gretna, its acid- prod-acing capacity exceeding that of the whole country before the war. To improve further upon cordite M.D. the War Office and the Admiralty, after the first Great War, initiated researches into producing a propellant that would be free from flash and smoke. These researches resulted in cordite which contains oarbamite as stabiliser, in place of mineral jelly of the M. D. cordite. Cordite W is superior to cordite M. D. in stability. The Navy uses cordite S.C.,-no solvenfs are used in its manufacture. In recent times further improvements have been effected, and we have now a great variety of cordites such as, cordite, TV.B1., A, N, hW, I,, NQ, etc., and are available in different sizes and shapes. In U.S.A., on the other hand, nitrocellulose powders in different forms, suitably stabilised, are the standard propellants. Thus N.C.T. is nitrocellulose tubular stabilized with diphenylamine, while the Dupont powder is nitrocellulose coated with dinitrotoluene and graphite. These powders do not contain nitroglycerine. The nitrocellulose powders are generally hygroscopic, causing variation in ballistics and are not so stable in storage as cordite ; they are rather bulky and burn more slowly and more uniformly than cordite and cause less erosion.

novel weapons hypothesis,77599855,Weapon of choice: small arms and the culture of military innovation,,"Ford, Matthew",2017,"This book examines Western military technological innovation through the lens of developments in small arms during the twentieth century. These weapons have existed for centuries, appear to have matured only incrementally and might seem unlikely technologies for investigating the trajectory of military-technical change. Their relative simplicity, however, makes it easy to use them to map patterns of innovation within the military-industrial complex. Advanced technologies may have captured the military imagination, offering the possibility of clean and decisive outcomes, but it is the low technologies of the infantryman that can help us develop an appreciation for the dynamics of military-technical change. Tracing the path of innovation from battlefield to back office, and from industry to alliance partner, Ford develops insights into the way that small arms are socially constructed. He thereby exposes the mechanics of power across the military-industrial complex. This in turn reveals that shifting power relations between soldiers and scientists, bureaucrats and engineers, have allowed the private sector to exploit infantry status anxiety and shape soldier weapon preferences. Ford's analysis allows us to draw wider conclusions about how military innovation works and what social factors frame Western military purchasing policy, from small arms to more sophisticated and expensive weapons",,"HM0846, T0173.2, U021, U027, U150, U161, U164, U799, UD157, UD330, UD380","HM0846, T0173.2, U021, U027, U150, U161, U164, U799, UD157, UD330, UD380",,'Oxford University Press (OUP)'
novel weapons hypothesis,56452,New Proposal for the Detection of Concealed Weapons:  Electromagnetic Weapon Detection for Open Areas,,"Agurto Goya, Alan",,"Terrorist groups, hijackers, and people hiding guns and knifes are a constant and increasing threat Concealed weapon detection (CWO) has turned into one of the greatest challenges facing the law enforcement community today. Current screening procedures for detecting concealed weapons such as handguns and knives are common in controlled access settings such as airports, entrances to sensitive buildings and public events. Unfortunately screening people in this way prior to entering controlled areas is ineffective in preventing some weapons from getting through and also produces bottle-necks in crowded environments.

The local aberrations in the magnetic field produced by ferromagneguns and knives can be detected by extremely senin development, which are called Gradiometer Metal Detectors [2].  The gradiometer metal detector system is a passive system and has called differential mode. The gradiometer responds to changes in the local magnetic field of the earth caused by a moving ferromagnetic object.

When concealed metals are encountered, its time-decay signature can be compared to those in the library and, if a match is found, the object can potentially be classified [8].     There are two broad categories of EM induction approaches for CWD, by the type of mContinuous wave (CW).

It is known netic field is in the horizontal magnetic feature, we create a practical approximation of an infinitive sheet current by placing closely spaced current-carrying wires in a plane (See illustration of three 3HMF in Figure 2.6). The result is a magnetic field with a relatively uniform horizontal shape.    To better understanding the above concept basic physics need to be rethat, for an infinitive conducting sheet current in free space, the magdirection perpendicular to the sheet current. Thus the sheet current is a field (HMF) generator or antenna. This magnetic field is constant. To take advantage of this  20To conceptualize the 3DSMF sensor, we need only to imagine two single-axes HMF antenna co-located at right angles to each other.

Pulse Control Circuit.  66 67The proposed weapon detection system needs to cover a larger area. To accomplish that an option could be to use a single UMFG with a longer wire; however doing this maximizes the magnetic field collapse time, inducing weaker eddy currents in the metal and making detection difficult. In the time domain, the strength of the excitation magnetic field is dependent of rate of change of its collapse time. The decay of the excitation magnetic field is governed by the decay of the current in the wires after the switch is opened. Thus a way to use a longer wire in which currents decays in a short time needs to be found.   Ignoring capacitive effects, the decay time on the UMFG is given by L/R, where L is the inductance of the loop and R is the resistance of the loop. For this application, L can be minimized using several shorter loops. L decreases more than R so the reduction of R does not prevent the minimization of the time decay.  For the proposed weapon detection it is planned to use five of UMFG (144mx5) connected in parallel as shown in Figure 4.11 with sensor arrays in between to cover an area of 3x3 m. This block area could be used as a module for a larger system. In the whole system each UMFG has its own switch because each UMFG will be excited sequentially as shown in Figure 4.12 by a pulse controller. It improves the detection by giving location of the target and avoiding exciting other metal in the vicinity.

Improvement in target classification  The advantages of exciting an unknown metal with uniform magnetic field can be better explained by a description of the basic physics of the problem. Consider a simplified odel made of two separated dipoles as shown in Figure 4.14. Each dipole e constant is modelled as a single exponential decay and the sume decays is the target’s decay signature. Dipole 1 has a decay tim τ  and amplitude A a  and dipole 2 has a decay time constant bτ  and amplitude A b . This signature is an inherent property of the target and is used for classification. Now let’s consider the case as showed in Figure 4.14a, where exciting the target with a spatially varying (non-uniform) magnetic field that excites the two dipoles with different magnetic fields, B1 and B 2 , the target signature is dependent on the excitation field and is not simply the sum of two exponential decays. This potentially makes target classification more difficult. In Figure 4.14b, the excitation magnetic field is uniform (B u ) over the target. In this case the theoretical response of the target is preserved because the magnetic field can be factored out of the target response equation. So target signal expression still contains endent of the strength of the uniform magnetic field.    Figure 4.14.

Looking on table 4.1 there are plenty of magnetic field sensor technologies which can cope with this requirement [46].

The model consists of a UMFG (20 parallel cables laid on the floor, 3cm in between) for transmitting step pulse of current of 10A, 1.5ms width pulse, falling time 170us, causing eddy currents to flow in a nearby metal object. The eddy currents scatter a signal that will be detected by a three-axis magnetic sensor array (hall or magneto-resistive sensors) placed between the cables. Parameter values used in the model are based on previous studies and simulations performed to achieve a strong enough magnetic field. Simulations have been run to analyse the sensitivity/insensitivity of the target response to changes in shapes, orientation, sizes  and material composition of interrogated objects. A study of target response at different stand off is also included. 4.4.1 Sensitivity to outer shape  Four different samples: Gun1 with smooth barrel and smooth bore, Gun2 with square barrel and smooth bore, and two knives with different cross section as showed in Figure 4.20 are tested respectively. In Figure 4.22, the magnetic flux density (B) along z-axis and y-axis is sensed from a distance of 35cm from the object along perpendicular line between object and floor. Following the intended algorithm for time constant extraction, the logarithm of magnetic flux density is plotted against time in order to show more clearly the time constant for each interrogated object. and performs the signal processing for the detection and classification.

Results showed that even if the amplitude of the signal changes, the time of decay stays invariant. Also measurements have been taken at different distance from the gun (15cm and 35cm as shown in Figure 4.24) to show how the time constant is independent of the strength of the field incident.

In this test a coil is added to the model to sense the time decay of induced current in the target caused by the abrupt change of the magnetic field. Results in Figure 4.25 show that time constant is a function size of the sample. Because large metallic objects store more energy than small ones, the time decay of collapsing magnetic field (or induced current in the coil) takes longer. This characteristic could be potentially used to discriminate object size.    Figure 4.25. Model to test size sensitivity.  831 1.05 1.1 1.15 1.2x 10-310-3 ng the aterial  Figure 4.26.

Gradient of target signals response at different stand off.    From Figure 4.29 and 4.30 it can be seen that even though amplitude of the signal response changes at different stand off, the time constant remains invariant. This simulation proves that time constant is independent of the strength of illuminating and scattering magnetic field.   Tests have shown that time decay measurements obtained from simulations of the proposed weapon detection system are sensitive to the shape, size, and material composition of the target. Furthermore, the time decay profile is independent of the strength of the illuminating magnetic field. Measurements taken in any direction also sho  an agreement in time decay profile. All the mentioned are requirements of a comprehensive CWD system, so the results look promising in terms of effectiveness and reduction of false alarm level.  w 87 884.5 Experimental Work  4.5.1 Driver circuit for UMFG ve the detection the UMFG needs to induce eddy currents in the target with sufficient strength to generate magnetic fields strong enough to be measured by sensors. UMFG has to excite the target with a magnetic field with strength and rate of change high enough to sense distance targets and induce strong eddy currents. Thus UMFG needs to carry enough current and switch faster to meet those requirements. Based on FE simulations the UMFG needs to carry a current 6~10A and switch in around 250us to induce strong enough eddy currents in the target such that the magnetic field  back to the sensors is in the order of T To improμ . A driver circuit for the UMFG consists of a MOSFET IRF150 that can carry the required current and a step pulse generator to switch the MOSFET at a frequency adjusted to the acquisition and signal processing time of  available hardware (in this research the frequency used is 20Hz). Figure 4.31 shows the first design for the driver of the UMFG. The pulse generator (low power circuelectrically decoupled by an opto-isolator to prevent electrical failures. The pulse generator     it) and the MOSFET (high power circuit) connected to the UMFG are consists of timer LM555 set at 20Hz, 10% duty cycle in order to not overheat the wires.

Experimental tests were developed on an UMFG (3 m x 0.60 m) placing metallic objects at 30 cm over the centre of the UMFG plane and reading the measurement of sensors placed   over the plane and below the targets. The tests were performed in an environment under EM interference (electronic equipments) and noise (nearby metallic objects in theillumination area) to resemble the worst working scenario of the proposed CWD system.  • Metallic target response in search coils.  ed using a search coil device as showed in Figure 4.37.evice allows choosing three loops arrangements.

From Figure 4.38 it can be seen that target response for each position (blue curves) has similar transient profile. A zoomed view of curves (Figure 4.39), plotted in logarithmic scale, shows a first part of the transient (500-560 s Figure 4.39. Zoomed views of solderμ ) dominated by target signals with linear profile. The second part of the transient (after 560 sμ ) shows coupled EM interference which is dominant because the target has already released most of the stored energy. Gradient of the curves in first part of the transient correspond to time constant which is similar for the threes positions. It probes the insensitivity of time constant to target orientation.    Second test: sensitivity of time constant to target shape  In this test, the response of samples with differentiated geometry characteristics (a base of solder kit, a mobile, and three pliers) is analysed. Measurements were taken at 30cm over the UMFG. Search coil responses are plotted in Figure 4.40(top).

Like first test the zoomed view of curves (Figure 4.40(bottom)), plotted in logarithmic scale, shows a first part of the transient (500-550 sμ ) dominated by target signals with linear profile and a dominant EM interference in the rest of the transient. Now gradients of the curves in first part of the transient are remarkably different, which allow classifying samples.  Thus this test probes the sensitivity of time constant to target shapes.   • Metallic target response in magnetoresistive sensors  Anisotropic Magnetoresistive (AMR) sensors convert magnetic fields to a differential output voltage, capable of sensing magnetic fields as low as 30 μ gauss. Most low field magnetic sensors are affected by large magnetic disturbing fields (>4~20 gauss) that may lead to output signals degradation. In order to reduce this effect, and maximize the signal output, a magnetic switching technique can be applied to the AMR bridge that eliminates the effect of past magnetic history [47]. The circuit in Figure 4.41 is the implementation of the switching technique to maximize sensitivity of AMR before UMFG illuminates the target. The circuit operates sending master pulsed signal of 14.5Hz, 9.88% duty cycle (first LM555 working as astable) to drive a pulsed current of 4A through P and N Darlington into the AMR coils. This pulsed current realigns magnetic domains of the permalloy film on each set and reset increasing the sensitivity. The master pulsed signal also pass through diodes, resistor, inverters and trigger the second LM555 (working as mono stable, 10ms output time) to produce delay before switch off the UMFG and excite the target. This circuit eliminate all past magnetic history of the sensor just before start the measurements.

The different transient profile of each sample can be observed m re clearly from zoomed plot (Figure 4.44).

Close up of Time decay profile of metallic objects using AMR HMC1001.   1024.6 Conclusions   A new proposal CWD has been proposed based on information contained in the scattered magnetic field from objects illuminated by a low frequency magnetic field. Information regarding physical characteristics, size and material composition of metallic object can be extracted from one of the parameters of the scatter signal: the time constant of the decaying magnetic field induced in the object after step excitation.  The system design discussed and proposed in the second and third part of this chapter can serve as foundation for further development of the proposed CWD.   FEA simulations have shown that time decay are sensitive to the shape, size, and material composition of the target. Furthermore, the time decay profile is independent of the strength of the illuminating magnetic field. Measurements taken in any direction also show an agreement in time decay profile. All the mentioned are requirements of a comprehensive CWD system, so the results look ising in terms of effectiveness and reduction of false alarm Two sensor technologies were chosen to test the feasibility of the proposed CWD system. Signals picked up from search coil and magnetoresistive sensor (AMR) technologies showed sensitivity to shapes and insensitivity to orientation of metallic objects. Measurements were taken in an environment full of electronic equipments where noise and EM interference were present.  Search coils showed less immunity to those effects comparable to those in AMR. AMR sensors could provide more space resolution detection than search coils because of the small size however it can be achieved at cost of complexity in the circuitry (i.e. switching circuit, signal conditioning, etc). More investigation is need with sensor technologies to provide high resolution and low cost solution for the proposed CWD.        prom level.

The most prominentmanifestation of its “revolutionary” character is the fact that airpower pro-vides commanders with a relatively easy method of penetrating physically theenemy’s defensive system and delivering firepower—in abstract terms, of con-ducting power projection.1Wei: Research & DebatePublished by U.S. Naval War College Digital Commons, 20081 3 4 N A V A L W A R C O L L E G E R E V I E WAs aviation (and space) weaponry of all kinds developed, air-defense systemsevolved as well, from “barrage balloons” to surface-to-air missiles, from pointair defense to area air defense, all the way up to today’s out-of-area interceptiontechnology. From a historical perspective, and in terms of the interaction be-tween offensive and defensive systems, changes in “delivery methods” of fire-power can be understood as simply the continuous evolution of thecost-effectiveness ratio. During World War II, vast numbers of bombers, “FlyingFortresses,” covered the sky over strategic nodes of the Axis powers. During theKorean War, bombers confronted newly developed jet-propelled interceptor air-craft, and the high cost-effectiveness of this mode of delivery became difficult tosustain. Until the Vietnam War, the United States possessed absolute air superi-ority; then, however, facing surface-to-air missiles, it often exchanged the mis-sions of tactical aircraft and heavy bombers, employing F-105 fighter-bombersto attack targets deep within enemy territory while relying on B-52 strategicbombers for support missions on the battlefield and against forward positions.During the Persian Gulf War, coalition strikes against deep targets were all un-dertaken by tactical aircraft—for example, by the F-117A stealth fighter, whichcarries only two laser-guided bombs. It is important to note that since the Ko-rean War, the majority of wars involving great powers like the United States havebeen of medium or low intensity, so their combat systems have been used in rela-tively benign environments.Cruise missiles and ballistic missiles, both of which appeared in the finalstage of World War II, possess even stronger capabilities than existing types oftactical aircraft for penetration of the enemy’s defensive space, and at an evenbetter cost-effectiveness ratio. Ballistic missiles, given the same tactical param-eters, offer more outstanding penetration capability and cost-effectivenessthan cruise missiles.One of the reasons that numerous third-world countries favor tactical ballis-tic missiles is that because of their limitations, they are generally at a significantdisadvantage in confrontations with great powers. Under such circumstances,how to guarantee penetration of the enemy’s defense space is the first problem tobe solved. By means of ballistic missiles, an actor inferior in combat aircraftcan deliver firepower against a dominant actor. From the economic point ofview, developing an effective air force is very complex and requires a long ges-tation period. A substantial deterrent using tactical ballistic missiles takes farfewer resources; it is a “short-term investment” that can produce instant re-sults. The effect is similar to that of crossbows against knights in medieval Eu-rope—and today, as with the “Law Forbidding Crossbows,” developed Westerncountries impose tight restrictions on tactical missiles and related technology.2Naval War College Review, Vol. 61 [2008], No. 3, Art. 8https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/nwc-review/vol61/iss3/8W A N G W E I 1 3 5TACTICAL BALLISTIC MISSILES UNDER THE DOCTRINE OFLAND-BASED SEA CONTROLSimply put, the emergence of tactical ballistic missiles (TBMs) has enabledweaker parties to offset to a certain extent the effectiveness of the expensive aircombat systems of stronger opponents at a relatively low cost. However, theTBM alone cannot fundamentally change the superior and inferior positions ofthe two sides. During the Persian Gulf War, coalition air forces flew more than112,000 sorties, dropping 225,500 bombs; during the Kosovo war, NATO forcesflew thirty-five thousand sorties and dropped twenty-five thousand bombs;during the war in Afghanistan, U.S., British, and other allied forces dropped a to-tal of about 17,400 bombs. From the perspective of the cost-effectiveness ratio, itis hard to imagine that TBMs could deliver firepower on the same scale. But theweapon often makes a significant difference for the weak forces of a small coun-try against the integrated combat systems of a great power.At the tactical level, the value of medium- and short-range TBMs—presentlyone of China’s principal means of delivering long-range firepower—lies in theirability to penetrate enemy defense systems without placing high demands on thetactical environment. When we broaden our discussion to encompass the strate-gic level, however, the value of tactical missiles must be restated in this way: theyprovide China with more maneuvering space for military and political strategicoperations on its eastern, maritime flank.First, let us examine the Taiwan Strait. At the most comprehensive level,China’s Taiwan strategy is at present one of building up reserves rather thanpreparation. The core of this effort consists in strategic resource accumulationand geopolitical positioning. The specific goals are to avoid a situation in whichthe Taiwanese authorities go too far toward independence and to curtail gradu-ally their political room for maneuver, thus laying the foundation for futureunification.To maintain the current trend of stability in the strait area, it is necessary forthe central government to maintain a certain amount of military pressureagainst separatist forces, in addition to various political and diplomatic mea-sures, to deter behavior that “crosses the line or oversteps the boundary.” Thus,TBMs offer the mainland strategy toward Taiwan a third option, aside fromall-out use of force or reliance on nonmilitary means. That third choice, “attack-ing without entering,” represents a critical military way of exerting pressure onTaiwan. It creates greater decision-making space for the mainland with respectto Taiwan, while compressing the available space for the Taiwanese regime andgreatly reducing its options. Put more concretely, ballistic missiles provide thetools by which a “quasi-war” scenario can be made feasible. First, the tacticalmissile’s strong penetration capability can guarantee a high probability of3Wei: Research & DebatePublished by U.S. Naval War College Digital Commons, 2008success without a large-scale, high-intensity attack on the island itself, evenagainst a fairly intact air-defense system. After all, the effectiveness gap betweenmissile and antimissile technologies is much greater than that between aircraftand air-defense technologies. With respect to long-range firepower, the twosides of the Taiwan Strait are simply not comparable; the mainland occupies anabsolute and asymmetrically dominant position. Moreover, missiles essentiallypreclude engagements between personnel, thus giving the mainland control ofmilitary action as well as of corresponding political effects. An additional effectcomes into play on the political level. Over a long period of time, deployment ofmedium- and short-range TBMs along the mainland coast has had a significantpsychological impact on the Taiwanese public. Variations in the number of mis-siles deployed have become an indirect means of exerting influence upon the is-land’s internal political situation.In the longer term, should the mainland have no alternative but the use offorce in order to recover Taiwan, it will not be possible to neglect the possibilityof intervention by foreign militaries. Therefore, it will be necessary to undertakestrategic deployments in advance, in order to minimize the likelihood as well asthe intensity of any such intervention.Unlike tactical aircraft, cruise missiles, or other such delivery platforms, bal-listic missiles cannot be intercepted by the enemy’s air force. For an island na-tion, such as Japan, the most practical method to increase the depth of defensivespace is deploying sea-based missile interceptor systems in coastal waters.Against the threat of medium-range ballistic missiles from the Chinese main-land, however, what is needed is not a few “Aegis” air-defense ships but a com-plete naval combat system—just as China has developed a complete attacksystem. The maneuver and deployment of tactical missiles on home territorycauses China few military or political problems, whereas, in addition to their re-taliatory value, they pose a “clear and present threat” that keeps enemy naval de-ployments in check.From a broader, regional perspective, in fact, stabilization of the U.S.-Chineserelationship depends to some extent on China’s deployment of long-range fire-power, including TBMs. The three “island chains” form an important compo-nent of U.S. national strategy in the western Pacific; they all serve to obstruct theChinese navy’s routes into the open ocean, thus restricting its scope of opera-tions to a narrow area. From a purely military perspective, the ideal forward po-sition of U.S. forces should be the “second island chain.” There they can avoiddirect contact with Chinese forces while relying on the superiority of U.S.long-range striking power, thereby containing China more effectively. However,it is quite obvious that the United States would not be able to pull back so far inthe short run—the Korean Peninsula, the Diaoyu [Senkaku] Islands, Taiwan,1 3 6 N A V A L W A R C O L L E G E R E V I E W4Naval War College Review, Vol. 61 [2008], No. 3, Art. 8https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/nwc-review/vol61/iss3/8and other regions of the “first island chain” are all in very unsettled phases intheir histories. In the absence of any strategic breathing space, were the UnitedStates rashly to withdraw its forces from these places, chaos would surely ensue,and effective control might well be forfeited.Having in mind the technological disparities in any potential Sino-Americanconflict, China’s primary concern with regard to long-range firepower deliverymust be the penetration capability of its delivery platforms against U.S. defensesystems, not cost-benefit calculations. If one again considers grand strategy, war,from China’s point of view, would be an unfortunate instrument of last resort,not one by which China can pursue interests beyond its fundamental interests;therefore China’s understanding of cost-effectiveness would not be the same asthat of the United States. For that reason, the TBM plays the important role itdoes: as long as China possesses sufficient capability for long-range firepowerdelivery, in any outbreak of hostilities between China and the United States theTBM would make the American bases spread out along the first island chain“chopping blocks” for China’s firepower and increase the costs to the UnitedStates of a war enormously. U.S. war calculations are made according to “cost ac-counting”; in reality, however, American forces based along the first island chainhave become unwilling hostages in the strategic chess match between China andthe United States.The result is that for a very long time, in the western Pacific and even else-where, China and the United States have significantly lowered the chances ofconflict, though they view each other with great anxiety. Also, in an era of peace,the island-chains containment strategy has in fact little practical effect in im-peding China’s development—and for China at the present stage, nothing ismore important than a stable environment for development.FUNDAMENTALS OF TACTICAL BALLISTIC MISSILE STRIKESAGAINST SEA TARGETSReports to the effect that “the Chinese armed forces are exploring ballistic mis-sile attacks against aircraft carriers” have surfaced time and again in the media.Therefore, it is necessary to explain in simple terms the technical aspects of thisquestion. This article does not seek to prove or predict anything; the authorwishes only to discuss the feasibility of TBM attacks against moving targets onthe surface of the ocean, from a nonspecialist perspective.Suppose ballistic missiles are flying toward a formation of surface ships (letus tentatively defer the question of whether the missiles will hit or not). Alsosuppose that in response the vessels attempt to intercept them. Beyond doubt,the probability of successful interception, even if not zero, will certainly be farless than it would be of intercepting either aircraft or cruise missiles, since, asW A N G W E I 1 3 75Wei: Research & DebatePublished by U.S. Naval War College Digital Commons, 2008stated previously, the ballistic missile has a greater penetration capability againstarea-defense systems.The next question is whether ballistic missiles are capable of hitting movingsurface ships. The current conventional wisdom, on the Internet and in othermedia outlets, generally holds that as ballistic missiles were originally designedto attack fixed targets on land, moving targets on water greatly increase the tech-nical difficulties. But in reality, it is hard to make a straightforward comparison.First, the maximum speed of current large or medium-sized surface ships isaround thirty knots. Compared to that of ballistic missiles, which travel at manytimes the speed of sound, up to Mach 10 and beyond, the mobility of surfaceships is very limited. At least, ballistic missiles striking targets at sea seems morereasonable than ground-based missile-defense systems intercepting incomingmissiles. As the latter have achieved some important milestones, it can be as-sumed that developing ballistic missiles for deployment against targets at seawould require merely reintegration of specific technologies, not a quantum leapin the overall technological level.Second, surface targets on water contrast more sharply against their back-ground and are much easier to locate than targets in complex terrain or “hardtargets” underground. Finally, compared with ground-based weapon systemsthat can be deployed in a dispersed arrangement, surface ships are highly inte-grated platforms, and this means that their survivability in combat is lower.Thus, while it is difficult to imagine one or two conventionally armed guidedmissiles paralyzing an air base, the same firepower delivered against an aircraftcarrier could easily cost it the ability to launch and recover aircraft. Admittedly,from a systems perspective, evaluating the cost-effectiveness of ballistic missilesused against surface ships, if technology permits it, will not be so clear-cut.From an engineering standpoint, the key to ballistic missile strikes againsttargets at sea lies, in the author’s opinion, in the preparation of the maritime bat-tlefield. That is to say, a prerequisite of attacks against mobile targets is solvingsuch problems as precise reconnaissance and positioning, data exchange, etc.Preparation of the maritime battlefield will require marine surveillance satel-lites, electronic reconnaissance satellites, imaging reconnaissance satellites,communication satellites, and other space-based systems; airborne early warn-ing aircraft, unmanned reconnaissance aircraft, and other airborne systems; andshore-based over-the-horizon radars, underwater sonar arrays, and the like.These systems must be viewed as a “public investment”—parts of a comprehen-sive naval combat system.Between the launch of a ballistic missile and impact, there is an interval dur-ing which targeted vessels may attempt to escape. The flight of a ballistic missilewith a range of 1,500 kilometers, for example, takes eight to ten minutes; in that1 3 8 N A V A L W A R C O L L E G E R E V I E W6Naval War College Review, Vol. 61 [2008], No. 3, Art. 8https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/nwc-review/vol61/iss3/8time a surface target, if its speed is thirty knots, can move about three nauticalmiles. Therefore, to ensure that the ballistic missile hits its target, its trajectoryneeds to be adjusted in flight. Certain ballistic missiles, such as the Russian SS-27Topol-M, already employ various technologies to maneuver in space. These ma-neuvers, however, are preprogrammed attempts to evade enemy interception;they are not the type of course adjustment we are discussing here. However, ac-cording to public reports, China’s “Shenzhou” spacecraft successfully carriedout orbital adjustments during its experimental flights. Therefore, we can as-sume that for China there will be no technological bottlenecks in controlled ma-neuvers for ballistic missiles in space.Alternatively, midcourse-phase course-correction data can be fed to a missilefrom an external source—what is known as command guidance. Or, the missilecan carry its own radar or other sensors to detect the target from high altitudeand provide trajectory-correction information.Reentry-phase guidance, such as air rudders, microrocket motors, and otherterminal-phase guidance technologies, has been used since the “Pershing” mis-sile developed during the Cold War era. TBMs currently in Chinese service alsouse this kind of technology. Thus, it can be assumed that technical problemswith respect to the missile itself are not insurmountable. Moreover, it might bepossible, following reentry into the atmosphere, to reduce the speed of the war-head in order to adjust its trajectory. Alternatively, multiple missiles may be em-ployed in “precision firepower coverage” tactics against escape routes.It is not the purpose of this article to solve engineering and technical prob-lems. The above discussion is simply to make clear what follows, with regard tonaval combat systems—that a TBM maritime strike system will give the Chinesemilitary an asymmetrical means of firepower delivery in any future conflict atsea. Developments in antimissile technology have reached such a point that bal-listic missiles are no longer absolutely impossible to resist. But at the same time,in any actual confrontation the unequal effectiveness of offensive and defensivesystems gives the ballistic missile an advantage. However, tactical ballistic mis-siles cannot replace aircraft carriers, submarines, and other traditional navalweapons. The major difference is like that between “special forces” and “regularforces”—ballistic missiles can be used to destroy enemy forces at sea but not toachieve absolute sea control, let alone to project maritime power.Let us now return to the strategic level. The relative impacts of military sys-tems on the outcome of a conflict generally become more obvious as the conflictintensifies. Employing the J-7 aircraft or even the J-6 to counter F-14s andFA-18s may not be a problem during peacetime, but in a life-or-death situation,the qualitative discrepancies could bring disastrous consequences.

The results of this study show that international and local partners are all involved in the proliferation of illegal firearms in Nigeria, making it impossible for the government to control the proliferation of small arms and light weapons. The study also shows that the fight against the proliferation of small arms and light weapons in Nigeria is slowing due to the nature of the people involved in the proliferation of small arms and light weapons in Nigeria, as well as the limited capacities of the Nigerian states due to a lack of political will to curb the countrys growing insecurity.

Here, we test the hypothesis that the development of extra-somatic weapons could have influenced the evolution of human cooperative behaviour, thus providing a new explanation for these two puzzles. Widespread weapons use could have made disputes within hominin groups far more lethal and also equalized power between individuals. In such a cultural niche non-cooperators might well have become involved in such lethal disputes at a higher frequency than cooperators, thereby increasing the relative fitness of genes associated with cooperative behaviour. We employ two versions of the evolutionary Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma (IPD) model – one where weapons use is simulated and one where it is not. We then measured the performance of 25 IPD strategies to evaluate the effects of weapons use on them. We found that cooperative strategies performed significantly better, and non-cooperative strategies significantly worse, under simulated weapons use. Importantly, the performance of an ‘Always Cooperate ’ IPD strategy, equivalent to that of ‘strong reciprocity’, improved significantly more than that of all other cooperative strategies. We conclude that the development of extra-somatic weapons throws new light on the evolution of human altruistic and cooperative behaviour, and particularly ‘strong reciprocity’. The notion that distinctively human altruism and cooperation could have been an adaptive trait in a past environment that is no longer evident in the modern world provides a nove",,text,,,

There are currently an estimated 640 million small arms and light weapons in circulation – from handguns and assault rifles to shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles. The majority of this arsenal, or about 60%, is in the hands of civilians. A further seven to eight million new weapons are added to the global stockpile every year, as well as at least 10 billion units of ammunition. Guns are light, cheap, durable, easy to conceal and easy to operate, and therefore pose a pernicious threat to human security in countries at war and at peace alike.While landmines kill or maim between 15 and 20,000 people a year,during the same time the use and misuse of small arms and light weapons take between 200,000 and 270,000 lives in countries ‘at peace’ alone through homicide and suicide – up to five times more, depending on estimates, than die directly from gunfire in situations of war. The number of war wounded and disabled ranges anywhere from two to thirteen times the number killed. The economic cost of this violence is staggering, and it is now well recognised that armed insecurity poses a grave threat to sustainable development.

While for more than a century, biologists have proposed this organismal feature to play an important role in evolution and the origin of novelty, the idea has remained contentious. Plasticity is found in all domains of life, but only recently has there been an increase in empirical studies. This contribution is intended as a fresh view and will discuss current and future challenges of plasticity research, and the need to identify associated molecular mechanisms. After a brief summary of conceptual, theoretical, and historical aspects, some of which were responsible for confusion and contention, I will formulate three major research directions and predictions for the role of plasticity as a facilitator of novelty. These predictions result in a four-step model that, when properly filled with molecular mechanisms, will reveal plasticity as a major factor of evolution.

This broad approach may simplify experimental designs, increase their statistical power, and allow a more inclusive estimation of the extent of phenotypic plasticity in natural populations.

New hypotheses for how phenotypically plastic traits interact during development and selection,10.1111/evo.14464,"Nielsen, Matthew E., Papaj, Daniel R.",2022,"Organisms can often respond adaptively to a change in their environment through phenotypic plasticity in multiple traits, a phenomenon termed as multivariate plasticity. These different plastic responses could interact and affect each other's development as well as selection on each other, but the causes and consequences of these interactions have received relatively little attention. Here, we propose a new conceptual framework for understanding how different plastic responses can affect each other's development and why organisms should have multiple plastic responses. A plastic change in one trait could alter the phenotype of a second plastic trait by changing either the cue received by the organism (cue-mediated effect) or the response to that cue (response-mediated effect). Multivariate plasticity could benefit the organism either because the plastic responses work better when expressed together (synergy) or because each response is more effective under different environmental circumstances (complementarity). We illustrate these hypotheses with case studies, focusing on interactions between behavior and morphology, plastic traits that differ in their reversibility. Future empirical and theoretical research should investigate the consequences of these interactions for additional factors important for the evolution of plasticity, such as the limits and costs of plasticity.Open access articleThis item from the UA Faculty Publications collection is made available by the University of Arizona with support from the University of Arizona Libraries.

phenotypic plasticity hypothesis,103971417,REVIEW Open Access Plasticity as a developing trait: exploring the implications,,Marco Del Giudice,2014,"Individual differences in plasticity have been classically framed as genotype-by-environment interactions, with different genotypes showing different reaction norms in response to environmental conditions. However, research has shown that early experience can be a critical factor in shaping an individual’s plasticity to later environmental factors. In other words, plasticity itself can be investigated as a developing trait that reflects the combined action of an individual’s genes and previous interactions with the environment. In this paper I explore some implications of the idea that the early environment modulates long-term plasticity, with an emphasis on plasticity in behavioral traits. I begin by focusing on the mechanisms that mediate plasticity at the proximate level, and discussing the possibility that some traits may work as generalized mediators of plasticity by affecting the sensitivity of multiple phenol types across developmental contexts. I then tackle the complex problem of the evolution of reaction norms for plasticity. Next, I consider a number of potential implications for research on parental effects and phenotypic matching, and conclude by discussing how plasticity may become a target of evolutionary conflict between parents and offspring. In total, I aim to show how the idea of plasticity as a developing trait offers a rich source of questions and insights that may inform future research in this area",,text,,,
phenotypic plasticity hypothesis,100628576,"BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC.",,H. Frederik Nijhout,2014,"Phenotypic plasticity is the primitive character state for most if not all traits. Insofar as developmental and physiological processes obey the laws of chemistry and physics, they will be sensitive to such environmental vari-ables as temperature, nutrient supply, ionic environment, and the availability of various macro- and micronutrients. De-pending on the effect this phenotypic plasticity has on fitness, evolution may proceed to select either for mechanisms that buffer or canalize the phenotype against relevant environ-mental variation or for a modified plastic response in which some ranges of the phenotypic variation are adaptive to partic-ular environments. Phenotypic plasticity can be continuous, in which case it is called a reaction norm, or discontinuous, in which case it is called a polyphenism. Although the mor-phological discontinuity of some polyphenisms is produced by discrete developmental switches, most polyphenisms are due to discontinuities in the environment that induce only por-tions of what is in reality a continuous reaction norm. In insect polyphenisms, the environmental variable that induces the al-ternative phenotype is a token stimulus that serves as a pre-dictor of, but is not itself, the environment to which the polyphenism is an adaptation. In all cases studied so far, the environmental stimulus alters the endocrine mechanism of metamorphosis by altering either the pattern of hormone secretion or the pattern of hormone sensitivity in different tis-sues. Such changes in the patterns of endocrine interactions result in the execution of alternative developmental path-ways. The spatial and temporal compartmentalization of endocrine interactions has produced a developmental mech-anism that enables substantial localized changes in morphol-ogy that remain well integrated into the structure and function of the organism",,text,,,

Rela-tive fitness is calculated depending on the difference between inducing and non-induc-ing states of the environment and its coefficient of variation, on the time pattern and on the relative length of the inducing environment. In addition, fitness of reversible plas-ticity depends on the time delays for changing the phenotype from non-induced to induced and back.

It has been suggested that phenotypic integration, the structure of trait covariation, could limit trait plasticity. However, the relationship between plasticity and integration is far from resolved. Using a database of functional plasticity to drought of a Mediterranean shrub that included 20 ecophysiological traits, we assessed environmentally-induced changes in phenotypic integration and whether integration constrained the expression of plasticity, accounting for thewithin-environment phenotypic variation of traits. Furthermore, we provide the first test of the association between differential trait plasticity and trait integration across an optimumand a stressful environment. Phenotypic plasticity was positively associated with phenotypic integration in both environments, but this relationship was lost when phenotypic variation was considered. The similarityin the plastic response of two traits predicted their integration across environments, with integrated traits having more similar plasticity. Such variation in the plasticity of traits partly explained the lower phenotypic integration found in the stressful environment. We found no evidence that integration may constitute an internal constraint to plasticity. Rather, we present the first empirical demonstration that differences in plastic responses mayinvolve a major reorganization of the relationships among traits, and challenge the notion thatstress generally induces a tighter phenotype.This work was funded by grants GYPSEVOL (CGL2016-75566-P), Remedinal (TE-CM: S2018/EMT-4338), Phenotypes (PGC2018-099115-B-I00) and the Ramon y Cajal Programme of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness.Peer reviewe",,"artículo, http://purl.org/coar/resource_type/c_6501","Norm of reaction, Phenotypic integration, Phenotypic plasticity, Plasticityintegration, Plasticity of phenotypic integration, Within environment phenotypic variationn",New Phytologist,'Wiley'

In 1965, British biologist A. D. Bradshaw proposed a widely cited model intended to explain the evolution of norms of reaction, based on his studies of plant populations. Bradshaw’s model went beyond the notion of the “adaptive norm of reaction” discussed before him by Dobzhansky and Schmalhausen by suggesting that “plasticity” – the ability of a phenotype to be modified by the environment – should be genetically determined. To prove Bradshaw’s hypothesis, it became necessary for some authors to identify the pressures exerted by natural selection on phenotypic plasticity in particular traits, and thus to model its evolution. In this paper, I contrast two different views, based on quantitative genetic models, proposed in the mid-1980s: Russell Lande and Sara Via’s conception of phenotypic plasticity, which assumes that the evolution of plasticity is linked to the evolution of the plastic trait itself, and Samuel Scheiner and Richard Lyman’s view, which assumes that the evolution of plasticity is independent from the evolution of the trait.

phenotypic plasticity hypothesis,106170064,SYMPOSIUM Assessing the Impacts of Phenotypic Plasticity on Evolution,,Matthew A. Wund,2016,"Synopsis In the past decade, there has been a resurgent interest in whether and how phenotypic plasticity might impact evolutionary processes. Of fundamental importance is how the environment influences individual phenotypic develop-ment while simultaneously selecting among phenotypic variants in a population. Conceptual and theoretical treatments of the evolutionary implications of plasticity are numerous, as are criticisms of the conclusions. As such, the time is ripe for empirical evidence to catch up with theoretical predictions. To this end, I provide a summary of eight hypotheses at the core of this issue, highlighting various approaches by which they can be tested. My goal is to provide practical guidance to those seeking to understand the complex ways by which phenotypic plasticity can influence evolutionary innovation and diversification.

This was brought out in a quantitative model by Hinton &amp; Nowlan (1987,Complex Systems1,497-502). The present work confirms and extends their results. We consider a population of genetically haploid individuals of fixed size. Genotypes are represented by one-dimensional arrays (strings) of genes. Each gene can be in one of three allelic states, designated 1, 0 andX.1 and 0 stand forfixedstates, that is for states with predetermined effects on the phenotype.Xstands for aplasticstate: the phenotypic effect of anXcan be equivalent to that of a 1 or a 0, the actual choice being realized by a process of random coin-tossing. Our model, in contrast to that of Hinton and Nowlan, assumes a relatively smooth dependence of fitness on distance from a pre-assigned target genotype. From the fitness values, the number of individuals reaching reproductive maturity is determined. Reproduction involves random mating and a single recombinational event, with one of the two progeny genotypes becoming, in turn, a possible parental genotype for the next generation. We find that it is because of the special assumptions in the Hinton and Nowlan model that phenotypic plasticity invariably accelerates evolution. The relationship is not as straightforward with realistic fitness schemes. Instead, the general result is that plasticity, up to a certain optimal level, slows down the rate of evolutionary change but improves the level of adaptation finally reached",,"Article, PeerReviewed",QH301 Biology,,'Elsevier BV'

Phenotypic plasticity occurs in many forms and at many biological scales, and its adaptive value depends on the specific environment and interactions with other plant traits and organisms. Even though plasticity is the norm rather than the exception, its complex nature has been a challenge in characterizing the expression of plasticity, its adaptive value for fitness and the environmental cues that regulate its expression.ScopeThis review discusses the characterization and costs of plasticity and approaches, considerations, and promising research directions in studying plasticity. Phenotypic plasticity is genetically controlled and heritable; however, little is known about how organisms perceive, interpret and respond to environmental cues, and the genes and pathways associated with plasticity. Not every genotype is plastic for every trait, and plasticity is not infinite, suggesting trade-offs, costs and limits to expression of plasticity. The timing, specificity and duration of plasticity are critical to their adaptive value for plant fitness.ConclusionsThere are many research opportunities to advance our understanding of plant phenotypic plasticity. New methodology and technological breakthroughs enable the study of phenotypic responses across biological scales and in multiple environments.

Different components of phenotypic variation can be distinguished that correspond to those inputs, but the response of the system to each input factor can be modulated by other factors, so that there are interactions among the factors. This paper uses the concept of the target phenotype, introduced by Nijhout and Davidowitz to designate the expected phenotype for a given genotype and environment, to provide definitions and explanations of key concepts. This logic is put to use to explore the factors contributing to fluctuating asymmetry. To illustrate how genetic variation, phenotypic plasticity in response to temperature variation, and random developmental noise interact, this study uses computer simulations based on a simplified developmental model of a trait. The simulations show extensive interactions among the input factors, which can be explained by the non-linear nature of the developmental model. As a result, all the loci that control the developmental parameters end up affecting the resulting phenotypic trait, its reaction norm in response to temperature changes, and also its fluctuating asymmetry. Further, temperature (or possibly other environmental factors) can affect both trait values and the amount of fluctuating asymmetry without any involvement of stress. The model is broadly consistent with what is known from actual biological systems, and the results obtained from it have far-reaching implications for interpreting observations of the different types of phenotypic variation.</p",,"Dataset, Dataset","Evolutionary Biology, Ecology, Invasive Species Ecology, Landscape Ecology, Conservation and Biodiversity, Behavioural Ecology, Community Ecology (excl.

The Predictive Adaptive Response (PAR) hypothesis refers to a form of developmental plasticity in which cues received in early life influence the development of a phenotype that is normally adapted to the environmental conditions of later life. When the predicted and actual environments differ, the mismatch between the individual's phenotype and the conditions in which it finds itself can have adverse consequences for Darwinian fitness and, later, for health. Numerous examples exist of the long-term effects of cues indicating a threatening environment affecting the subsequent phenotype of the individual organism. Other examples consist of the long-term effects of variations in environment within a normal range, particularly in the individual's nutritional environment. In mammals the cues to developing offspring are often provided by the mother's plane of nutrition, her body composition or stress levels. This hypothetical effect in humans is thought to be important by some scientists and controversial by others. In resolving the conflict, distinctions should be drawn between PARs induced by normative variations in the developmental environment and the ill effects on development of extremes in environment such as a very poor or very rich nutritional environment. Tests to distinguish between different developmental processes impacting on adult characteristics are proposed.

This series of essays addresses plasticity from the perspective of developmental mor-phology. The first essay deals with the problem of distinguishing between plasticity and other types of ontogenetic variation. In a temporally varying environment, morphological plasticity may be expressed as the production of a succession of different metamers. However, even in a constant environment, plant metamers can vary dramatically, a phenomenon known as heteroblasty. Be-cause heteroblasty and plasticity can yield similar patterns of ontogenetic variation, the two are often confounded in analyses of developmental plasticity. The second essay discusses the integra-tion of plant phenotypic responses and finds that the evidence for integration is equivocal. The third section shows that developmental properties can constrain the expression of morphological plasticity. Developmental lags and the ‘epiphenotype problem ’ are particularly important features for analyses of the evolution and expression of plasticity. Finally, in answer to the question of strategies for studying plasticity, I emphasize the need for research at multiple levels and for the inclusion of a historical or phylogenetic perspective.

Specifically, plasticity directly allows short-termphenotypic responses within and/or across generations, whichcould currently be adaptive, nonadaptive, or maladaptive (e.g.,Agrawal et al. 1999; Ghalambor et al. 2007; Beaman et al. 2016;Donelson et al. 2018; Arnold et al. 2019a). Theory also showshow plasticity could affect persistence of populations experienc-ing directional environmental change (Chevin et al. 2010), andfacilitate longer term evolutionary adaptation to novel environ-ments through rapid expression and evolution of plastic responsesfollowed by genetic assimilation (Lande 2009, 2015). Rational-izing current forms of plasticity, and quantifying drivers of andconstraints on future evolutionary changes, will consequently becentral to understanding and predicting phenotypic, populationdynamic, and evolutionary outcomes across multiple spatial andtemporal scales (Gavrilets and Scheiner 1993a; Scheiner 1993;Chevin et al. 2010; Lande 2014; Murren et al. 2014; Ehrenreichand Pfennig 2016; Chevin and Hoffmann 2017; Kelly 2019).In general, such outcomes depend on numerous propertiesof focal systems, including (i) forms and magnitudes of plastic-ity in ecologically relevant traits that affect fitness; (ii) resultingselection acting on such traits and on trait plasticity; and (iii)components of additive genetic (co)variation involving plastic-ity, and resulting patterns of inheritance and potential for plastic-ity evolution and genetic assimilation.

Directly evident when individualsfrom the same lineage are exposed to different initial environmental conditions, resulting inpermanent among-individual variation.Labile plasticity Plasticity in traits that are repeatedly and hence potentially reversibly re-expressed multipletimes through an individual’s life. Directly evident when individuals experience changingenvironmental conditions, resulting in longitudinal within-individual variation.Threshold trait A trait that shows two (or more) discrete phenotypic states, where phenotypic expressiondirectly depends on the value of an underlying “liability” relative to a threshold.Liability A latent quantitative genetic trait that can comprise genetic and environmental components,and that translates deterministically into expression of alternative discrete phenotypes whenabove versus below a threshold.Latent plasticity Environmentally induced variation in liability. Such latent plasticity is not necessarilymanifested as observable phenotypic plasticity, depending on whether it causes the liabilityto cross the threshold. Latent plasticity can be developmental and/or labile.exert their effects in the contexts of environmental variability andpredictability across episodes of trait development and expres-sion versus selection (Scheiner 1993; DeWitt et al. 1998; de Jong2005; Lande 2009, 2014, 2015; Chevin et al. 2010; Ashanderet al. 2016; Chevin and Hoffmann 2017; Donelson et al. 2018).Accordingly, numerous empirical studies aim to quantify formsof plasticity in focal traits in experimental or wild populations,and to estimate components of selection and underlying addi-tive genetic (co)variances (Scheiner 1993; Pigliucci 2005; Char-mantier and Gienapp 2014; Murren et al. 2014; Hendry 2016;Chevin and Hoffmann 2017; Arnold et al. 2019a; Kelly 2019).However, many recent theoretical and empirical studies, andconceptual reviews, invoke a key assumption that relationshipsbetween expressed phenotypes and underlying environmentalvariables are linear on observed phenotypic scales (i.e., linearphenotypic reaction norms, e.g., Nussey et al. 2007; Lande 2009,2014, 2015; Chevin et al. 2010; Dingemanse et al. 2010; Chevinand Hoffmann 2017; Arnold et al. 2019a), with extensions toconsider polynomial functions (Gavrilets and Scheiner 1993a,b;Scheiner 1993; de Jong 2005; Morrissey and Leifting 2016). Suchlinearities are commonly invoked to facilitate mathematical, sta-tistical, and/or verbal tractability, not necessarily because thereis strong evidence or belief that phenotype-environment relation-ships will typically be straightforwardly linear in nature (notedby Gavrilets and Scheiner 1993b; Nussey et al. 2007; Lande2009, 2014; Chevin et al. 2010; Dingemanse et al. 2010; Chevinand Hoffmann 2017). Indeed, many ecologically important traitsthat could substantially affect population responses to varyingand changing environments show markedly nonlinear phenotypicchanges, which also do not directly conform to simple polyno-mial functions (Valladares et al. 2006; Chevin et al. 2010; Murrenet al. 2014; Beaman et al. 2016; Arnold et al. 2019b).Not least, many important morphological, behavioral, andlife-history traits expressed across the natural world show two(or more) approximately discrete phenotypic states, whose ex-pression partly depends on current and/or previous environ-ments (West-Eberhard 1989; Scheiner 1993; Roff 1996). Forexample, such traits encompass dichotomous movements, mat-ing behaviors, and reproductive parameters alongside alterna-tive morphological developments. Given some polygenic basis,such traits can be appropriately conceptualized as quantitativegenetic “threshold traits,” where an underlying “liability” trans-lates into expression of alternative discrete phenotypes whenabove versus below a threshold (Falconer and Mackay 1996; Roff1996). Such threshold traits are well known to have distinctiveintrinsic genetic and microevolutionary properties compared tostandard quantitative traits that are continuously distributed onobserved phenotypic scales. For example, they can maintain sub-stantial “cryptic” genetic variation that is not typically pheno-typically expressed, and phenotypic heritability, selection inten-sity, and evolutionary responses all depend on phenotype fre-quencies (Gianola 1982; Roff 1994a, 1996, 1998a; Falconerand Mackay 1996, Ch. 18; Lynch and Walsh 1998, Ch. 25;Moorad and Linksvayer 2008). However, the ways in whichthreshold traits could also show distinctive intrinsic forms andproperties of phenotypic plasticity, and hence foster distinc-tive patterns of short-term phenotypic variation and longer termmicroevolutionary outcomes in varying and changing environ-ments, have received surprisingly little explicit attention. Becauserapid plastic expression of alternative discrete phenotypes couldEVOLUTION FEBRUARY 2022 191PERSPECTIVEdramatically affect population outcomes, and even flip popula-tions between alternative ecological states, such properties andtheir consequences should be fully incorporated into moderntreatments of plasticity and its implications.Accordingly, we highlight multiple intrinsic properties ofthreshold traits that could cause distinctive patterns of phe-notypic plasticity, and drive distinctive phenotypic and mi-croevolutionary outcomes, that differ substantially from thoseinvolving traits that are continuously distributed on observed phe-notypic scales. We thereby outline key attributes that should beincorporated into (eco)evolutionary theory for dichotomous traitsand quantified empirically, and summarize how such advancescould be achieved. To provide necessary context for our focuson threshold traits and facilitate comparisons, we first synthesizecore principles of plasticity in continuously distributed traits, asare currently widely envisaged. Key terminologies are summa-rized in Table 1.Concepts of Plasticity in ContinuousTraitsPlasticity in continuously distributed quantitative traits is com-monly conceptualized and quantified in two different ways bydiffering groups of researchers. First, experimental evolutionarybiologists commonly measure plasticity by splitting families orclones across different (known) environments and measuring re-sulting mean phenotypes in each environment (Fig. 1A). Plas-ticity is therefore typically viewed as among-individual pheno-typic variation within families or genotypes and hence withinlineages, often focusing on traits that are effectively expressedonce as the culmination of initial development (here termed de-velopmental plasticity [Table 1; Fig. 1A], elsewhere termed fixed,irreversible, or “one-shot” plasticity [Scheiner 1993, 2002; vanBuskirk and Steiner 2009; Auld et al. 2010; Lande 2015; Hendry2016]). Such developmental plasticity is also the primary fo-cus of most theory on plasticity evolution and its implications,which typically considers relationships between environments oftrait development versus selection and assumes nonzero additivegenetic variation in developmental reaction norm slopes (e.g.,Gavrilets and Scheiner 1993a; Lande 2009, 2015; Ashander et al.2016). Such genetic variation, and potential covariation with de-velopmental reaction norm intercepts, can be evaluated empiri-cally through quantitative genetic experiments that split sufficientfamilies across environments (Fig. 1A; Scheiner 1993; Pigliucci2005; Arnold et al. 2019b), and/or through experimental evolu-tion (Scheiner 2002).Second, in wild animal evolutionary ecology and behav-ioral ecology, where families or clones often cannot be so readilycreated or manipulated, plasticity is typically measured as chang-ing phenotypes of single individuals when exposed to differ-ent environments (Fig. 1B). It is consequently viewed as lon-gitudinal within-individual phenotypic variation, evidenced byindividual-level reaction norm slopes that differ from zero. Ittherefore necessarily concerns flexible traits that individuals ex-press multiple times (termed labile plasticity, Table 1; Fig. 1B;Nussey et al. 2007; Dingemanse et al. 2010; Dingemanse andWolf 2013; Charmantier and Gienapp 2014; Lande 2014, 2015;Hendry 2016).Since developmental plasticity and labile plasticity can in-duce differing short-term phenotypic dynamics and longer termevolutionary dynamics (e.g., Lande 2009, 2014, 2015, 2019), yetcould co-occur and interact, both ideally need to be combinedinto a single holistic conceptual framework that encompassesoverall phenotypic variation resulting from initial developmentand subsequent environmental impacts (Beaman et al. 2016).This can in principle be achieved through quantitative geneticapproaches that fully consider interacting environmental and ge-netic effects on overall individual reaction norms, encompass-ing intercepts (i.e., elevations), slopes, and intercept-slope andslope-slope covariances across developmental and labile plastic-ity (Fig. 1C; Supporting Information S1).Here, individual reaction norm intercepts can reflect the out-come of developmental plasticity, resulting in lasting effects onan individual’s mean phenotype as shaped by its developmen-tal reaction norm and early-life environmental experience (red,Fig. 1C). The developmental reaction norm intercept and slopecould in turn show additive genetic (co)variation, as commonlyconsidered in theoretical and empirical studies focusing solelyon developmental plasticity (Fig. 1A). Meanwhile, variation inindividual reaction norm slopes (blue, Fig. 1C) could reflect di-rect additive genetic effects, representing genetic variation in la-bile plasticity, and/or permanent environmental effects includingfurther legacies of developmental plasticity. For example, an indi-vidual’s mean phenotype, as shaped by developmental plasticity,could affect its ability to subsequently express labile plasticity.Complex genetic and/or environmental intercept-slope covari-ances for overall reaction norms could then arise, for example, ifindividuals with low phenotypic intercepts typically haveshallower (or steeper) phenotypic reaction norm slopes thanindividuals with higher intercepts (Fig. 1C; Supporting Informa-tion S1; Nussey et al. 2007; Dingemanse and Wolf 2013).In simple cases with linear reaction norms for both devel-opmental and labile plasticity (e.g., Fig. 1A, B), the full quanti-tative genetic architecture of the overall individual reaction norm(e.g., Fig. 1C) can then be conceptualized as a three-parameter G-matrix (i.e., additive genetic variance-covariance matrix). Here,the three elementary parameters comprise the intercept and slopeof the reaction norm for developmental plasticity (which togethershape the intercept of the overall individual reaction norm), andthe slope of the reaction norm for labile plasticity (Supporting192 EVOLUTION FEBRUARY 2022PERSPECTIVEFigure 1.

(D) Scenario of directional selection on reaction norm slope, where lineages or individuals with steeppositive slopes have higher (or lower) fitness than those with shallow slopes, with relative fitness denoted by differing shades of gray.Lower fitness lineages would gradually be selected out, reducing G×E.

These three parameters could be positively ornegatively genetically correlated (or uncorrelated), potentiallyimplying composite constraints on the form of additive geneticvariation available to allow evolutionary responses to selectionon any characteristic of the overall individual reaction norm (e.g.,Gomulkiewicz and Kirkpatrick 1992; Nussey et al. 2007; Walshand Blows 2009). For example, if reaction norm slopes for de-velopmental and labile plasticity are strongly positively or nega-tively correlated, then evolution of both could be exacerbated orinhibited given particular regimes of selection.This three-trait conceptualization of overall plasticity com-bines and advances current standard conceptualizations of lin-ear reaction norms, which typically focus on either developmen-tal plasticity or labile plasticity but not both. Such conceptual-izations effectively generate two-parameter models that considersingle intercepts and slopes (Supporting Information S1). Yet, thebasic premise that environmentally induced phenotypic variationin continuously distributed quantitative traits is adequately de-scribed through linear (or polynomial) reaction norms for devel-opmental and/or labile plasticity expressed on observed pheno-typic scales implies multiple intrinsic properties of genetic varia-tion in, selection on, and inheritance of plasticity (Table 2). Theseproperties are fundamental to mathematical and verbal theory re-garding the implications of plasticity for population dynamic andevolutionary outcomes, and have motivated and underpinned nu-merous empirical examinations.Key Properties of Plasticity inContinuous TraitsFirst, ongoing evolution of the degree of phenotypic plasticity(whether developmental and/or labile) in continuously distributedtraits is envisaged to involve evolution of reaction norm slopes.Such evolution in turn requires nonzero additive genetic varia-tion in slope (and/or in other parameters describing polynomialreaction norm shapes; Gavrilets and Scheiner 1993a,b; Scheiner1993, 2002; de Jong and Gavrilets 2000; Nussey et al. 2007;Lande 2009, 2014; Ashander et al. 2016; Arnold et al. 2019b).This implies existence of gene-by-environment interactions onthe observed phenotypic scale (i.e., nonzero G×E shaping devel-opmental and/or labile plasticity), meaning that genetic effects onphenotypes vary among environments (Fig. 1C; Table 2). Givenlinear reaction norms, nonzero G×E can readily cause substan-tially greater additive genetic variation in phenotypes in more ex-treme (i.e., unusual) environments. This is especially likely givensome canalization of mean phenotype (and hence little additivegenetic variation) in typical environments that a population haspreviously frequently experienced, due to long-term stabilizingselection (e.g., Nussey et al. 2007; Lande 2015). Such effectsgenerate potential for rapid evolutionary responses to selectionfollowing environmental change (Lande 2009; Ashander et al.2016). However, there will not necessarily be nonzero G×E inany particular system, and quantifying the form and magnitudeof G×E has been a major empirical endeavor in experimentalsystems (Scheiner 1993, 2002; Pigliucci 2005) and, increasingly,in free-living wild populations (Nussey et al. 2007; Charmantierand Gienapp 2014; Ramakers et al. 2018; Kelly 2019; SupportingInformation S2).Second, directional selection for or against phenotypic plas-ticity is envisaged to effectively exert directional selection on themagnitude of the reaction norm slope (either directly or indi-rectly through covariance with intercepts and hence trait means;Fig. 1D; Table 2; Scheiner 1993, 2002). Selection for increasedplasticity (i.e., favoring steeper slopes) can in principle arise ifincreased phenotypic sensitivity to environmental conditions in-creases fitness, irrespective of whether the sign of the optimalreaction norm slope is positive or negative (Arnold et al. 2019a).Meanwhile, selection against plasticity (i.e., favoring shallowerslopes) can arise if there are fitness costs of expressing differentor changing phenotypes or simply of maintaining physiologicalcapacities to do so (often termed induced vs. constitutive costs;DeWitt et al. 1998; van Buskirk and Steiner 2009; Auld et al.2010; Chevin et al. 2010; Arnold et al. 2019a). Overall stabiliz-ing selection around an optimal degree of plasticity, and hencearound an optimal reaction norm slope, could potentially result.If there is initially nonzero G×E (and hence additive ge-netic variation in reaction norm slopes), then directional selectioncould cause evolutionary changes in slope and hence in the de-gree of phenotypic plasticity. Yet, directional or stabilizing selec-tion could gradually erode additive genetic variation and dimin-ish G×E, reducing subsequent evolutionary responses (Fig. 1D;van Buskirk and Steiner 2009; Ehrenreich and Pfennig 2016;Saltz et al. 2018; but see Lande 2009). Further studies have con-sequently postulated mechanisms by which genetic variation inplasticity and associated evolutionary potential, and polymor-phisms comprising plastic and canalized (i.e., nonenvironmen-tally responsive) individuals, can be maintained (Wolf and Weiss-ing 2010; Dingemanse and Wolf 2013; Saltz et al. 2018). Forexample, combinations of negative frequency-dependent se-lection on plastic versus canalized phenotypes, and positivefeedbacks that reduce costs of repeated trait expression, havebeen invoked to explain ongoing coexistence of responsiveand unresponsive lineages (i.e., polymorphism in labile plas-ticity; Wolf et al. 2008; Wolf and Weissing 2010). In princi-ple, additive genetic variation in reaction norm slopes couldbe maintained through disruptive selection, where individualswith slopes of either extreme have consistently higher fitnessthan individuals with intermediate slopes, but such selectionseems unlikely to be commonplace (Saltz et al. 2018; SupportingInformation S2).194 EVOLUTION FEBRUARY 2022PERSPECTIVETable 2. Summary of key differences between typically assumed properties of traits that are continuously distributed on observedphenotypic scales (left column) versus properties of discrete threshold traits (right column), regarding (A) genetic variation in pheno-typic plasticity, (B) phenotypic variation in phenotypic plasticity, (C) selection on phenotypic plasticity, and (D) apparent inheritance ofphenotypic plasticity.Continuously distributed traits Threshold traits(A) • Genetic variation in phenotypic plasticity requiresgenetic variation in reaction norm slopes, and hencerequires gene-by-environment interactions (G×E) onthe observed phenotypic scale.• Such G×E, and hence genetic variation in phenotypicplasticity, will not necessarily be present.• G×E could be eroded by directional or stabilizingselection on phenotypic plasticity, and hence onreaction norm slope. Long-term maintenance ofadditive genetic variation (and hence phenotypicvariation) in phenotypic plasticity may thereforerequire further explanations.• With nonzero G×E and linear reaction norms andstabilizing selection on phenotypes in typicalenvironments, additive genetic variation in phenotypecan readily be greater in extreme environments,facilitating rapid evolutionary responses to selection.• Genetic variation in phenotypic plasticity could resultfrom genetic variation in liability-scale reaction normintercepts.

Genetic variation in phenotypicplasticity may therefore be revealed givenenvironmental variation or change, and require littlefurther explanation.• Genetic variation in phenotype will not necessarilyincrease, and could easily decrease toward zero, inextreme environments.(B) • A persistent mixture of highly phenotypically plasticand strongly environmentally canalized genotypes orindividuals requires some further explanation (e.g.,disruptive or negative frequency-dependent selectionon reaction norm slope).• The degree of phenotypic plasticity or canalizationdefined by the reaction norm slope can, in principle,be independent of the reaction norm intercept, andhence of population mean phenotype.• A persistent mixture of highly phenotypically plasticand strongly environmentally canalized genotypes orindividuals is likely. It requires little furtherexplanation beyond some mechanism maintainingvariation in liability that spans the threshold, andresulting expression of each alternative phenotype.• The mean degree of canalization (and hencerepeatability) of a particular discrete phenotype islinked to the mean liability-scale reaction normintercept, and is expected to increase with phenotypefrequency.(C) • Consistent directional selection for or againstphenotypic plasticity will cause consistent directionalselection on reaction norm slope.• Such selection could gradually erode G×E.• Consistent directional selection for or againstphenotypic plasticity could potentially causestabilizing or disruptive selection on liability intercept.The form of selection on liability could change asevolution progresses.• Such selection could potentially drive evolution ofcomplex forms of liability-scale G×E andintercept-slope covariances.(D) • Reproduction between highly canalized parents, orparents with opposite reaction norm slopes, willtypically result in highly phenotypically canalizedoffspring. Highly canalized parents cannot readilyproduce highly phenotypically plastic offspring.• Mutation or gene flow would be required to regenerateplasticity in canalized populations.• Reproduction between highly phenotypicallycanalized parents with different fixed phenotypes canreadily result in highly phenotypically plasticoffspring. Selection for or against plasticity mayconsequently impose indirect selection on matechoice.• Phenotypic plasticity (or canalization) could be hardto eradicate even given strong selection against it.EVOLUTION FEBRUARY 2022 195PERSPECTIVEThird, reaction norm parameters, and resulting forms of phe-notypic plasticity, are expected to adhere to basic principles ofadditive genetic inheritance given sexual reproduction. Conse-quently, matings between environmentally canalized parents (i.e.,with reaction norm slopes for developmental and/or labile plas-ticity that are close to zero) will typically produce canalizedoffspring (i.e., also with expected reaction norm slopes closeto zero), as could matings between parents with slopes of sim-ilar magnitudes but opposite signs (Fig. 1E; Table 2). How-ever, highly phenotypically canalized parents are unlikely to pro-duce highly plastic offspring (i.e., with very steep reaction normslopes), although such offspring could occasionally arise throughsampling variance around the expectation. Indeed, population-wide canalization across environments can be viewed as fixationof genetic variants that increase robustness to environmental vari-ation (Ehrenreich and Pfennig 2016). Additional sources of newgenetic variation in reaction norm slopes, whether from mutationor gene flow stemming from immigration given local adaptation,are then required to generate new developmental and/or labilephenotypic plasticity in currently phenotypically canalized pop-ulations (e.g., Saltz et al. 2018).The above properties and principles of genetic variation in,selection on, and inheritance of phenotypic plasticity in continu-ously distributed traits (Table 2) explicitly or implicitly underpinmuch theory regarding the expression, evolutionary dynamics,and consequences of plasticity. But such properties could be qual-itatively different for threshold traits, implying that the dynamicsand consequences of plasticity might also differ substantially.Concepts of Plasticity in ThresholdTraitsThe concept of a threshold trait (or “threshold character”) islong established in quantitative genetics, spanning animal breed-ing, medicine, and diverse areas of evolutionary biology (Wright1934; Gianola 1982; Falconer and Mackay 1996, Ch. 18; Roff1996, 1998a; Lynch and Walsh 1998, Ch. 25; Tomkins and Hazel2007; Moorad and Linksvayer 2008; Grossen et al. 2010; Pulido2011; Dodson et al. 2013; Hadfield 2015). In brief, each individ-ual is envisaged to have an underlying “liability,” defined as a la-tent (i.e., unobserved) continuously distributed quantitative traitthat can have multiple genetic and environmental components,and which causes expression of alternative discrete phenotypeswhen above versus below a threshold value (Table 1; Fig. 2A).Expression of the alternative phenotypes is envisaged to bedeterministic conditional on the liability (i.e., outcomes are notnecessarily directly probabilistic; Supporting Information S1).Substantial genetic and/or environmental variation in liability (oneither side of the threshold) can consequently exist without caus-ing any phenotypic variation.To date, properties of threshold traits have commonly beenconsidered for dichotomous traits that are effectively expressedonce through differential development, resulting in permanentlydifferent discrete phenotypes (e.g., skeletal structures; morpho-logical defenses against predation; winged [i.e., dispersive] vs.wingless forms; facultative diapause; sex; and fixed dichoto-mous reproductive and/or life-history strategies, among others,e.g., Roff 1994a, 1996; Falconer and Mackay 1996; Agrawalet al. 1999; Ostrowski et al. 2000; Bégin and Roff 2002; Hazelet al. 2004; Tomkins and Hazel 2007; Grossen et al. 2010; Dod-son et al. 2013; Snell-Rood et al. 2018; Debes et al. 2020).Here, phenotypic outcomes commonly depend partly on initialenvironmental conditions, representing developmental plasticity(Scheiner 1993; Roff 1996; Bégin and Roff 2002; Snell-Roodet al. 2018).However, as with many continuously distributed traits, manythreshold traits are re-expressed on time frames of hours, days,seasons, or years, potentially allowing labile plasticity manifestedas reversible individual expression of alternative phenotypeswhen exposed to different environments (i.e., within-individualphenotypic variation; Table 1). Obvious examples include di-chotomous behaviors, including diel movements and dominantversus subordinate mating tactics (e.g., Harrison et al. 2017;Crocker-Buta and Leary 2018); seasonal migration versus year-round residence (Brodersen et al. 2014; Reid et al. 2018, Reidet al. 2020); and diverse aspects of reproduction including breed-ing versus skipping, production of twins versus one offspring, ordivorce or extra-pair mating versus mate fidelity in iteroparousspecies (Falconer and Mackay 1996; Duthie et al. 2016; Ger-main et al. 2018). Key properties of plasticity in such thresh-old traits could differ quite fundamentally from those for con-tinuously distributed traits where linear (or polynomial) reactionnorms are manifested on observed phenotypic scales (Table 2).These properties and differences result from forms of genetic andenvironmental variation in underlying liability, and their nonlin-ear translation into discrete observed phenotypes (Fig. 2A).Viewed most simply, each individual has an inherited addi-tive genetic value for liability, plus some set of environmentaleffects on liability that could reflect current and/or previous en-vironmental conditions (Roff 1996). These environmental effectscan be envisaged to result from liability-scale reaction norms thatshape responses to environmental variation, where reaction normslopes could show additive genetic variation (i.e., generatingG×E in liability). Indeed, the whole structure of reaction normintercepts, slopes, and covariances that acts on the observed phe-notypic scale for continuously distributed traits (Fig. 1C) can beenvisaged to similarly act on the latent liability scale for thresh-old traits (Fig. 2C). The threshold itself can then be viewed as ahigher level reaction norm (or “developmental map”) that deter-ministically translates the combined genetic and environmental196 EVOLUTION FEBRUARY 2022PERSPECTIVEFigure 2. (A) Basic concept of a threshold trait, where liability values below and above a threshold (dashed line) translate determinis-tically into discrete phenotypes ❶ and ❷ (zones of lighter and darker gray shading), respectively. This concept can be extended to traitswith multiple discrete phenotypes, given further thresholds. (B) Individuals with initial liabilities near the threshold (dark gray shading)are likely to be phenotypically plastic, whereas individuals with initial liabilities far from the threshold (light gray shading) are likely to bephenotypically canalized. Given an approximately Gaussian distribution of liabilities centered away from the threshold (white curve), themore frequently expressed phenotype will include more individuals with liabilities further from the threshold, which are therefore morelikely to be phenotypically canalized (i.e., repeatable). (C and D) Individual liabilities in relation to environmental variation (i.e., liability-scale reaction norms), comprising intercepts (red points, which can reflect outcomes of developmental plasticity in liability) and slopes(blue lines, representing labile plasticity in liability). These attributes are analogous to those for continuous phenotypic traits (Fig. 1C).Black dashed lines demarcate thresholds distinguishing expression of discrete phenotypes ❶ and ❷. Individuals with reaction normsthat cross the threshold within the observed range of environmental variation show phenotypic plasticity (solid blue lines), whereasindividuals with reaction norms that do not cross the threshold are phenotypically canalized (dotted blue lines). There might or mightnot be among-individual variation in reaction norm slopes for labile plasticity in liability, representing liability-scale G×E (C vs. D). (E)Illustration of high repeatability of both alternative phenotypes and of phenotypic plasticity. Dark, mid, and light blue points representliability values, and resulting observed phenotypes (❶ and ❷), across a timeseries (sequence of occasions) for three different individualswith different liability intercepts. All three individuals experience similar regimes of environmental variation across occasions and henceshow similar variation in liability, representing responses through similar liability-scale reaction norm slopes. Nevertheless, the light anddark blue individuals are repeatable (i.e., canalized) for phenotypes ❶ and ❷, respectively, whereas the mid blue individual is repeatablyphenotypically plastic (i.e., regularly switches between alternative phenotypes between consecutive occasions).EVOLUTION FEBRUARY 2022 197PERSPECTIVEeffects on the continuously distributed latent liability into dis-crete observed phenotypic outcomes (Fig. 2A, C; Supporting In-formation S1; Roff 1996; Lynch and Walsh 1998, Ch. 11). Thisconceptual model distinguishes plasticity occurring on the la-tent liability scale (i.e., latent plasticity) from plasticity occur-ring on the observed phenotypic scale (i.e., phenotypic plasticity;Table 1). It has multiple interesting implications for the expres-sion, form, and maintenance of phenotypic plasticity in relationto underlying genetic variation; for the consequences of selectionfor or against phenotypic plasticity; and for patterns of pheno-typic inheritance (Table 2).Key Properties of Plasticity inThreshold TraitsEXPRESSION OF PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY ANDUNDERLYING GENETIC VARIATIONIndividuals and lineages with initial liabilities (i.e., liabilityintercepts) near the threshold are more likely to be pheno-typically plastic (i.e., express different discrete phenotypes atdifferent times; Fig. 2B). This is because any subsequent smallenvironmental deviation in liability, whether due to predictableenvironmental responses shaped by liability-scale reaction normsand/or random microenvironmental deviations, is relatively likelyto push individuals across the threshold (in either direction) andhence induce expression of the alternative phenotype (Fig. 2B,C, E). In contrast, individuals and lineages with initial liabilitiesfar from the threshold (in either direction) are likely to be phe-notypically canalized, because even sizeable subsequent environ-mental deviations in liability are unlikely to induce phenotypicshifts (Fig. 2B, C, E). Substantial latent plasticity could then ex-ist in the form of liability-scale reaction norm slopes, but havezero phenotypic effect and hence be decoupled from expressionof phenotypic plasticity.Individuals’ expressions of either alternative phenotype, andof labile phenotypic plasticity (i.e., switching between discretephenotypes), can consequently be intrinsically positively corre-lated within and across time periods on different scales (e.g.,days, seasons, years). This is because individuals with liability in-tercepts far from or near to a fixed threshold on one occasion willalso have such intercepts subsequently. Sequences of small envi-ronmental deviations, or of predictable environmental changes,will consequently have phenotypic effects (or lack of effects)that are consistent across occasions within individuals. High in-dividual repeatability of expression of each discrete phenotype,alongside high individual repeatability of phenotypic plasticity,can therefore readily emerge (Fig. 2E). Population-wide repeata-bility of expression of each discrete phenotype will also be pos-itively associated with phenotype frequency, such that the mostfrequently expressed phenotype is the most highly repeatable.This is because, given the standard quantitative genetic assump-tion that the population distribution of liabilities is Gaussian, themost frequent phenotype will encompass more individuals whoseliabilities are further from the threshold and hence less likely tobe phenotypically plastic (Fig. 2B).Consequently, if there is nonzero additive genetic variationin liability intercept with a distribution of values that spans orapproaches the threshold, the basic implication is that there willbe nonzero genetic variation in expression of phenotypic plas-ticity (Fig. 2C, D). Specifically, genotypes that place an indi-vidual’s liability intercept near to or far from the threshold arelikely to effectively cause plastic and canalized phenotypes, re-spectively, given some regime of environmental variation. Re-sulting genetic variation in phenotypic plasticity does not nec-essarily require genetic variation in any reaction norm slope, orhence require nonzero G×E on the liability scale (Fig. 2D andTable 2, although such G×E could also exist, Fig. 2C). Rather,genetic and environmental effects that are straightforwardly ad-ditive on the liability intercept can induce nonadditive variationin environmental responses in observed discrete phenotypes (e.g.,Gianola 1982). This is because any particular additive genetic orenvironmental increment on liability might or might not cause achange in phenotype, or hence cause expression of phenotypicplasticity, depending on the preexisting liability value. Further,even with G×E and substantial resulting variation in linear re-action norm slopes on the latent liability scale, extreme environ-ments will not necessarily cause increased genetic variation inphenotype, and might even decrease such variation if all indi-viduals are pushed to the same side of the threshold (SupportingInformation S3).Effective genetic variation in phenotypic plasticity mightconsequently be commonplace, or even ubiquitous, in poly-morphic labile threshold traits. This is because such traits areexpected to maintain substantial additive genetic variation inliability. This in turn is because selection on genetic variantsthat do not immediately cause overall liability values to crossthe threshold (or hence cause any change in phenotype) is ex-pected to be weak, even given strong directional selection onphenotype, and especially if liability is highly polygenic (Roff1994a, 1996, 1998a,b). Intrinsic negative frequency-dependentselection on underlying genetic variants can also arise, furthercontributing to a relatively high expected mutation-selection bal-ance, alongside effects of drift in small populations (Roff 1998a).Resulting maintenance of substantial additive genetic variationhas, implicitly, been shown for liability-scale reaction norm inter-cepts (Roff 1994a, 1998a), but similar processes might also affectliability-scale reaction norm slopes. This is because considerablegenetic variation in slope could exist yet have little or no phe-notypic effect, and hence be effectively shielded from selection(Fig. 2C; Supporting Information S3).198 EVOLUTION FEBRUARY 2022PERSPECTIVEFigure 3. Potential consequences of selection (A and C) for and (B and D) against expression of labile phenotypic plasticity in a thresholdtrait for evolution of liability-scale reaction norm (A and B) intercepts and (C and D) slopes. On A and B, dark and light gray shadings indi-cate zones where individuals are likely to be phenotypically plastic or canalized, respectively. White curves depict potential distributionsof liability-scale reaction norm intercepts following strong selection (A) for and (B) against phenotypic plasticity, resulting in stabilizingand disruptive selection on intercept, respectively. On C and D, phenotypic plasticity occurs when an individual’s liability-scale reactionnorm crosses the threshold (black dashed line), causing changed expression of phenotype ❶ versus ❷ (darker vs. lighter gray zones).Reaction norm intercepts and slopes (depicted by red points and blue lines) could become (C) negatively or (D) positively correlated dueto selection for or against phenotypic plasticity. Intercepts might in turn be shaped by the intercept and slope of the reaction norm fordevelopmental plasticity, and reaction norms for labile and/or developmental plasticity could also be nonlinear.Given some regime of stochastic and/or predictable environ-mental variation, populations could therefore readily comprisemixtures of highly phenotypically plastic and highly canalizedindividuals (Fig. 2C, D, E; Table 2). No further explanations,such as negative frequency-dependent selection on expression ofplasticity coupled with positive feedbacks that reduce expressioncosts (Wolf et al. 2008; Wolf and Weissing 2010), or complexmechanisms driving evolution of multiple distinct tactics (En-gqvist and Taborsky 2016), are necessarily required (Hazel et al.2004, although such effects could additionally apply). Hence,although cross-environment phenotypic canalization of contin-uously distributed traits effectively requires fixation of geneticvariants that reduce reaction norm slopes and make traits robustto environmental variation (Ehrenreich and Pfennig 2016), suchfixation is not required to generate a highly phenotypically canal-ized threshold trait. Co-existence of canalized and phenotypicplastic individuals, and transitions between apparent canalizationand plasticity given environmental changes, is consequently rela-tively straightforward to explain at both population and individuallevels, and could rapidly occur without need for complex mecha-nisms or substantial mutation or gene flow.SELECTIONThe occurrence of directional selection for or against expressionof labile phenotypic plasticity in a threshold trait (i.e., higher orlower fitness in individuals that sequentially express both alter-native phenotypes) could imply that individuals with liability in-tercepts close to the threshold have higher or lower fitness, re-spectively, than individuals with liability intercepts further away.Directional selection for or against phenotypic plasticity couldconsequently induce stabilizing or disruptive selection on liabil-ity intercept if the distribution of liabilities substantially spansthe threshold (Fig. 3A, B), or directional selection if the distribu-tion only marginally spans the threshold. The form of selectionon liability induced by selection on phenotypic plasticity couldtherefore depend on the liability distribution and hence changewith the progress of evolution, even if the form of selection onexpression of phenotypic plasticity does not change at all.EVOLUTION FEBRUARY 2022 199PERSPECTIVEEras of directional selection on phenotypic plasticity thatcause directional, stabilizing, or disruptive selection on the lia-bility intercept could then, respectively, reduce additive geneticvariation, or increase additive genetic variation and even generatebimodal distributions (Fig. 3A, B). Unlike with continuously dis-tributed traits, evolution of phenotypic plasticity (whether devel-opmental and/or labile) could then proceed solely through evo-lution of distributions of reaction norm intercepts, irrespective ofslopes (Table 2).But, complex forms of liability-scale G×E that facilitate orprevent expression of phenotypic plasticity could also conceiv-ably evolve. For example, individuals with liability interceptsclose to or far from the threshold could in principle have liabil-ities that are differentially sensitive to environmental variation,implying evolution of some form of intercept-slope covariancefor the liability-scale reaction norm (Fig. 3C, D). Directional se-lection for or against expression of phenotypic plasticity couldtherefore potentially generate nonzero liability-scale G×E ratherthan eradicate it, which is opposite to basic expectations for con-tinuously distributed traits (Fig. 1D; Table 2). The presence ofnonzero liability-scale G×E could then serve to prevent expres-sion of phenotypic plasticity rather than necessarily define varia-tion in its presence.Because the intercept of the overall individual liability-scale reaction norm could depend on the form of developmentalplasticity (Fig. 2C), such outcomes will depend on the full quanti-tative genetic architecture of the liability-scale G-matrix, includ-ing genetic covariances between reaction norm slopes for de-velopmental versus labile plasticity. Evolution of such complexliability-scale quantitative genetic architectures (Fig. 3) wouldlikely require consistently strong selection for or against phe-notypic plasticity. But such selection might be expected to bestronger for labile threshold traits than for continuously dis-tributed traits, because there could be substantial induced and/orconstitutive costs, or benefits, associated with switching betweenalternative phenotypic states.PHENOTYPIC INHERITANCEThreshold traits could also generate distinctive patterns of ap-parent inheritance of phenotypic plasticity or canalization, man-ifested as parent-offspring resemblance (Table 2). Such patternscould arise because the threshold trait structure translates addi-tive genetic effects on liability into nonadditive genotypic effectson observed phenotypes (Gianola 1982; Lynch and Walsh 1998,Ch. 25).Specifically, reproduction between parents with differenthighly canalized discrete phenotypes, resulting from liability in-tercepts far from the threshold on opposite sides, could read-ily generate highly phenotypically plastic offspring. This is be-cause resulting offsprings’ liability intercepts could be close tothe threshold, meaning that their phenotypes change in responseto any small environmental deviation. Maintenance (or elimina-tion) of phenotypic plasticity will therefore partly depend on thedegree of assortative (or disassortative) mating with respect tocanalized parental phenotypes. If both alternative phenotypes areexpressed in a population, then phenotypic plasticity could behard to eradicate, even given very strong selection against it, un-less there is strong assortative mating. Equally, given standard in-heritance of liability with Mendelian sampling variance (reflect-ing segregation and recombination), it could be hard to eradicateexpression of both (relatively) canalized phenotypes even givenstrong selection for phenotypic plasticity. Genetic variation forplasticity (and for canalization) in threshold traits is consequentlyunlikely to be purged as readily as could be the case for continu-ously distributed traits (e.g., van Buskirk and Steiner 2009; Saltzet al. 2018). Rather, selection for or against phenotypic plasticitycould potentially drive indirect selection on the mating system,where optimal mate choice given any regime of selection on plas-ticity could depend on the degree of phenotypic plasticity of anyfocal individual.Finally, if females and males have different mean liabilityintercepts and hence show different phenotype frequencies (i.e.,phenotypic sexual dimorphism), then deceptive patterns of phe-notypic variation could arise, which could be incorrectly inter-preted to imply sex-specific genetic architectures or other causesof phenotypic variation (e.g., Lynch and Walsh 1998, Ch. 25).For example, individuals of whichever sex has mean liability in-tercept closer to the threshold could be more phenotypically plas-tic, even without any sex-specific effects on liability-scale reac-tion norm slopes. Evidence of apparent sex-specific genetic dom-inance reversals at large-effect loci could also arise, even in theabsence of any strict dominance reversals. This is because geneticeffects that are purely additive on the liability scale, and identi-cal in both sexes, can become nonadditive on the observed phe-notypic scale, with forms that differ between the sexes if meanliabilities differ (Supporting Information S4).DiscussionThe potential for threshold traits to show distinctive propertiesof phenotypic plasticity compared to traits that are continuouslydistributed on observed phenotypic scales, including differingpatterns of expression, genetic variation, selection, and apparentinheritance, has numerous implications for rationalizing and pre-dicting phenotypic, population, and evolutionary dynamics in thecontexts of environmental variation and change. Core premisesof theory concerning continuously distributed traits include thatgenetic variation in phenotypic plasticity equates to genetic vari-ation in reaction norm slopes, representing G×E; that directionalselection for or against plasticity will cause evolutionary changes200 EVOLUTION FEBRUARY 2022PERSPECTIVEthat respectively increase or decrease reaction norm slopes; thatfixation of phenotypic canalization or of some degree of plasticityimplies erosion of G×E; and that observed degrees of plasticityare directly inherited following standard (additive) quantitativegenetic expectations (Table 2). Such properties underpin mathe-matical and verbal explorations of how combinations of plasticityand microevolution can allow mean values of continuously dis-tributed traits to rematch changing environmentally determinedoptima, and thereby “rescue” declining populations by restoringthe previous ecological status quo (Nussey et al. 2007; Lande2009; Ashander et al. 2016; Chevin and Hoffmann 2017; Arnoldet al. 2019a; Kelly 2019). But such properties and outcomes donot necessarily apply to threshold traits, where inherited reactionnorms are postulated to act on latent liability scales.For such traits, genetic variation in phenotypic plas-ticity does not necessarily require genetic variation inliability-scale reaction norm slopes; evolution of the degree ofphenotypic plasticity could potentially occur through changingintercepts rather than necessarily slopes; strong directional selec-tion on phenotypic plasticity could conceivably generate ratherthan erode complex forms of liability-scale G×E; and substan-tial phenotypic plasticity could readily re-emerge in offspringof highly phenotypically canalized parents, generating persistentpopulation-wide variation in plasticity (Table 2). New theory willconsequently be required to rationalize and predict joint pheno-typic, population, and evolutionary dynamics involving plasticthreshold traits, and thereby discern how such traits could act torescue populations through flexible switching between alterna-tive phenotypic and ecological states rather than by restoring thestatus quo.Some progress can be achieved through mathematical the-ory, aiming to formalize basic principles that are currently out-lined verbally (Table 2) and identify conditions under which theyapply (e.g., Hazel et al. 2004). For example, population frequen-cies of phenotypically plastic versus canalized individuals, andresulting opportunities for selection, will presumably depend onrelative magnitudes of additive genetic means and (co)variancesin liability-scale reaction norm intercepts and slopes alongsidemicroenvironmental variances. Evolved intercepts and slopes,and resulting environmental variances, will in turn affect the im-pact of selection and the consequent maintenance of (cryptic) ge-netic variation. However, the fact that existing evolutionary the-ory involving plasticity explicitly focuses on linear phenotypicreaction norms to facilitate mathematical tractability (e.g., Lande2009, 2019; Ashander et al. 2016) implies that dynamics involv-ing threshold traits will be less readily tractable. Advances mayconsequently require numerical or individual-based simulations,which can more readily encompass key features such as intrin-sically dynamic impacts of selection and genetic (co)variancesin relation to phenotype frequencies, and dependence of plastic-ity on forms of assortative mating. Simulations have previouslybeen used to examine basic properties of threshold traits, such asthe maintenance of substantial additive genetic variation in liabil-ity through selection-mutation-drift balance despite strong direc-tional selection (Roff 1998a), evolution of threshold traits fromcontinuously varying traits (Chevin and Lande 2013), and inter-acting effects of indirect selection, environmental variation, andassortative mating (de Zoeten and Pulido 2020). However, suchapproaches have not yet been applied to explicitly consider evo-lutionary dynamics of threshold trait plasticity.APPLICABILITY OF THE THRESHOLD TRAIT MODELJustification for developing theory for dynamic threshold traitsrequires that key traits that show discrete alternative phenotypesdo reasonably conform to the threshold trait model. Although la-tent liabilities cannot, by definition, be directly observed, the ba-sic adequacy of the threshold trait model has been well demon-strated through quantitative genetics studies based in animalbreeding and medicine, alongside experiments in evolutionary bi-ology, which show that observed patterns of phenotypic variationand microevolution concur with theoretical predictions (Gianola1982; Roff 1994b, 1996; Falconer and Mackay 1996; Lynch andWalsh 1998). However, such work has predominantly focusedon initial development, not on labile phenotypic plasticity (butsee Negussie et al. 2012). Formalizing theory and predictions forlabile plasticity could therefore provide opportunities to evalu-ate the applicability of the threshold model to dynamic discretetraits in wild populations, and highlight pertinent parameters thatneed to be estimated. Such theory could then provide relativelystraightforward explanations for complex observed patterns ofphenotypic variation that are otherwise puzzling or require somespecific or idiosyncratic explanation.As one broad example, dichotomous expression of seasonalmigration versus year-round residence in partially migratorysystems is a critical trait in the context of understanding popula-tion responses to environmental variation and change. Here, anychange in phenotype frequencies, whether due to microevolution,plasticity, and/or microevolution of plasticity, will directly alterseasonal population dynamics and distributions (Reid et al.2018). Migration versus residence has long been conceptualizedas a threshold trait, underpinned by combinations of geneticand environmental effects (Berthold 1988; Pulido 2011; Dodsonet al. 2013). Classic work on blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) usedbreeding designs and artificial selection to show that liability formigration (as expressed in captivity) is highly heritable and posi-tively genetically correlated with measures of migratory activity,and hence that phenotypic expression of migration or residencecould be rapidly eliminated and regained (Berthold 1988; Pulidoet al. 1996; Pulido 2011; de Zoeten and Pulido 2020). Recentanalyses of partially migratory European shags (PhalacrocoraxEVOLUTION FEBRUARY 2022 201PERSPECTIVEaristotelis) revealed patterns of among-individual and within-individual phenotypic variation (i.e., labile plasticity) that arealso highly consistent with verbal predictions from the thresholdtrait model. Specifically, focal populations comprise mixturesof individuals that are nonbreeding season migrants or residents(representing two alternative phenotypes), alongside individualsthat switch between resident and migrant states partway throughthe nonbreeding season, which can be viewed as expressingwithin-season phenotypic plasticity (Reid et al. 2020). Highbetween-year repeatability is evident, such that individuals thatmigrate, remain resident, or switch within one nonbreedingseason are highly likely to do the same again in subsequentnonbreeding seasons, with the expected positive associationsbetween phenotype frequency and repeatability (Reid et al.2020; Acker et al. unpubl. ms.). Yet, between-year plasticityalso occurs and is correlated with within-season plasticity, suchthat individuals that switch between residence and migrationwithin any one nonbreeding season are more likely to switch toresidence or full-season migration in subsequent nonbreedingseasons. This concurs with the expected correlation in plasticityacross temporal scales (Acker et al. unpubl. ms.). These analysesalso revealed episodes of selection for or against within-seasonplasticity that varied substantially among years in relation toenvironmental conditions. Such fluctuating selection impliesvariable costs of plasticity, and resulting episodes of directional,stabilizing, and disruptive selection on underlying liability (Reidet al. 2020; Acker et al. unpubl. ms.).Other partially migratory systems also show mixtures ofphenotypically canalized and plastic residents and migrants, withdifferent levels of individual variation and repeatability acrosstimescales, for example, regarding diel feeding movements inburbot (Lota lota, Harrison et al. 2017), and seasonal migrationversus residence in roach (Rutilus rutilus, Brodersen et al. 2014).Such patterns are commonly discussed in the broad context of thethreshold trait model (e.g., Dodson et al. 2013), but not explic-itly tested against qualitative or quantitative predictions. For ex-ample, resident elk (Cervus elaphus) were more likely to switchto migration across years than vice versa in a population whereresidence was the more frequent tactic, and some individualsswitched repeatedly (Eggeman et al. 2016). These patterns con-cur with expectations given the threshold trait model, yet werenot explicitly considered in that context.Further, apparent nonadditive genotypic effects on migration(and associated age at reproductive maturity) have been docu-mented in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), and interpreted as sex-specific genetic dominance reversals at a large-effect locus thatserve to resolve sexual conflict (Barson et al. 2015; Czorlichet al. 2018). However, because migration timing shows substan-tial sexual dimorphism, similar patterns of phenotypic variationcould readily arise given a predominantly quantitative geneticthreshold trait with sex-specific mean liability intercepts and sex-independent co-dominance at the large-effect locus, and hencewithout requiring any explicit sex-specific dominance reversal(Supporting Information S4). Finally, although assortative mat-ing has been suggested to facilitate evolution of distinct migra-tory types within sympatric breeding populations (Bearhop et al.2005; de Zoeten and Pulido 2020), the implication that such mat-ing could reduce phenotypic plasticity in offspring has not beendiscussed. There is consequently considerable scope for tighterquantitative interpretation, or re-interpretation, of diverse empir-ical results in the context of the threshold trait model, regardingseasonal migration, and regarding numerous other labile dichoto-mous traits.ESTIMATION OF KEY PARAMETERSGiven that observed patterns of phenotypic variation broadly con-form to expectations for threshold traits, the next challenge isto explicitly estimate key quantitative genetic parameters com-prising additive genetic (co)variances in intercepts and slopesof liability-scale reaction norms. Such estimates have sometimesbeen obtained by considering other relevant and directly observ-able continuously distributed phenotypic traits as proxies of the(unobserved) liability. For example, juvenile hormone titers havebeen interpreted as liability to develop winged versus winglessforms in hemimetabolous insects (Roff 1994b), and body size hasbeen interpreted as liability to produce particular morphologicalforms or enact particular reproductive strategies in fish (Dodsonet al. 2013). However, such observable proxy traits are unlikely tosimply equate to liability, and are best viewed as additional traitsthat could be genetically correlated with liability (Roff and Fair-bairn 2007; Debes et al. 2020). In general, such correlated traitscould induce or constrain multivariate evolution, including evo-lution of overall plasticity (e.g., Lande 2019). Resulting indirectselection on threshold trait liabilities could have particularly im-portant effects, by effectively exposing otherwise cryptic geneticvariation to selection (e.g., de Zoeten and Pulido 2020).Indeed, it is not necessary to measure any observable proxytrait to infer key quantitative genetic parameters for the latent li-ability underlying a threshold trait (Falconer and Mackay 1996).Rather, parameters representing liability-scale reaction norm in-tercepts and slopes can in principle be directly estimated givenobservations of dichotomous phenotypes expressed by relativesacross environments. This can be achieved by using statisticalmachinery that is now well established in the form of general-ized linear mixed models (de Villemereuil et al. 2016). Here, aspecified function links observations of discrete phenotypes tounderlying latent values, which could in turn be modeled as anyfunction (i.e., reaction norm) of environmental variables or othercovariates of interest. Such formulations of the threshold traitmodel are well established in statistical and quantitative genetics202 EVOLUTION FEBRUARY 2022PERSPECTIVEtheory, and are explicitly enacted using a probit link (i.e., repre-senting an inverse cumulative normal distribution, Gianola 1982;Hadfield 2015; de Villemereuil et al. 2016; Germain et al. 2018;Debes et al. 2020). Yet, the implications and interpretations ofsuch analyses for concepts of latent versus phenotypic plasticityare still surprisingly infrequently explicitly discussed.Rather, evolutionary ecologists interested in environment-dependent expression of dichotomous traits have reformulatedthe standard threshold trait model into the “(latent) environmen-tal threshold model” (Hazel et al. 2004; Tomkins and Hazel 2007;Pulido 2011; Buoro et al. 2012; Buzatto et al. 2015). Here, thefocal evolving trait is defined as the point on some known envi-ronmental axis (or “cue”) at which each individual or lineage’sphenotype changes state, envisaged as a genetically controlledthreshold value. Hence, in contrast to the standard threshold traitmodel, the environmental threshold model assumes that the en-vironmental axis exerts equal effects across individuals and lin-eages, whereas the threshold value can show additive geneticvariation and evolve (Tomkins and Hazel 2007; Buoro et al. 2012;Buzatto et al. 2015). The standard threshold trait model and theenvironmental threshold model are equivalent (i.e., reparameter-izations of the same conceptual model) in the special case wherethere is zero liability-scale G×E given the standard thresholdmodel, and hence a cross-environment genetic correlation of 1(i.e., zero variation in latent plasticity, Roff 1994b; Hazel et al.2004; Tomkins and Hazel 2007). The point at which an indi-vidual or lineage’s liability crosses the fixed threshold (i.e., itsobserved threshold value) is then directly related to its liabilityintercept (e.g., Fig. 2D). Consequently, the environmental thresh-old model formulation has motivated empirical investigations ofwhether the condition of zero G×E in liability (or in some proxytrait) is approximately valid (Roff 1994b).However, if one ambition is to rationalize and predict evo-lutionary dynamics of plasticity, then it seems highly restrictiveto formulate analyses and conceptual developments through amodel that assumes zero liability-scale G×E. In fact, there isno need to make such an assumption, which arises because theenvironmental threshold model considers environmental and ge-netic effects on separate orthogonal axes of cues versus thresh-olds. This structure can be eliminated by considering joint geneticand environmental effects on the same latent liability, by for-mulating liability-scale reaction norms that could include G×E(Fig. 2C). Indeed, the possibility of both environmental and ge-netic effects on liability was already fully embedded in the origi-nal quantitative genetic threshold trait model, for example, yield-ing theory on heritability on latent liability (and observed phe-notypic) scales (Dempster and Lerner 1950; Lynch and Walsh1998, Ch. 25). Here, the heritability represents the ratio of ge-netic to total variance, and the total variance typically includesa substantial component of environmental variance (Roff 1996).Formulation of a distinct (latent) environmental threshold modelis consequently not really necessary, and has invoked additionalrestrictive assumptions (Roff 1994b; Hadfield 2015). Meanwhile,some articles that are phrased in terms of the environmentalthreshold model in fact approximately implement the standardthreshold model, including interacting latent-scale genetic andenvironmental effects (e.g., Ostrowski et al. 2000).INTERPRETATIONS AND IMPLICATIONSGiven that intrinsic properties of phenotypic plasticity and plas-ticity evolution could differ markedly between threshold traitsand continuously distributed traits (Table 2), it becomes im-portant that traits of biological interest are not misconceptual-ized (e.g., true threshold traits treated as continuously distributedtraits), at least without considering the implications of such con-versions. It might seem implausible that true discrete and con-tinuous traits could be confused or interchanged. However, givenlabile phenotypic plasticity, the distinction between the two maynot always be clear and may be a matter of biological interpreta-tion.For example, the seasonal timing of key life-history events,such as breeding, is now a major focus for theoretical and em-pirical work on plasticity and evolutionary dynamics in relationto environmental change (Nussey et al. 2007; Lof et al. 2012; In-ouye et al. 2019; Radchuk et al. 2019). Here, the focal trait iscommonly defined, measured, and analyzed as the observed dateof event (e.g., egg laying in birds, parturition in mammals, flower-ing date in plants), which is continuously distributed (e.g., Arnoldet al. 2019a,b; Inouye et al. 2019; de Villemereuil et al. 2020).However, biologically, these observed events represent the dateson which individuals switch between approximately discrete phe-notypic states (e.g., “nonbreeding” and “breeding”). They couldconsequently be viewed as manifestations of a threshold trait withlabile plasticity, where most or all individuals cross the thresholdfor reproduction at some point during a season. Quantitative ge-netic analyses that treat observed date as the focal trait are theneffectively using the environmental threshold model, implicitlyinvoking the assumption of zero liability-scale G×E. This couldhinder appropriate evolutionary inference, especially when theobjective in studying breeding date is to test for, or evaluate theimplications of, nonzero G×E (e.g., Nussey et al. 2007; Char-mantier and Gienapp 2014). Further, “date” is unlikely to be theprimary driving environmental variable; indeed mean breedingdates commonly vary substantially among years, implying thatliability-scale reaction norms shaping the transition to breedingrespond to other environmental variable(s) (e.g., Lof et al. 2012;Inouye et al. 2019; de Villemereuil et al. 2020). Microevolution-ary analyses that treat observed event dates as continuously dis-tributed traits, if in fact the true underlying biology is a thresholdtrait with labile plasticity, might consequently give incompleteEVOLUTION FEBRUARY 2022 203PERSPECTIVEor erroneous predictions of evolutionary dynamics, at least undersome circumstances. Indeed, breeding dates often do not showexpected microevolutionary responses to observed directional se-lection, which has been suggested to reflect additional environ-mental or genetic constraints (de Villemereuil et al. 2020). Yet,although studying phenology in terms of time to event and associ-ated reaction norms rather than simply observed events has beenadvocated (Gienapp et al. 2005; Inouye et al. 2019), the meritsand practicalities of treating events as manifestations of a plasticthreshold trait have scarcely been explicitly considered.Overall, therefore, future empirical ambitions should be tofully exploit recent conceptual and empirical developments inevolutionary quantitative genetics to explicitly estimate key pa-rameters defining liability-scale reaction norms and resulting ex-pression of threshold traits, and estimate genetic covariances withother traits and components of fitness. Such analyses will requiresubstantial data on discrete phenotypes of relatives and nonrel-atives distributed across representative environments, and willtherefore require appropriate multivariate axes of environmen-tal variation driving developmental and/or labile plasticity to bemeasured or imposed. Such advances will be challenging, but willbe necessary to predict how complex dynamics of discrete traitscan drive phenotypic, population, and evolutionary responses toenvironmental variation and directional change.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSJMR conceptualized and wrote the manuscript, with substantial concep-tual and editing input from PA.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank Y.

Not surprisingly, the study of phenotypic plasticity is innately interdisciplinary and encompasses aspects of behavior, development, ecology, evolution, genetics, genomics, and multiple physiological systems at various levels of biological organization. From an ecological and evolutionary perspective, phenotypic plasticity may be a powerful means of adaptation and dramatic examples of phenotypic plasticity include predator avoidance, insect wing polymorphisms, the timing of metamorphosis in amphibians, osmoregulation in fishes, and alternative reproductive tactics in male vertebrates. From a human health perspective, documented examples of plasticity most commonly include the results of exercise, training, and/or dieting on human morphology and physiology. Regardless of the discipline, phenotypic plasticity has increasingly become the target of a plethora of investigations with the methodological approaches utilized ranging from the molecular to whole organsimal. In this article, we provide a brief historical outlook on phenotypic plasticity; examine its potential adaptive significance; emphasize recent molecular approaches that provide novel insight into underlying mechanisms, and highlight examples in fishes and insects. Finally, we highlight examples of phenotypic plasticity from a human health perspective and underscore the use of mouse models as a powerful tool in understanding the genetic architecture of phenotypic plasticity",,text,,,'Wiley'
phenotypic plasticity hypothesis,100033243,"Phenotypic Plasticity and Robustness: Evolutionary Stability Theory, Gene Expression Dynamics Model, and Laboratory Experiments",,"Kunihiko Kaneko, Kunihiko Kaneko",2014,"Abstract Plasticity and robustness, which are two basic concepts in the evolution of developmental dynamics, are characterized in terms of the variance of phenotype distribution. Plasticity concerns the response of a phenotype against environmental and genetic changes, whereas robustness is the phenotypefs degree of insensitivity against such changes. Note that the sensitivity increases with the variance, and the inverse of the variance works as a measure of the robustness. First, it is found that the response ratio is proportional to the phenotype variance, as described by ex-tending the fluctuation-response relationship in statistical physics. Next, it is shown that through the course of robust evolution, the phenotype variance caused by ge-netic change decreases in proportion to that by noise during the developmental pro-cess. This evolution, resulting in increased robustness, is achieved only when the noise in the developmental process is sufficiently large; in other words, robustness to noise leads to robustness to mutation. For a system that achieves robustness in the phenotype, it is also found that the proportionality between the two variances also holds across different phenotypic traits. These general relationships for plas-ticity and robustness in terms of fluctuations are demonstrated using macroscopic phenomenological theory, simulations of gene expression dynamics models with regulation networks, and laboratory selection experiments. It is also shown that an optimal noise level compatibility between robustness and plasticity is achieved to cope with a fluctuating environment",,text,"Key Words, fluctuation, noise, canalization, error catastrophe, artificial selection",,

The chapter shows then how Darwinian theories have first favored the second conception, before the emergence of a renewed interest for the first one, which plays the role of an explanans, while the second conception would rather be an explanandum. In so doing, the chapter describes in depth the role of the concept in micro-and macroevolution study. The concept of plasticity is everywhere in the life sciences. As in philosophy, 1 the term can have two meanings: in the active sense, the concept of plasticity is synonymous with """" that which has the power to shape or form """" with the example in biology being the egg cell development, which has the plastic capacity to generate a mul-ti-celled organism; in the passive sense, the concept expresses a """" susceptibility to take on an indefinite number of forms """" , with the example in evolutionary biology being """" phenotypic plasticity """" , which we will define here as an organisms' capacity to express different phenotypes of a single genotype as a function of environmental conditions.

The potential for this to happen depends in part on how well plastic responses are aligned with the additive genetic variance and covariance in traits. Using meta-analysis, we demonstrate that plastic responses to novel environments tend to occur along phenotype dimensions that harbor substantial amounts of additive genetic variation. This suggests that selection for or against environmentally induced phenotypes typically will be effective. One interpretation of the alignment between the direction of plasticity and the main axis of additive genetic variation is that developmental systems tend to respond to environmental novelty as they do to genetic mutation. This makes it challenging to distinguish if the direction of evolution is biased by plasticity or genetic “constraint.” Our results therefore highlight a need for new theoretical and empirical approaches to address the role of plasticity in evolution.This study was funded by a grant from the John Templeton Foundation (60501) and a Wallenberg Academy Fellowship (both to T.U.).

Theory suggests it can through two different mechanisms. Phenotypically plastic organisms can adapt rapidly to new environments through genetic assimilation, or the fluctuating environments that result in phenotypic plasticity can produce evolvable genetic architectures. In this article, I studied a model of a gene regulatory network that determined a phenotypic character in one population selected for phenotypic plasticity and a second population in a constant environment. A history of phenotypic plasticity increased the rate of adaptation in a new environment, but the amount of this increase was dependent on the strength of selection in the original environment. Phenotypic variance in the original environment predicted the adaptive capacity of the trait within, but not between, plastic and non-plastic populations.

phenotypic plasticity hypothesis,584475406,Environmental change and the rate of phenotypic plasticity,10.5061/dryad.tdz08kq2d,"Burton, Tim, Ratikainen, Irja Ida, Einum, Sigurd",2022,"With rapid and less predictable environmental change emerging as the 'new norm', understanding how individuals tolerate environmental stress via plastic, often reversible changes to the phenotype (i.e. reversible phenotypic plasticity, RPP) remains a key issue in ecology. Here, we examine the potential for better understanding how organisms overcome environmental challenges within their own lifetimes by scrutinizing a somewhat overlooked aspect of RPP, namely the rate at which it can occur. Whilst recent advances in the field provide indication of the aspects of environmental change where RPP rates may be of particular ecological relevance, we observe that current theoretical models do not consider the evolutionary potential of the rate of RPP. Although, recent theory underscores the importance of environmental predictability in determining the slope of the evolved reaction norm for a given trait (i.e. how much plasticity can occur), a hitherto neglected possibility is that the rate of plasticity might be a more dynamic component of this relationship than previously assumed.  If the rate of plasticity itself can evolve, as empirical evidence foreshadows rates of plasticity may have the potential to alter the level predictability in the environment as perceived by the organism and thus influence the slope of the evolved reaction norm. However, optimality in the rate of phenotypic plasticity, its evolutionary dynamics in different environments and influence of constraints imposed by associated costs remain unexplored and may represent fruitful avenues of exploration in future theoretical and empirical treatments of the topic. We conclude by reviewing published studies of RPP rates, providing suggestions for improving the measurement of RPP rates, both in terms of experimental design and in the statistical quantification of this component of plasticity.Funding provided by: Norges ForskningsrådCrossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416Award Number: 244046Funding provided by: Norges ForskningsrådCrossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416Award Number: 223257/F50Funding provided by: Norsk institutt for naturforskningCrossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100019715Award Number:The data contained in this dataset was obtained from a literature search performed in December 2021.

We opted to exclude the word """"rate"""" from this search due to the high number of false results that were returned in preliminary trials. This initial search yielded 885 papers. We then scanned the title and abstract (if available) of these papers, excluding cases where it could be determined unambiguously that the rate of plasticity was not a focus of the study. This reduced the initial list to 276 papers. Due to time constraints, we excluded studies where the full text version of the paper could not be located online (n = 16) and then scanned the text of each of the remaining papers, omitting those that (i) were review articles, (ii) implemented a gradual (rather than acute) change in the environmental variable under manipulation, (iii) were performed in field conditions, (iv) did not contain data showing a time-course of change in the phenotypic variable(s) of interest and (v) implemented only a transient treatment exposure to the environmental variable of interest (e.g. heat shock experiments).From each of the 170 papers, we then extracted data for the variables listed below. The abbreviated name used in the data file contained in this dataset is stated in parentheses, along with a brief description of the values each variable could assume: year of publication (year: integer), taxonomic group (taxon.group: categorical - plant/animal/bacteria), species name (species: character), environmental variable subject to manipulation (env.var: character), phenotypic trait(s) measured (trait: character), the acclimation status of the control groups (acc.type.control: categorical - initial-environment/initial- and new-environment/none), number of phenotypic measurements made during time-course of acclimation to new environment (timepoints.treatment: integer), statistical quantification of the rate of plasticity (rate.quant: categorical - yes/no), reference (ref: character). Exploration of the extracted data revealed a high diversity of phenotypic traits. To aid quantitative interpretation, each of the recorded traits was placed into one of 7 categories. Where a given grouping maybe ambiguous, we list several illustrative examples below. The categories were:  life history (e.g. body size, population growth rate), behaviour (e.g. prey search time, swimming speed), thermal tolerance (e.g. CTmin, heat knockdown time), morphological (e.g. body shape, leaf thickness), gene expression (e.g. mRNA level associated with a given gene), bioenergetic (e.g. traits involved in photosynthesis, respiration or energy conversion) and biochemical (e.g. enzyme activities, fluid osmolality, fluid ion concentration). Likewise, a high diversity of environmental variables was also evident in the extracted data. We thus categorized these variables into 13 groups. Again, where there may be potential for ambiguity in a given grouping, we list several examples. The 13 groups were:  pH, carbon dioxide concentration, oxygen concentration, population density, water availability, temperature, predation (e.g. predator kairomones), nutrition (e.g. food quantity, food quality or nitrogen availability), chemical exposure (e.g. exposure to copper or aluminum ions), light (e.g. light intensity, level of UV radiation) and salinity (i.e. salt concentration). Two final groups that require further explanation are physical environment (e.g. water flow, background color) which includes aspects of the physical environment not covered by any of the previous groupings, and a group we termed interaction to describe instances where two environmental variables were subject to simultaneous experimental manipulation (e.g. temperature × food availability).

Phenotypic plasticity is the ability of indi- vidual genotypes to produce different phenotypes when exposed to different environmental conditions (Fusco & Minelli, 2010) and has been shown to be a mechanism by which species respond to climate change (Boutin & Lane, 2014; Crozier & Hutchings, 2014; Seebacher et al., 2015; Stoks et al., 2014). There is evidence that species exhibit- ing high levels of phenotypic plasticity are more success- ful at spreading across environmental gradients (Hahn et al., 2012; Szabó et al., 2018), and it is predicted that phenotypic plasticity contributes to determining the out- come of interspecific competition (Buskirk & Mccollum, 2016; Palkovacs & Post, 2009). Quantifying phenotypic plasticity in individuals is generally straightforward, but it is often more difficult to measure the effects on popu- lations (Merilä & Hendry, 2014; Valladares et al., 2006).

Environment, E  the occurrence of seemingly paradoxical population dy- namical behaviours such as the paradox of enrichment, whereby an increase in available resources causes a desta- bilisation of population's dynamics (Miner et al., 2005), and the hydra effect where an increase in per capita mor- tality results in increased population density (Cameron & Benton, 2004). Disentangling  the  complex  network of inter-dependent individual and population processes necessary to demonstrate how phenotypic plasticity con- tributes to  species  responses  to  environmental  change is inherently difficult using existing model frameworks (Forsman, 2015). In particular, the population dynamic consequences of phenotypic plasticity often manifest as delayed-density dependence (Beckerman et al., 2002) which is known to cause cryptic dynamical behaviours (Lima et al., 1999; Pedraza-Garcia & Cubillos, 2008). Despite the potentially complex  relationship  be- tween individual variation and population response, environment–trait relationships  observed  in  individ- uals are routinely employed to predict the outcome of population processes (Figure 1). For example, in epide- miology environmental–trait relationships are used in parameter-based approaches for calculating the basic reproduction number, R0 (Brand et al., 2016; Mordecai et al., 2017; Parham & Michael, 2010) (expected num- ber of secondary cases produced by a single infection in a completely susceptible population). This implicitly assumes that variation observed in a population's trait distribution is independent of environmental  stressors and population dynamics, such that an averaged trait value suitably represents the population at any given time and location (Liu-Helmersson et al., 2016). This is the mean-field approach and there is an increasing body of evidence that this approach under-represents the impor- tance of variation between individuals and community structure in population ecology (Cator et al., 2019; Fox & Kendall, 2002; McGill et al., 2006; Violle et al., 2012). Consideration of purely stochastic forms of variation has demonstrated that the outcome of population processes such as species persistence do not always follow mean- field predictions (Hart et al., 2016; Morozov et al., 2013). In contrast to environmental or demographic noise, in- dividual variation caused by phenotypic plasticity has a strong mechanistic component, and so can and should be suitably accounted for (Nylin & Gotthard, 2002). To describe the effect phenotypic plasticity has on population dynamics it is key to link trait and effect mechanistically combining empirically derived relation- ships with theoretical methods. For populations with distinct generations this can be addressed using meth- ods such as integral projection models (IPMs) which are widely used to represent trait variation within popula- tions (Childs et al., 2003; Kuss et al., 2008). IPMs impose observed trait distributions upon populations and map changes in these distributions forwards in time to pre- dict long-term and general trends. Due to their simplistic           Current one way predictive frameworks Our interactive predictive framework        F IG U R E 1 Current predictive frameworks typically use environment-trait relationships, such as reaction norms, to predict population responses without consideration of how population processes may alter the traits individuals express. Our framework incorporates environment-trait relationships that interact with population dynamics and trait distributions. This allows the framework to account for the effect of interaction between environment, trait, and population as experienced by many organisms in our predictions of population processes Reaction Norm   Spec. 1  Spec. 2 Environment, E Environment, E Trait Distribution   Population Model = , ,    Trait, T Time, t Trait, T Time, t       Environment, E Proportion, p Trait, T Trait, T Population, N Trait, T Proportion, p Trait, T Population, N | 2408 PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY AS A CAUSE AND CONSEQUENCE OF POPULATION DYNAMICS   j 1 2 3 z 1 2 3 z  representation of plasticity and ease of parameterisation, IPMs are used to make cross-taxa syntheses on global species trends (Salguero-Gómez et al., 2018). However, there is a recognised need for modelling approaches that can consider the effect of detailed intra-generation dy- namics alongside inter-generational dynamics on the ex- pression of phenotypic plasticity and so can predict how these feedback  to  alter  population  processes  (Bolnick et al., 2011; Hendry, 2016; Johnston et al., 2019; Lion, 2018; Lipowsky et al., 2015; Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005; Sgrò et al., 2016; Turcotte & Levine, 2016; Violle et al., 2012). Here, we propose a novel general mathematical frame- work that links experimentally derived environment– trait relationships to well-parametrised stage-structured population models that allow trait distributions to emerge from population–trait–environment interactions (Figure 1). We utilise a continuous-time stage-structured modelling approach, widely used to model organisms with multiple distinct life stages (Murdoch et al., 2003), adapted to represent the persistent and delayed effects of phenotypic plasticity across multiple developmental stages. By using our framework to represent mechanisms of individual variation in response to environmental change, we show that even simple forms of phenotypic plasticity can lead to complex population dynamical responses that previous approaches overlook. This is demonstrated by an application of our framework to a classical population ecology study, Nicholson's blowflies (Nicholson, 1957), where it has been hypothesised that previously unexplained population dynamics can be at- tributed to phenotypic plasticity. This application reveals a rich set of counter-intuitive population-dynamical be- haviours caused by the interaction between phenotypic plasticity and population dynamics.   MATERI ALS AND METHODS We present a modelling framework that  dynamically links the expression of phenotypic plasticity in individu- als to population dynamics. We combine a continuous- time stage-structured population model in the form described in Gurney et al., (1983) (as in Figure 2a), widely used to predict the population dynamics of inter- acting life-stages (e.g. Gurney et al., (1980)), with a set of empirically-derived reaction norms. Models created using our framework are systems of stage-phenotypically structured delay-differential  equations,  within  which, we track cohorts of individuals based on their cumula- tive environmental experience. Each cohort is then as- sociated with a unique phenotype. (Figure 2b). Within our framework an individual's phenotype may consist of multiple traits varying in response to multiple environ- mental factors, both current and historic. This creates a dynamic phenotypic structure that allows multiple phe- notypes to be represented within a population simulta- neously. By using this approach, the distribution of traits expressed within a population is not assumed, as it is in an IPM (Merow et al., 2014), but instead emerges as a feature of empirically verified mechanistic processes. This links individual-level variation in life-history traits to population-level response and so represents the effects of phenotypic plasticity on populations. Our approach is able to represent both intra- and inter-generational forms of phenotypic plasticity, in response to both instantane- ous and delayed environmental  conditions.  Moreover, we can track the effects of multiple environmental cues on single or multiple traits, giving rise to a highly flexible modelling framework.   The general framework for representing phenotypic plasticity in stage-structured population models Variation caused by phenotypic plasticity is often ex- pressed in terms of a reaction norm, a function that de- scribes how an individual's environmental experience alters the phenotype they express (Nylin & Gotthard, 1998) (e.g. food consumed as a juvenile predicts adult body mass). We assume that organisms with similar expe- riences of their environment express the same phenotype and to represent this we create multiple linked copies of the Gurney et al. framework (as in Figure 2b). Each copy corresponds to a unique set of environmental conditions and individuals move through this structure on a path determined by  their  current  and  historical  experience of the environment. This allows us to track cohorts of individuals that share the same  environmental  history and so represent the effects of phenotypic plasticity on populations. Consider  a  stage-structured  population  with life- stages where phenotypic plasticity is expressed accord- ing to d reaction norms r1 (a) , . . . ,  rd (a) in response to environmental cues a (t) = a1 (t) , . . . ,  az (t) . For com- putational tractability, we discretise each environmental cue, j (t), into mj subintervals and denote by jp the mid- point of the pth subinterval of the discretisation of aj (t). We define an environmental class to be a vector of length with entries that consist of one midpoint from each dis- cretised environmental cue, that is,  a1l , a2l , a3l , . . . ,  azl      , where lj  ∈ 1 , . . . ,  mj . We define g: ℝz → Ωa such that g (a (t)) = a1l , a2l , a3l , . . . ,  azl , if aj (t) takes values within the lth subinterval of aj (t). The function g defines a mapping of onto the discretisation of .

This framework represents a continuous age structure by a discrete number of developmental classes e.g. eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults. (b), The most general form of the novel framework, where an individual's experience of the environmental cues in each developmental stage determines the phenotype it expresses as partitioned by the environmental classes. (c), The new framework adapted to represent developmental plasticity in life-stage 2. It is assumed that individuals experience an environmental cue in life-stage 1 that does not effect individuals in life-stage 1 but results in the expression of phenotypic plasticity in subsequent life-stages. This allows the reduction of the phenotypic structure in life-stage 1 to just a single class, N1,Tot = ∑m j = 1 N1,j . (d), The new framework adapted to represent a maternal effect in response to an environmental cue experienced by parents in life-stage n that manifests as phenotypic plasticity in life-stage 1 which is then assumed to have no effect on subsequent life-stages  and we denote the set of all such vectors (environmental classes) by Ωa. We assign an ordering to the elements of the set of environmental classes Ωa (see Supplementary dNi,j (t) dt = Ri,j (t) − Mi,j (t) − Di,j (t) ,  (1) Information 6 for an example ordering) and let ak denote the kth element of the ordered set, i.e. the kth environmen- tal class. Thus, g (a) = ak if g (a) is the kth element of the ordered set Ωa. Environmental classes define cohorts of individuals that have experienced a shared environmental for i ∈ 1 , . . . ,  n, and   j ∈ 1 , . . . ,  m. The death rate is Di,j (t) = i,j (t) Ni,j (t) where i,j (t) is the mortality rate of individuals in life-stage i and environmental class j.

We assume that an individual's current and historic experience of the environment  completely  determines the phenotype an individual acquires when it matures R1,j (t) =  m  k = 1  wkj(a(t))  n  v = 1  fJv,k (t)Nv,k (t)    ,  (2) from life stage i to i + 1 or is born into stage life stage 1 at time t. This permits the effects of environmental vari- ation to be deferred to future developmental stages or generations. As we discretise the environmental cues this means there are a discrete number  of phenotypes  that can arise in the framework. The traits that these pheno- types  express  are  calculated  using  the  reaction  norms according to, rk (g (a)). This process pre-defines both the traits individuals express and the range of environmental conditions that give rise to those individuals.   Incorporating phenotypic plasticity into stage- structured models  Denote the number of individuals in life-stage i and en- vironmental class j at time t by Ni,j (t). Denote by Ri,j (t) the rate of recruitment of individuals into life-stage i and environmental class  j, Mi,j  (t) the rate of maturation out of life-stage i and environmental class j, and Di,j (t) the death rate in life-stage i and environmental class j.

The transition functions, wkj (a (t)), are the mechanism through which the environment acts to express phenotypic plasticity within the model. Equation 2 represents the birth of new individuals into the first life-stage and environmen- tal class j by parents from across all environmental classes and life-stages. The birth term, Pv,k (t) Nv,k (t) describes the number of new individuals produced by parents in life- stage  and environmental class k, and is summed across all life-stages and environmental-classes to account for all new individuals entering the population. The transition functions wkj (a (t)) then determine the proportion of the new births that are assigned to environmental class j de- pendent on the environmental state. The number of individuals recruited into life-stage i and environmental class j is equal to the number of indi- viduals maturing out of life-stage i − 1that are assigned to environmental class j.

Hence, et al., 2002). In blowflies, body size is linearly related to the number of ovarioles an adult has (Vogt et al., 1985) which determines the maximum number of eggs the adult can produce (Jannicke Moe et al., 2002), and so larval competition alters the maximum potential fecundity of adults. We regard the intensity of larval competition for food resources as an environmental cue, altering maxi- mum potential adult fecundity and through pupal stage survival.

The exact form of the transition function, wkj (a (t)), is left unspecified as the way individuals transition from one environmental class and life-stage to the next is case specific. However, the choice of wkj (a (t)) is subject to the   constraints   0 ≤ wkj (a (t)) ≤ 1, ∀ j, k ∈ 1, . . . ,  m   and amount of adult food supplied was reduced from an “un- limited” amount to a more limiting 1000 mg after around 600 days. The reduction of adult food resulted in an in- creased average adult population density, and the stabili- sation of the previously regular population cycles. This is somewhat counter-intuitive, since a decrease in available m   j = 1 wkj (a(t)) = 1. Although the transition functions are resource substantially increased the average number of individuals and stabilised the previously regular oscilla- stage-independent, the environmental vector a (t) is able to refer the state of each environmental cue independently and so can consider the sequence of past environments that an individual has encountered.   RESULTS Application of the novel modelling framework to Nicholson's blowflies To demonstrate the insights that can be gained from our framework we applied it to Nicholson's classical blowfly study (Nicholson, 1957), which aimed to describe how populations adjust in response to changes in their abi- otic environment. In this study, the population dynam- ics of Lucilia cuprina (Wiedemann, 1830) were examined under different competitive conditions. In each culture, food was supplied separately to larvae and adults and both food supplies were  replenished  daily.  Cultures were maintained for over two years and the number of adults and eggs present was recorded every two days. The results of Nicholson's study have been extensively discussed in theoretical ecology (Bakker, 1963; Glyzin, 2018; Gurney et al., 1983; May, 1986; Wood, 2010). In Nicholson's experiment, blowflies experienced competition for food their larval and adult stages. Competition for food between adult blowflies reduces fecundity if individuals cannot acquire enough protein to mature all their eggs (Vogt et al., 1985). Larval com- petition for food reduces adult body size and the proba- bility of survival through the pupal stage (Jannicke Moe | 2412 PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY AS A CAUSE AND CONSEQUENCE OF POPULATION DYNAMICS   tions—an example of the paradox of enrichment (Roy & Chattopadhyay, 2007). Nicholson hypothesises that the  population  dynam- ics observed in the blowfly culture can be explained by phenotypic plasticity induced by larval competition. Adults in the period of unlimited adult food were ob- served to produce many eggs. When these eggs hatched into larvae, they experienced high levels of competition for larval food. This caused very few larvae to gain suffi- cient mass to pupate successfully, resulting in increased pupal mortality and low adult numbers in the next gen- eration. When adult food was limited, an  increase  in adult competition resulted in fewer eggs being produced. The lower number of eggs resulted in fewer larvae and a larger amount of food being available per larva, sub- sequently reducing larval competition and juvenile mor- tality causing an increase in average adult population density. We evaluate evidence for Nicholson's hypothesis and heuristic arguments using the modelling framework derived here to represent phenotypic plasticity induced by resource competition in blowfly populations.   Model description To formulate a model that represents phenotypic plastic- ity in blowfly populations we extend a previously derived mean-field model from Gurney et al. (1983), detailed in Supplementary Information 3, that considered only the instantaneous effects of adult competition on blowfly population dynamics. We introduce reaction norms re- lating through pupal-stage survival (Jannicke Moe et al., | 2413 BRASS et al.

In the culture adults blowflies were given unlimited food for 610 days, represented by KA = 2000 mg, which converts to 1800 mg of food supplied. After day 610 the amount of adult food supplied, KA, was then reduced to KA = 1200 mg, which converts to 1000mg of food supplied daily.

As this is an example of developmental plas- ticity the model takes the form of Figure 2c, for examples of models where we consider maternal effects or multiple environmental cues with a cumulative effect over multi- ple stages see Supplementary Information 5. We assume eggs are laid into a single egg class, within which all individuals express the same phenotype (i.e. we assume no maternal effects). After a fixed developmental period, eggs hatch into a single larval class where again all individuals express the same phenotype. When a larva matures into a pupa, the amount of food that it obtained in the larval stage is determined by dividing the total food provided over the larval period by the number of individu- als present in the culture over that period assuming scram- ble competition. The food obtained by an individual in the larval period is subsequently used to determine the traits that the individual expresses as a pupa and as an adult. is dropped completely for terms relating to larvae. As we only consider a single environmental cue (larval food) the set of environmental classes, Ωa, consists only of the midpoints of a (t). Denote by L (t) the number of larvae at time t and by Aj (t) the number of adults at time t in environmental class j. Associated with each environmental class are the maxi- mum fecundity of adults qj, and survival through the pupal and juvenile stages S  . Recruitment into the larval stage is j denoted RL (t) and recruitment of larvae to adults in envi- ronmental class  j is denoted R   (t). The environmental j classes are parametrised by discretising an adapted reac- tion norm for through pupal-stage survival (Jannicke Moe et al., 2002) and a reaction norm for maximum adult fe- cundity is approximated from various sources (Webber, 1954). A detailed discussion of how the model is parame- trised is detailed in Supplementary Information 7. As a proxy for the environmental cue, total protein obtained per larvae over the course of the larval period, We abbreviate the previously introduced N dropping the i,j notation we use the average protein available per larvae per day over the course of the larval period. We assume larvae i and replacing the N by a more descriptive letter reflecting the life-stage, for example, L is used for larvae and A for adults. Similarly, as adults are the only explicitly modelled life-stage that expresses phenotypic divide the available food equally allowing the cue to be expressed as follows: KLrL Adult Population Potential Fecundity Pupal survival | 2414 PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY AS A CAUSE AND CONSEQUENCE OF POPULATION DYNAMICS   t − r plasticity (pupae are implicitly modelled due to a lack of density dependence (Gurney et al., 1983) the j subscript a(t) = ,   t L(s)ds L  (4) | 2415 BRASS et al.

This is  converted  into  a  derivative  for  ease  of computation time t will have identical experiences of larval competition over the duration of the larval period, and so will express the same traits. We further assume that this developmental plasticity is irreversible.

The stability analysis for this model is detailed in Supplementary Information 9. The model was simulated in R (R Core Team, 2020) using the dL (t) = R  (t) − R     t − S – L (t) , (6) package PBSddesolve (Couture-Beil et al., 2019). dt L L L L L  dAj (t) = R   (t) − 8  A (t) for    j ∈ 1 , . . . ,  m,  (7) Simulating population dynamics in the Nicholson dt Aj A   j blowfly culture under experimental conditions  da (t) – a2 (t) L (t) − L  t − rL  (8) The  model  simulated  under  replica  experimental  con- = , dt KLrL Recruitment terms are given by  m ditions shows good qualitative and quantitative resem- blance to experimental data from Nicholson's blowfly culture (Figure 3a), capturing the culture's dynamical behaviour before and after food  limitation.

After the food  was  restricted  to 1000 mg at 610 days, the oscillations dampen, and the average population density substantially increases cap- turing the change in dynamical behaviour observed in Nicholson's culture. Although the population density of the simulated blowflies matches the experimental data for j ∈ 1 , . . . ,  m where I   t − rE   is an inoculation term that begins the dynamics (Kot, 2001), and represents the introduction of larvae into the system at t = 0, and qj and S are determined by the reaction norms. j We assume that adults compete equally for the total available food regardless of phenotype, and so the in- stantaneous effects of adult competition are represented the amplitude of the oscillations does not match. This mismatch can be explained by the high sensitivity of the model to food supply, a discussion of which, accompa- nied by food supplies which correctly predict both am- plitudes, is provided in Supplementary Information 4. Initially, the population exhibits temporal cycles in the dominant phenotypes (Figure 3b,c). In the time periods where no new adults are being recruited, the phenotypic by e − ATot(t − E )∕KA where ATot m j = 1 Aj indicates compe- composition of the pupal and adult population does not change, resulting in the flat regions of Figure 3b,c. After tition  across  all  phenotypes.  The  transition  function wj (a (t)), determines the fraction of individuals entering environmental class Aj (t) at time t, and is defined food restriction, the range of phenotypes  expressed within the population is greatly reduced. Pupae  and adults in this period belong to a group of closely related environmental classes of individuals with relatively low trait values. As there is no difference between the distri- wj (a (t)) = 1, if g (a (t)) = aj , 0, otherwise (11) butions of maximum fecundity and through pupal stage survival, we hereafter only discuss fecundity. As our model extends a previously derived non-plastic blowfly population model by Gurney et al. it is natural for j ∈ 1 , . . . ,  m. This choice of wj (a (t)) restricts recruit- ment of individuals into a single environmental class based on that individual's experience of previous larval com- petition and indicates that maximum adult fecundity is uniquely determined by past experience of larval competi- tion. This restriction is appropriate, as due to the assump- = | 2416 PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY AS A CAUSE AND CONSEQUENCE OF POPULATION DYNAMICS   tion that all food is split equally, larvae being recruited at to question whether the population dynamics observed in Figure 3a can be attributed to the non-plastic popu- lation model. To test this, we simulate the non-plastic blowfly model, the formulation of which is provided in Supplementary Information 3. The non-plastic model overestimates the average adult density in both food conditions, predicts a decrease in adult density when | 2417 BRASS et al.   resource availability decreases, and maintains the same population dynamics before and after  the  resource change as can be observed in Figure 4 (see Supplementary Information 3 for further details).   Understanding the wider effects of phenotypic plasticity and population dynamic interactions To explore how robust the population dynamics observed in the blowfly system are to conditions beyond those in Nicholson's experiment, we simulate the population tra- jectories for a wide range of possible combinations of adult and larval food supplies. For each food supply we record the average adult population density (Figure 5a), the average potential fecundity (maximum number of eggs an individual could produce in conditions of excess adult food, Figure 5b), the average observed fecundity (the number of eggs an individual actually produces in the context of competitive pressures within the popula- tion, Figure 5c), and the difference between the average potential and observed fecundities (Figure 5d). The model predicts that the blowfly population ex- hibits one of three dynamical behaviours. In the leftmost region of Figure 5a–d, increases in larval food supply do  not  change  the  abundance  or  fecundity  (potential or observed) of adults. This suggests that in this region the population is limited most by the amount of adult food available. The population in this region consists of a small number of phenotypes with similar trait values (c.f. the small range of colours in the lines representing the abundance of individuals  in  each  environmental class in Figure 5e and point (e) in Figure ). In the right- most region of Figure 5a–d, increases in adult food sup- ply do not change the abundance or fecundity of adults, suggesting that the availability of larval food is a limit- ing factor. The phenotypes expressed within the popu- lation are more diverse and the population's phenotypic composition changes during the course of a population cycle (c.f. the larger range of coloured lines in Figure 5g and point (g)). In the central region (the dark segment in Figure 5a), increases in either adult or larval food supply change the abundance and fecundity of adults. The adult population exhibits dampened oscillations and a small number of phenotypes with low trait values (Figure 5f and point (f)). This suggests that in this region the pop- ulation is limited by the availability of both larval food and adult food. We conclude that the balance of resource availability between adult and larval blowflies governs the dynamical behaviour of the blowfly population. The population dynamics we observe are therefore charac- terised by the interaction between the two sources of density dependence: the instantaneous effects of adult competition and the delayed effects of larval competition through developmental plasticity. Nicholson observed that when a culture initially sup- plied with 50g of larval food was supplied with 1g of adult food that ‘the oscillation [of the blowfly population] was comparatively slight and had lost almost all evidence of periodicity, whereas any appreciable departure from the rate of one gram of ground liver per day in either direc- tion resulted in the increase in the amplitude of oscilla- tion’. The model predicts that when a population with a low adult food supply is supplied with increasingly more adult food that there is a sharp rise and then fall in av- erage adult density as observed in Figure 5a. Similarly, when a population with a relatively low larval food sup- ply is provided with increasingly more larval food, we observe a similar sharp rise and fall in average adult den- sity. The behaviour Nicholson describes is precisely the behaviour that our model predicts, demonstrating that phenotypic plasticity is a mechanism by which the para- dox of enrichment can be reconciled. The predictions the model makes about the link be- tween traits expressed by individuals and population responses  are  somewhat  counter-intuitive  and  would be difficult to anticipate from reaction  norms  alone.

The larval food provided is KL = 50000 mg in each simulation and the adult food has been selected such that the average potential fecundity trait is 25, KA = 351 mg, KA = 901 mg and KA = 4151 mg, respectively   reasonable to predict that individuals are most repro- ductively successful when potential fecundity is high. However, in Figure 5b–d we see that the food conditions that produce individuals with the highest average poten- tial fecundity are also those that prevent this from being exploited and are associated with low average observed fecundity and consequently low reproductive success. By comparison, conditions that produce  individuals  with low average potential fecundity allow those individuals to achieve this potential, meaning that individuals  in these conditions are on average more reproductively suc- cessful despite their lower trait value. Therefore, the rela- tive contribution of high and low trait-valued individuals to the intensity of future larvae competition changes dynamically according to the environmental conditions the population is subject to. This demonstrates that the seemingly reasonable assumption we made from the re- action norm alone, that high trait value corresponds to high reproductive success, does not hold (Reed et al., 2013). We predict that individuals with traits that are in- dicative of high individual performance, such as aver- age potential fecundity and average observed fecundity, arise from environmental conditions where the popula- tion is least abundant and most  unstable.  When  aver- age observed fecundity is highest (rightmost regions of Figure 5a–d) population density is lowest. Conversely,  when the population density is highest, and the oscilla- tions are damped (central regions of Figure 5a–d), the average observed fecundity is low, and the average po- tential fecundity is at a minimum. This shows that over most food conditions average potential fecundity and average observed fecundity are poor predictors of indi- vidual and population success. Even when average trait value is a good predictor of observed fecundity (right- most region of Figure 5a–d) the population's dynamics are regulated by phenotypic plasticity and so would be misrepresented by an approach that uses averaged trait values. Conversely, when average trait value is a bad predictor of fecundity (leftmost regions of Figure 5a–d) an averaged trait approach correctly predicts the pop- ulation dynamics (as can be observed by comparing Figure 4 to Figure 5e). The food amounts supplied in the simulations shown in Figure 5e–g were selected to produce populations with the same average potential adult fecundity. Despite each population sharing the same average trait value, each population exhibits distinct dynamics and trait distribu- tions which would be overlooked by an approach using averaged trait values. Only by accounting for trait vari- ation between individuals arising from the cumulative effect of each individual's experience is it possible to cap- ture the population-level effects of these three scenarios. This highlights the need to consider the individual and Adult Population Adult Population Adult Population | 2419 BRASS et al.   population-level consequences of  phenotypic  plasticity in a unified framework akin to what we derive here.  DISCUSSION We demonstrate that the interaction between phenotypic plasticity in individuals and population-level effects can be a source of rich population dynamical phenomena. The disconnect between individual and population per- formance demonstrated in the example of Nicholson's blowflies, although certainly not universal, provides a mechanistic explanation of how pressures that are mala- daptive for individuals can be beneficial for populations and vice versa (Edelaar & Bolnick, 2019; Louthan et al., 2013; Reed et al., 2013; Weiner et al., 2017). By represent- ing the mechanisms by which individual variation and population-level processes interact, we generate insights into how populations adapt to changing environments, which is crucial for understanding phenomena such as ecological tipping points (Dakos et al., 2019). Further, our findings support numerous previous studies propos- ing that failure to represent the effects of individual vari- ation on populations is more consequential than simply mis-estimating demography (Bolnick et al., 2011; Lloyd- Smith et al., 2005; Sgrò et al., 2016; Violle et al., 2012), as we demonstrate that patterns in individual variation can drive complete changes in the dynamical behaviour of the system being considered. This is corroborated by observational studies where it has been found that the re- sponse of populations to interventions was influenced by individual variation (Cameron & Benton, 2004; Cameron et al., 2013). The framework is broadly applicable to sys- tems where interaction between  population  dynamics and trait is important in determining the outcome of a process of interest. For example, when considering insect vectors of diseases or crop pests (e.g. mosquitoes or lo- custs) both abundance and trait to interact to determine the health or  economic  risk  posed  (Chandrasegaran et al., 2020; Sword et al., 2010). Developing the model for Nicholson's blowflies was considerably simplified as we consider a well-studied model organism under controlled laboratory conditions. Although reaction norms are widely available across a broad range of taxa, outside of laboratory settings ad- ditional sources of environmental variation require the inclusion of reaction norms of higher dimension (i.e. a reaction norm considering the effect of temperature and con-specific density on development rate). However, our framework is designed to represent complex systems and so this should not pose an obstacle to implementation. For species where particular environment–trait relation- ships are not fully quantified or are missing entirely, due diligence must be observed in determining how sensitive the dynamics are to these uncertainties. For example, reaction norms are often most uncertain at environmen- tal extremes (Brady et al., 2013) and so this uncertainty would need careful consideration when using our frame- work to predict dynamics at population range limits. Although we demonstrate that  individual  variation can change and be changed by population processes, we do not predict when trait variation alters the outcome of these processes. In invasion biology, metrics derived from reaction norms are often used to predict the com- petitive viability of native and invasive species (Richards et al., 2006). Although the approach of using reaction norms directly accurately predicts the success of some invasive species (Knop & Reusser, 2012; Luo et al., 2019), it fails to explain the success of others (Muth & Pigliucci, 2007). This inconsistency limits the usefulness of reac- tion norms as a general predictor of a species invasive- ness (Hulme, 2008; Palacio-López and Gianoli, 2011). Here, we demonstrate that if one directly compares re- action norms without also considering a greater ecolog- ical context, one may arrive at erroneous conclusions. Therefore, it is important to determine more generally when reaction norms alone are sufficient to predict pop- ulation dynamics and in doing so reconcile the role of phenotypic plasticity in biological invasions and popu- lation biology.

Steinerc",2014,"Why are some traits constitutive and others inducible? The term costs often appears in work addressing this issue but may be ambiguously defined. This review distin-guishes two conceptually distinct types of costs: phenotypic costs and plasticity costs. Phenotypic costs are assessed from patterns of covariation, typically between a focal trait and a separate trait relevant to fitness. Plasticity costs, separable from phenotypic costs, are gauged by comparing the fitness of genotypes with equivalent phenotypes within two environments but differing in plasticity and fitness. Subtleties associated with both types of costs are illustrated by a body of work addressing predator-induced plasticity. Such subtleties, and potential interplay between the two types of costs, have also been addressed, often in studies involving genetic model organisms. In some in-stances, investigators have pinpointed the mechanistic basis of plasticity. In this vein, microbialwork is especially illuminating andhas three additional strengths. First, infor-mation about the machinery underlying plasticity—such as structural and regulatory genes, sensory proteins, and biochemical pathways—helps link population-level stud-ies with underlying physiological and genetic mechanisms.

They can either respond directly, by means of phenotypic plasticity, or they can slowly adapt through evolution. Yet, how phenotypic plasticity links to evolutionary adaptability is largely unknown. Current studies of plasticity tend to adopt a phenomenological reaction norm (RN) approach, which neglects the mechanisms underlying plasticity. Focusing on a concrete question - the optimal timing of bacterial sporulation we here also consider a mechanistic approach, the evolution of a gene regulatory network (GRN) underlying plasticity. Using individual-based simulations, we compare the RN and GRN approach and find a number of striking differences. Most importantly, the GRN model results in a much higher diversity of responsive strategies than the RN model. We show that each of the evolved strategies is pre-adapted to a unique set of unseen environmental conditions.

A commonly predicted cost to plasticity is that plastic genotypes are likely to suffer from developmental instability. Adaptive plasticity requires that the developing organism can in some way sense what environment it is in or how well it is performing in that environment. These two information pathways—an """"environmental signal"""" or a """"performance signal"""" that indicates how well a developing phenotype matches the optimum in the current environment—can differ in their consequences for the organism and its evolution. Here, we consider how developmental instability might emerge as a side-effect of these two distinct mechanisms. Because a performance cue allows a regulatory feedback loop connecting a trait to a feedback signal, we hypothesized that plastic genotypes using a performance signal would be more developmentally robust compared to those using a purely environmental signal. Using a numerical model of a network of gene interactions, we show that plasticity comes at a cost of developmental instability when the plastic response is mediated via an environmental signal, but not when it is mediated via a performance signal. We also show that a performance signal mechanism can evolve even in a constant environment, leading to genotypes pre-adapted for plasticity to novel environments even in populations without a history of environmental heterogeneity.Here are explanations of the meaning of each column in the dataset:  meanP: Mean phenotypic value over all replicated development of the genotype of interest.  sdP: Standard deviation in phenotypic value among all replicated development of the genotype of interest.  meanW: Mean fitness over all replicated development of the genotype of interest.  sdW: Standard deviation in fitness among all replicated development of the genotype of interest.  trait_optima: Optimal trait in the environment considered.  nbGenes: Number of genes.

The potential for this to happen depends in part on how well plastic responses are aligned with the additive genetic variance and covariance in traits. Using meta-analysis, we demonstrate that plastic responses to novel environments tend to occur along phenotype dimensions that harbor substantial amounts of additive genetic variation. This suggests that selection for or against environmentally induced phenotypes typically will be effective. One interpretation of the alignment between the direction of plasticity and the main axis of additive genetic variation is that developmental systems tend to respond to environmental novelty as they do to genetic mutation. This makes it challenging to distinguish if the direction of evolution is biased by plasticity or genetic “constraint.” Our results therefore highlight a need for new theoretical and empirical approaches to address the role of plasticity in evolution.</p",,Article/Letter to editor,"Cryptic genetic, Evolvability, Phenotypic accommodation, Phenotypic plasticity, Variation",,

INTRODUCTIONStochastic factors exert a strong influence on ecologicaland evolutionary dynamics (Lande et al. 2003;Lenormand et al. 2009). Temporal variation in climate,for example, can affect individual performance, patternsand intensity of natural selection, and density-dependentinteractions, by driving physical habitat changes andaltering the distribution and abundance of interactingspecies (Coulson et al. 2001; Grant & Grant 2002;Stenseth et al. 2002). A central goal of modern populationbiology is therefore to understand how stochastic environ-mental variation affects individual fitness and, in turn,population and evolutionary dynamics (Coulson et al.2006; Tuljapurkar et al. 2009).Phenotypic plasticity and environmental canalizationrepresent two contrasting biological phenomena linkingindividual-level and population-level responses toenvironmental variation (Schlichting & Pigliucci 1998).Phenotypic plasticity refers to the ability of a single geno-type to produce different phenotypes under differentenvironmental conditions. Environmental canalization,in contrast, occurs when genetic expression is insensitiveto the environment—the same phenotype is producedregardless of environmental variation (Debat & David2001).Plastic responses such as changes in development,behaviour and allocation of resources to competingdemands potentially allow individuals to match their phe-notypes (or those of their offspring, in the case of plasticmaternal effects) to spatial or temporal variations intheir abiotic and biotic environments (Bradshaw 1965;Scheiner 1993; Gotthard & Nylin 1995; Schlichting &Pigliucci 1998; Sultan 2003). In order for phenotypicplasticity to be effective, however, organisms must oftenbe able to accurately assay or forecast environmentalchallenges affecting their individual fitnesses (Levins1963; Bradshaw 1986; Moran 1992; Scheiner 1993;De Jong 1999; Tufto 2000; Lande 2009). To do so,they often use indirect cues. Seasonal environments, forexample, are characterized by predictable sequences ofchange in environmental variables such as photoperiodand temperature, but also by random variation in selectivefactors across years (e.g. timing of optimal temperaturesfor growth and survival, peak food availability, predationpressure).

One potential reason forthis is that the distinction between effects of phenotypicchanges on absolute fitness and relative fitness is rarelymade explicit. Selective pressures on phenotypic plasticityare governed by variability in the relative fitnesses ofphenotypes across environments, with plastic genotypesbeing favoured when reliable cues allow close pheno-type–environment matching. Consequences of plasticityfor population growth and persistence, on the otherhand, depend on how it affects absolute fitness (meanper capita offspring production per time step), which inturn influences the sensitivity of demographic parametersto stochastic environmental changes occurring within thelifetimes of individuals.Caswell (1983) suggested that adaptive plasticity inregulatory traits might act to reduce variance in highlyelastic demographic parameters (those for which relativelysmall changes can have a large impact on fitness),providing a mechanism by which absolute fitness can bebuffered against random temporal environmental fluctu-ations (see also Pfister 1998; Gaillard & Yoccoz 2003).The potential fitness-buffering effects of plasticity,however, should be a function of the reliability of environ-mental cues, which can change when cues and selectivefilters become decoupled. Climate change, habitat altera-tions or species introductions, for example, can reducethe reliability of cues as indicators of optimal behaviouralor life-history decisions, rendering previously adaptiveplastic responses less effective, or even maladaptive, inthe new environmental context (Schlaepfer et al. 2002).Extreme or novel environmental stresses can also directlyinduce maladaptive plastic responses, independent ofwhether cue reliability changes (Ghalambor et al. 2007).Here we present a stochastic, individual-based modelto test the hypothesis that the effect of plasticity on popu-lation viability in a stochastic environment depends on thereliability of environmental cues. We focus on plasticity,independent of evolution, in order to complementnumerous other studies that have considered the role ofevolution in population persistence, independent ofplasticity (reviewed in Kinnison & Hairston 2007).Environmental heterogeneity was characterized by twocomponents: magnitude and predictability of stochasticfluctuations. The former was simulated as stochastic tem-poral variations in the optimal phenotype (cf. Lynch &Lande 1993; Lande & Shannon 1996), while the latterwas modelled as the correlation between the value ofan arbitrary environmental cue, with its own stochasticcomponent, and that of the optimal phenotype(figure 1). In this case, ‘predictability’ reflects reliabilityof an indirect environmental cue as an indicator of theoptimum phenotype in the present or at some futuretime period. Such predictability should not be confusedwith the ability of a plastic phenotype to produce thephenotype–3–2–10123(a)(b)(c)phenotype–3–2–10123phenotype–3–2–10123cue–3 –2 –1 0 1 2 3Figure 1. Illustration of three different scenarios of environ-mental predictability (simulated data). In each panel,phenotypic optima are plotted against cue values, simulatedby drawing each from a standard bivariate normal distri-bution (means of 0 and standard deviations of 1), with adifferent correlation between the cue and the optimum ineach panel. The optimal reaction norm in each case isshown as a solid black line, and the reaction norms of twoindividuals are also shown: a non-plastic genotype that pro-duces the same phenotype in every environment (dashedline), and a plastic genotype (dotted line; slope ¼ 0.5).(a) The correlation between the cue and the optimum is per-fect (r ¼ 1), so the optimal reaction norm has a slope of 1 andintercept of 0. The plastic genotype has higher averageexpected fitness than the fixed genotype (the fitness of a gen-otype is maximized by minimizing the sum of squareddeviations between environment-specific phenotypes andcorresponding optimal phenotypes). (b) The cue and theoptimum are completely decoupled (r ¼ 0), so the optimalreaction norm has a slope of 0 as well as an intercept of0. The fixed genotype has higher expected fitness than theplastic genotype under these circumstances. (c) The cueand the optimum are 40 per cent correlated, so the optimalreaction norm has a slope of 0.4. The plastic genotype hasa slope closer to the optimum slope, and consequentlyhigher fitness, than a non-plastic genotype.3392 T. E. Reed et al. Demographic consequences of plasticityProc. R. Soc. B (2010) optimum phenotype when cues are reliable, which insteaddetermines the absolute fitness and demographic contri-butions of various plastic phenotypes in our model.We used the model to address the following questions,which are difficult to answer quantitatively using existingmodels and theory. Under what conditions does adaptiveplasticity have a stabilizing effect on populationdynamics? How strong must the correlation between thecue and selective optimum be for plasticity to significantlyreduce extinction risk? Can phenotypic responses towardsthe current environmental optimum have adversedemographic consequences for the population underconditions of altered cue reliability? Our results showthat reaction norm slope, cue reliability, magnitude ofstochastic variation and density dependence interact innonlinear ways to affect population dynamic processesand persistence.2. MATERIAL AND METHODS(a) Model overviewWe simulated a closed but freely mixing finite sexual popu-lation, with discrete generations (e.g. an annual plant oranimal). The model kept track of information on individuals,such as their ontogenetic stage (juvenile, sub-adult or matureadult), phenotypic values and fecundity. Ordering of eventsin the model was (i) reproduction, (ii) density-dependentjuvenile mortality, and (iii) phenotypic selection on offspringthat survived density-dependent mortality.Individual relative fitness was determined by a single con-tinuously distributed character, which responded plasticallyto environmental variation. Timing traits are good examplesof plastic quantitative characters—such as germinationtiming in annual plants (Freas & Kemp 1983), spawntiming in fish (Genner et al. 2010) or laying date in birds(Visser et al. 2009)—each of which might be triggered byphotoperiod, temperature or some other cue. Mean(absolute) fitness in the population W TOTAL per generationhad three components:W TOTAL ¼W JW SF ¼ l; ð2:1Þwhere W J is the mean survival of juveniles (density-depen-dent), W S is the mean survival of sub-adults (phenotype-dependent) and F is the mean per capita fecundity. l istherefore the multiplicative population growth rate per gener-ation. The model was parametrized such that expectedgeometric mean l  1 (on average, the population replaceditself) when the mean phenotype was at the optimum andthere was moderate stabilizing selection (see below). Anychange in the optimum therefore resulted in a drop in meanfitness within a generation, in the absence of a plastic response.(b) Characterizing plasticityWe adopted a linear reaction norm approach to model plas-ticity (Tufto 2000; Lande 2009; Chevin & Lande 2010),where individual phenotypic responses to the environmentwere characterized by an elevation (expected trait value inthe average environment, which varied around zero) andslope (degree to which the phenotype changes as the environ-ment changes). The reaction norm slope in this case can beconceived either as a separate quantitative character, poten-tially correlated at the genetic level with the trait elevation,or as the outcome of environment-dependent gene regulation(Via et al. 1995).The model was seeded with 1000 juveniles at the begin-ning of each simulation run. The initial phenotype of eachindividual was formulated aszi ¼ pi þ biEt ; ð2:2Þwhere zi is the realized trait value for the i th individual. Here,pi (an individual’s intercept—analogous to a ‘permanent’environment effect in the standard quantitative geneticsmodel) represents an individual’s deviation from the popu-lation mean phenotype that is independent of E. The initialmean phenotype in the average environment, pi, was set to0 (which corresponded to the expected optimal phenotypeacross environments; see below). bi is an individual’s plasticresponse to the environmental cue E. Environmental fluctu-ations were expressed as random deviations from the initialenvironmental state Et¼0 ¼ 0. The mean plastic response bwas designated at the beginning of each run, and Et variedacross generations within runs but was kept constant withingenerations (coarse-grained temporal environmentalheterogeneity).The random variables pi and bi were drawn from indepen-dent Gaussian distributions with means pi ¼ 0 and b,respectively, and standard deviations sp ¼ 1 and sb ¼ 0.1(the main effects reported in the results were qualitativelyinsensitive to these dispersion parameters). Note thatalthough we model developmentally fixed plasticity (onceexpressed, the trait does not change over the lifetime of indi-viduals), our model is general and can easily be extended toplastic traits that are developmentally labile or reversible(Nussey et al. 2007).(c) SurvivalIndividuals were passed through two survival filters, the firstbeing density-dependent survival WJ from the juvenilestage to the sub-adult stage. Here, we used a stage-specificBeverton–Holt function (Moussalli & Hilborn 1986):WJ ¼1ð1=S þNJ=KÞ:NJ is the number of juveniles, S the intrinsic survival from thejuvenile to sub-adult stage (survival at very low density) andK the carrying capacity of sub-adults. Survival through thisstage was independent of phenotype.Subsequent survival WS from sub-adult to adulthood wasa function of phenotype, and independent of populationdensity and phenotype frequency (hard viability selection).We used a Gaussian fitness function to model stabilizingselection (Lynch & Lande 1993):WS ¼ exp ðzi  uÞ22s2v !;where u is the optimal value of z and sv is the width(standard deviation) of the fitness function. When themean phenotype was at the optimum (i.e. z ¼ u), the strengthof stabilizing selection was inversely proportional to s2v, andindividuals with phenotype zi¼ u had a survival of 1 (how-ever, with any phenotypic variance, the mean survival atthis stage was less than 1). We used a selection strength ofsv ¼ 3 (i.e. width of fitness function ¼ 3 phenotypic stan-dard deviations), which is equivalent to moderate selection(Kingsolver et al. 2001; Estes & Arnold 2007).Beverton–Holt parameters were chosen such that at car-rying capacity the juvenile survival was approximately 0.5Demographic consequences of plasticity T. E. Reed et al. 3393Proc. R. Soc. B (2010)(default values were S ¼ 0.75 and K ¼ 1500). A hypotheticalperfectly adapted population with equal survival probabilityfor all individuals would have a total survival to adulthood of0.5, and with a mean per capita fecundity of 2 (the valueused in all simulations) would stabilize at approximately 500individuals. Sensitivity of the results to Beverton–Holt par-ameters is described in the electronic supplementary material.(d) Environmental stochasticity and predictabilityEnvironmental stochasticity was modelled as a stationarywhite noise process (Lande & Shannon 1996), by assumingthat the optimal phenotype varies stochastically aroundsome expectation. The optimum u and the environmentalcue E were drawn at each time step from a zero-mean bivari-ate normal distribution with equal variances and covariancesu,E ¼ rsusE, where r is the correlation between theoptimum and the cue. In the case of a perfect correlation(r ¼ 1), the theoretical optimal plastic response perfectlytracks fluctuations in the selective environment (figure 1a).Conversely, with no relationship between the cue and theoptimum (i.e. r ¼ 0), individuals cannot reliably predict thefitness consequences of producing different phenotypes,and plasticity is theorized to have no adaptive benefit, andpotentially a net cost (figure 1b; Moran 1992).For simplicity, we assumed that variance in the cue andthe optimum was the same, reflecting a situation where inter-annual variation in plasticity cues (e.g. temperature early inthe season) is approximately on scale with interannual vari-ation in the factor(s) determining fitness (e.g. temperatureor food supply later in the season). Stochastic changes inthe optimum (hereafter termed environmental stochasticity)were in squared units of phenotypic standard deviations. Toput this in context, consider a hypothetical example of temp-erature-sensitive flowering date in an annual plant. If thephenotypic standard deviation in flowering dates among indi-vidual plants within a year is 7 days, and the standarddeviation in optimal flowering date across years is 21 days,then the variance in u would be 9 units (i.e. the square of 3phenotypic standard deviation units). If the between-yearvariance in temperatures is also 9 (8C2), then in any givenyear there is an approximately 34 per cent chance that thetemperature might be 38C higher than usual (i.e. 1 s.d.above the mean). A plastic genotype with a reaction normslope of þ0.5 would be expected to flower 3.5 days (half aphenotypic standard deviation) later in such a year, relativeto its expected flowering date in an average year. Note thatthe units for reaction norm slopes are phenotypic standarddeviations per unit change in the cue.(e) Scenarios exploredWe considered a reaction norm’s direction to be nominally‘adaptive’ when the phenotypic response to a reliable cue isin the direction of the optimum for the current environment(Ghalambor et al. 2007). Nominally adaptive norms of reac-tion occur in our model when both r and the reaction normslope (b) are positive. Outcomes were the same when the sym-metrical situation of a negative correlation and negativereaction norm slope was modelled and are thus not shown.Extant populations are not expected to have evolved plasticresponses that result in phenotypes further from the fitnessoptimum than would be produced by weaker plastic or cana-lized responses. However, anthropogenic environmentalchanges (e.g. reductions in cue reliability) could render pre-viously adaptive reaction norms sub-optimal in newenvironmental contexts. Hence, it is important to examinedemographic outcomes for a range of combinations of reactionnorm slope, environmental stochasticity and cue reliability.We examined a number of population-level responsemetrics, including average degree of phenotypic mismatch(the average absolute deviation of the observed meanphenotype from the optimum phenotype, calculated across150 generations), likelihood of extinction (proportion of500 replicate populations where zero-reproducing adultsremained after 150 generations), arithmetic mean populationsize across the last 100 generations and coefficient ofvariation (CV) in population size across the last 100 gener-ations. The independent variables were reaction norm slope(which could vary from 0 to þ1), environmental stochasticity(six values explored, from 1 to 11 in increments of 2) and cuereliability (which could vary from 0 to 1). The model wascoded in Cþþ.3. RESULTSThe demographic effects of plasticity depended stronglyon cue reliability. Arithmetic mean population size, N,and the magnitude of intergenerational fluctuations inpopulation size for a given magnitude of environmentalstochasticity depended on the match between the meanphenotype and the optimum phenotype. Without plas-ticity, the mean phenotype was invariant regardless ofchanges in the optimum, and populations were thereforephenotypically mismatched much of the time (figure 2,black line). The initial drop in mean absolute fitnesscaused by this mismatch resulted in negative populationgrowth. Non-plastic populations were often able to stabil-ize and persist at smaller N following an initial drop inpopulation size (because juvenile survival was compensa-tory) so long as environmental stochasticity was not toogreat (see the electronic supplementary material).Because fecundity was held constant, changes in popu-lation growth (whether positive or negative) from onegeneration to the next solely reflected the product of den-sity-dependent juvenile survival and sub-adult survival,0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0123cue reliabilityaverage mismatchFigure 2.

Different colours represent differentreaction norm slopes (black ¼ no plasticity, pink ¼ slope of0.11, blue ¼ slope of 0.33, red ¼ slope of 0.66, green ¼slope of 0.99; see main text for explanation of units).3394 T. E. Reed et al. Demographic consequences of plasticityProc. R. Soc. B (2010)the latter being inversely proportional to the degree ofphenotypic mismatch.Without plasticity (flat reaction norm), the meanand variance of population size depended solely on themagnitude of environmental stochasticity (electronicsupplementary material) and cue reliability had noeffect because the phenotype was unresponsive to cues(figure 3a,b). However, when the reaction norm slopewas positive, and cue reliability was positive and high,the mean population size was close to carrying capacityand fluctuations in population size were greatly reduced(figure 3d). In contrast, when cue reliability was low,strong plasticity had a negative effect on the mean popu-lation size, and caused larger population fluctuations(higher SD and CV of population size; figure 3c).Figure 2 shows why: the mean phenotype of populationsexhibiting strong plasticity deviated more, on average,from the environmentally determined optimum pheno-type than did populations with less plasticity, andconsequently suffered cumulative reductions in absolutefitness.In general, higher environmental stochasticity led togreater reductions in population size, increased variancein population growth rates and higher extinction risk(figure 4; electronic supplementary material). Theseeffects were strongly modulated, however, by the degreeof plasticity, and the effects of plasticity in turn dependedstrongly on cue reliability. At high levels of environmentalstochasticity and low cue reliability, stronger plasticity(large positive reaction norm slopes) greatly increasedthe likelihood of extinction (figure 4). Extinction riskfor plastic populations dropped off rapidly with increasingcue reliability. At intermediate levels of environmentalstochasticity and cue reliability greater than approxi-mately 0.6, extinction risk was essentially nil forpopulations exhibiting any capacity for plasticity, com-pared with around 20 per cent for non-plasticpopulations (figure 4c). At cue reliabilities less thanapproximately 0.5 and intermediate levels of environ-mental stochasticity, however, extinction risk wasconsiderably higher for more plastic populations com-pared with less plastic populations (figure 4c,d, comparegreen and red curves with blue and pink curves).Decreased extinction risk with higher cue reliabilitywas relatively gradual for low and medium plasticitypopulations at intermediate levels of environmental sto-chasticity (figure 4c,d, pink and blue curves), but verysteep for highly plastic populations (red and greencurves). At higher levels of environmental stochasticity(figure 4e,f ), extinction probability was close to 1 fornon-plastic and low-plasticity populations (black andpink curves) regardless of cue reliability, and also formedium- to high-plasticity populations at cue reliabilitiesless than approximately 0.4 (blue, red and green curves).At higher cue reliabilities, high-plasticity populations hadmuch higher persistence probabilities (figure 4f, red andgreen curves). At low levels of environmental stochasti-city, populations could persist without any plasticity(figure 5a,b). At higher levels of stochasticity, theminimum amount of plasticity required for persistencewas much lower when cue reliability was higher(figure 5c,d).Varying the strength of density dependence affectedabsolute extinction probabilities, but did not substantiallyalter the relative effects of plasticity on population viabi-lity (electronic supplementary material).

DISCUSSIONEcologists and conservation biologists have long debatedthe relative importance of factors affecting populationpersistence in variable environments. Empirical studiesof wild populations clearly show that stochastic changesin density-independent factors (e.g. weather) can be amajor driver of temporal fluctuations in population size(Coulson et al. 2001; Stenseth et al. 2002) and, in somecases, population extirpations (Ehrlich et al. 1980;McLaughlin et al. 2002). Yet organisms occupyinghighly variable environments display a remarkable rangeof adaptations that allow them to maintain positive fitnessacross a broad range of conditions, achieved through acombination of homeostatic, plastic and bet-hedgingmechanisms (Caswell 1983). The idea that individualscan adaptively adjust their behaviour, development andallocation of resources to competing demands is a corner-stone of behavioural ecology (Krebs & Davies 1997).Given the strong emphasis currently placed on questionsof species persistence in the face of global environmentalchange, it is somewhat surprising that the demographicconsequences of plasticity have received so little attentionin the population ecology literature.We present a flexible model for conceptualizing andquantifying the effects of plasticity on populationdynamics and persistence, where the key parameter link-ing proximate cues and ultimate costs of selection is thecorrelation between an indirect environmental cue andthe optimal phenotype each generation (cue reliability).Two major results emerged from our analysis. First, wefound that when cue reliability is high and environmental1.0(a)(c)(e)(b)(d )( f )0.80.60.40.201.00.80.60.40.2extinction probabilityextinction probabilityextinction probability01.00.80.60.40.20 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8cue reliability cue reliability1.0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Figure 4. The proportion of replicate populations (out of a total of 500) that went extinct within 150 generations, plottedagainst cue reliability. The panels show outcomes for different magnitudes of environmental stochasticity (variance in thecue and the optimum; see main text for explanation), and different colour curves represent different strengths of plasticity(as indexed by b, the reaction norm slope; black: b ¼ 0, pink: b ¼ 0.11, blue: b ¼ 0.33, red: b ¼ 0.66, green: b ¼ 0.99).

Demographic consequences of plasticityProc. R. Soc. B (2010) stochasticity is moderate, a little plasticity can go a longway: even a relatively weak plastic response (low reactionnorm slope) has a strong positive effect on populationpersistence under these circumstances (figure 5). Anadaptive plastic response (plasticity towards the optimumunder a reliable cue) allows individuals to tightly matchtheir phenotype to the variable conditions encountered(figure 2), and therefore maintain high survival. As aresult, population dynamics are more stable: mean popu-lation size remains close to carrying capacity, fluctuationsin population size are greatly reduced and extinction riskis low.Second, we found that demographic consequences ofplasticity depend in a nonlinear, non-additive way oncue reliability and the magnitude of environmental sto-chasticity, both of which can change as a result ofnatural causes or anthropogenic impacts. When environ-mental stochasticity is high but cue reliability is low,plastic phenotypes do a poor job tracking environmentalfluctuations. The average absolute deviation of themean phenotype from the optimum phenotype is largerfor populations exhibiting strong plasticity under thesecircumstances, compared with populations with reducedplasticity or canalized (non-plastic) populations(figure 2). These populations over-respond to anunreliable cue and hence more frequently ‘overshoot’the optimum. The fitness function was symmetrical andstabilizing about an optimum that fluctuated acrossgenerations. Consequently, deviations in the meanphenotype either side of the optimum reduced meanabsolute fitness, and the greater the absolute deviation,the greater the per-generation reduction in fitness. Thisnegative demographic effect of strong plasticity outweighsits positive effects under these circumstances, and conse-quently population dynamics become less stable (figure 3,lower mean and higher variance in population size) andextinction risk increases (figure 4).(a) The importance of reliable cuesAlthough our model focuses on absolute fitness and itsdemographic consequences, it nonetheless producessome findings consistent with past explorations of theevolution of plasticity based on relative fitness. Environ-mental predictability has long been emphasized in theevolutionary literature on phenotypic plasticity (Levins1963; Bradshaw 1986; Gabriel & Lynch 1992; Moran1992; Gavrilets & Scheiner 1993; Scheiner 1993; DeJong 1999; Tufto 2000).

Reed et al. 3397Proc. R. Soc. B (2010) Moran (1992) showed that in the absence of predictivecues, random assignment of phenotypes to each environ-ment would achieve a better level of phenotype matchingthan plasticity. Our findings are in broad agreement withthese early theoretical results, and our modelling frame-work may be considered analogous in many parts to thatof Tufto (2000), who showed using an analytical quantitat-ive genetic model that incomplete phenotype–environmentmatching evolves when developmental cues and selectiveoptima are only partially correlated (see also Gavrilets &Scheiner 1993; de Jong 1999; Lande 2009).As noted by Caswell (1983), phenotypic plasticity pro-vides a potential mechanism by which organisms canbuffer key vital rates against temporal or spatial environ-mental heterogeneity. If this is true, one would expectplastic populations to have lower variance in fitness in astochastic environment (and hence higher geometricmean fitness, even if the arithmetic mean is the same)compared with non-plastic populations. Our modelshows that this basic prediction is upheld only whencues are reliable. When cues are less informative (e.g.cue reliabilities less than approx. 0.5 for intermediatemagnitudes of environmental stochasticity; figure 2), thedemographic costs of strong plasticity can outweigh thebenefits, and extinction risk increases as a nonlinear func-tion of cue reliability. Notably, these demographic costsoccur in our model even without explicit considerationof intrinsic costs of plasticity (e.g. production, mainten-ance and information-acquisition costs; DeWitt et al.1998). The results suggest that strong plasticity shouldbe rare in situations where temporal covariation betweenindirect cues and environmental factors affecting individ-ual fitnesses is low (e.g. plastic responses involving longtime lags, relative to the time scale of environmental varia-bility; Padilla & Adolph 1996). To the extent that greatervariability in the vital rates of plastic phenotypes reducestheir geometric mean fitness when cues are completelyunreliable, plasticity is expected to be disfavoured inlieu of relative trait canalization, or bet-hedging, in unpre-dictable environments (Gillespie 1974; Moran 1992).A major challenge for many taxa is that climate changeand other forms of anthropogenic disturbance might dis-rupt correlations between proximate cues and ultimatefitness-determining factors, such as that between season-ally changing day length and thermally regulatedinvertebrate abundance (Visser et al. 2004; Nussey et al.2005; Visser 2008), reducing the accuracy of pheno-type–environment matching, and in some casesthreatening population viability (e.g. Both et al. 2006).Although such empirical examples of cue disruptionoften involve fitness costs of limited or maladaptive plas-ticity under directional environmental change, our modelclearly suggests that net environmental change is not aprerequisite for concern. Many environmental timeseries are inherently ‘noisy’ and show considerable year-to-year variation relative to long-term trends. In suchcases, environmental stochasticity coupled to reducedreliability of cues could also imperil populations. In thefield of conservation biology, such cue failures have beentermed ‘evolutionary traps’ (Schlaepfer et al. 2002),recognizing that evolved responses to environmental cuescan ensnare populations when anthropogenic disturbancesmake cues unreliable indicators of optimal responses. Overtime frames relevant to management (generally less than 50years), many populations could face greater demographiccosts from imperfect plasticity (as a result of reducedreliability of cues) coupled with strong environmentalstochasticity than they might from limits on evolutionaryor plastic responses to comparatively subtle environmentaltrends. In such cases, natural selection would be expectedto favour compensatory changes in reaction norms or theuse of alternative, more reliable cues.(b) General applicability and potential refinementsof the modelWe made a number of simplifying assumptions in ourmodel. First, we assumed that reaction norms werelinear—a typical assumption when modelling charactersthat are not themselves major fitness components(Gavrilets & Scheiner 1993; Tufto 2000; Lande 2009;Chevin & Lande 2010). For characters more directlylinked to fitness, nonlinear reaction norms might bemore realistic (e.g. thermal performance curves; Gabriel &Lynch 1992; Kingsolver et al. 2004), and further model-ling would be required to assess the consequences forpopulation dynamics. Second, we assumed that plasticresponses and selective pressures were density- andfrequency-independent. In some situations, both plasticresponses and their fitness consequences might bedependent on population density or the frequency ofother genotypes adopting similar strategies, with poten-tially complex consequences for population dynamics(Ernande & Dieckmann 2004; Plaistow & Benton 2009).Third, we did not model genetic variation in elevationor slope of reaction norms (genotype by environmentinteractions). We sought to assess the effects of plasticityindependent of evolution, so as to complement modelsthat have considered evolution independent of plasticity(reviewed in Kinnison & Hairston 2007). Nonetheless,this distinction is somewhat artificial, and the capacityfor evolution of plasticity might be a crucial factor affect-ing population persistence, as suggested under directionalenvironmental change (Visser 2008; Lande 2009;Chevin & Lande 2010). Lande (2009) and Chevin &Lande (2010) recently showed, for example, that follow-ing an abrupt directional change in the environment,plasticity (even if only partially adaptive) can significantlyreduce the demographic cost of maladaptation, while sub-sequent evolution of the reaction norm slope can restoreadaptation much quicker than evolution not affectingthe slope of the norm (i.e. elevation evolution). Somewhatcounterintuitively, however, our simulations under sto-chastic environmental variability (with no directionalchange component) show that if cues and environmentalfilters become increasingly uncoupled, then genotypeswith reduced plasticity might in fact have higher absolutefitness and odds of persistence than those with greaterplasticity. Although stronger plasticity might be expectedto evolve when environments change or become morevariable, selective pressures on reaction norms willdepend heavily on cue reliability and relative magnitudesof directional environmental change and stochasticenvironmental variation (i.e. the signal-to-noise ratio).In conclusion, we show that the effect of environ-mental stochasticity on population dynamics ismodulated by phenotypic plasticity. Potential bufferingeffects of plasticity on demography hinge on the existence3398 T. E. Reed et al. Demographic consequences of plasticityProc. R. Soc.

Given thatenvironments might become both more variable andunpredictable in the future owing to anthropogenicinfluences, incorporating these phenotypic mechanismsinto techniques such as population viability analysiscould improve our ability to predict how populationsmight respond.This work was made possible by generous funding from theGordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and facilitation fromthe Natural Center for Ecological Synthesis and Analysis,Santa Barbara, CA, USA.

With increasing plasticity, the effect of environmental predictability on population size becomes increasingly positive, and the effect on CV increasingly negative in sign (i.e. the CV went down, which reduced extinction risk). At high plasticity (0.99), population size fluctuates only a tiny amount around carrying capacity (500 adults) when environmental fluctuations are predictable; conversely, when fluctuations are unpredictable, mean population size is much lower and the CV is much higher (this effect is due to higher variance in N, and not just a lower mean). Other panels: As the magnitude of environmental variability was increased, the reductions in average population size and the increases in variability in population size were accentuated. The effects of environmental predictability also became more pronounced (stronger slope differences across plasticity treatments).

We assume that individuals experience two discrete environments probabilistically in time (as a Markov process) and that there are two different phenotypic states, each yielding the highest fitness in one of the two environments. We compare the expected fitness of a phenotypically fixed individual to that of an individual whose phenotype is induced to produce the better phenotype in each environment with a time lag between experiencing a new environment and realization of the new phenotype. Such time lags are common in organisms where phenotypically plastic, inducible traits have been documented. We find that although plasticity is generally adaptive when time lags are short (relative to the time scale of environmental variability), plasticity can be disadvantageous for longer lag times. Asymmetries in environmental change probabilities and/or the relative fitnesses of each phenotype strongly influence whether plasticity is favoured. In contrast to other models, our model does not require costs for plasticity to be disadvantaeous; costs affect the results quantitatively, not qualitatively",,text,"phenotypic plasticity, inducible phenotypes, spatiotemporal variability, stochastic environment, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Evolution, Other Ecology and Evolutionary Biology",,Scholarship @ Claremont

phenotypic plasticity hypothesis,26750460,Overcoming maladaptive plasticity through plastic compensation,,"Matthew R.J. MORRIS, Sean M. ROGERS",2013,"Most species evolve within fluctuating environments, and have developed adaptations to meet the challenges posed by environmental heterogeneity. One such adaptation is phenotypic plasticity, or the ability of a single genotype to produce multiple environmentally-induced phenotypes. Yet, not all plasticity is adaptive. Despite the renewed interest in adaptive phenotypic plasticity and its consequences for evolution, much less is known about maladaptive plasticity. However, maladaptive plasticity is likely an important driver of phenotypic similarity among populations living in different environments. This paper traces four strategies for overcoming maladaptive plasticity that result in phenotypic similarity, two of which involve genetic changes (standing genetic variation, genetic compensation) and two of which do not (standing epigenetic variation, plastic compensation). Plastic compensation is defined as adaptive plasticity overcoming maladaptive plasticity. In particular, plastic compensation may increase the likelihood of genetic compensation by facilitating population persistence. We provide key terms to disentangle these aspects of phenotypic plasticity and introduce examples to reinforce the potential importance of plastic compensation for understanding evolutionary change [Current Zoology 59 (4): 526–536, 2013]",,article,"Homeostasis, Canalization, Ecological speciation, Standing genetic variation, Genetic compensation, Countergradient variation, Zoology, QL1-991",Current Zoology,'Oxford University Press (OUP)'
phenotypic plasticity hypothesis,158758170,Data from: The combined effects of temporal autocorrelation and the costs of plasticity on the evolution of plasticity,10.5061/dryad.4p30k,"Siljestam, Mattias, Östman, Örjan",,"Adaptive phenotypic plasticity is an important source of intraspecific variation, and for many plastic traits the costs or factors limiting plasticity seem cryptic. However, there are several different factors that may constrain the evolution of plasticity, but few models have considered costs and limiting factors simultaneously. Here we use a simulation model to investigate how the optimal level of plasticity in a population depends on a fixed fitness cost for maintaining a potential for plasticity or an incremental fitness cost for producing a plastic response in combination with environmental unpredictability (environmental fluctuation speed) limiting plasticity. Our model identifies two mechanisms that act, almost separately, to constrain the evolution of plasticity: 1) The fitness cost of plasticity scaled by the non-plastic environmental tolerance, and 2) the environmental fluctuation speed scaled by the rate of phenotypic change. That is, the evolution of plasticity is constrained by the high cost of plasticity in combination with high tolerance for environmental variation, or fast environmental changes in combination with slow plastic response. Qualitatively similar results are found when fixed and incremental fitness costs of plasticity are incorporated, although a larger degree of plasticity is selected for with an incremental cost. Our model highlights that it is important to consider direct fitness costs and phenotypic limitations in relation to non-plastic environmental tolerance and environmental fluctuations, respectively, to understand what constrains the evolution of phenotypic plasticity",,info:eu-repo/semantics/dataset,,,Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS)

Indeed, organisms live in complex environments where numerous factors can impact the phenotypic expression of traits (inter‐environment axis), possess multiple traits that can influence each other's expression (inter‐trait axis) and differ in their genetic background (inter‐genotype axis), which can not only impact the traits' values but also their plasticity. We addressed six questions related to phenotypic plasticity: (a) do different environmental gradients show similar effects on a given trait? (b) Are the effects of two environmental gradients on a trait additive? (c) Do different traits show similar plastic response to a given environmental gradient? (d) Do the (co)variances between traits vary across environmental gradients? (e) Do genotypes differ in their plastic response to a given environmental gradient? (f) Are some genotypes more plastic than others across all traits? We designed a microcosm experiment using the protist Tetrahymena thermophila aimed at encompassing all these aspects of phenotypic plasticity. We exposed 15 distinct genotypes to 25 combinations of temperature and nutrient availability and assessed the plasticity of five phenotypic traits. Our results show strong differences in the plastic response depending on the environmental gradient, not only regarding the shape of the reaction norm of the different traits tested, but also in the overall plasticity of the organisms. We did not find any covariance between traits that was consistent across all environments. Overall, our results suggest independent impacts of the environmental dimension considered on the observed plastic response.

However, despite this adaptive assumption, the nature of selection on plasticity within populations is still poorly documented. Here, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of estimates of selection on thermal plasticity. Although there is a large literature on thermal plasticity, we found very few studies that estimated coefficients of selection on measures of plasticity. Those that did do not provide strong support for selection on plasticity, with the majority of estimates of directional selection on plasticity being weak and non-significant, and no evidence for selection on plasticity overall. Although further estimates are clearly needed before general conclusions can be drawn, at present there is not clear empirical support for any assumption that plasticity in response to temperature is under selection. We present a multivariate mixed model approach for robust estimation of selection on plasticity and demonstrate how it can be implemented. Finally, we highlight the need to consider the environments, traits and conditions under which plasticity is (or is not) likely to be under selection, if we are to understand phenotypic responses to rapid environmental change.

Hartmann*,2020,"Abstract  This paper explores a hypothesis that considers the question how pressure may shorten the healing time of a hematoma or contusion. The purpose is to present a mathematical model for predictions based on the hypothesis that can be quantitatively compared to measurements. The time trajectory of the fluid volume in the hematoma is modeled by two rate equations, with rate parameters linked to healing and fluid transfer mechanisms. The flux of fluid leaving the hematoma pocket is assumed to be pressure dependent, consistent with Starling’s principle, which asserts that the flux through a tissue layer is equal to the pressure gradient across the layer multiplied by the tissue hydraulic conductivity. Two contributions to the pressure are skin elasticity and applied compression. Shape measurements on two hematomas were made over the 10-week healing time. Model parameters are in fair agreement with values reported previously for wound contraction speed, tissue hydraulic conductivity, and skin elasticity",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/article, publication-article",Keywords: Starling's principle; Pressure hypothesis; Hematoma; Healing time trajectory.,,
propagule pressure hypothesis,33048381,Pulmonary capillary pressure. A review,,"Ganter, CG, Jakob, SM, Takala, J",2006,"Pulmonary capillary pressure (Pcap) is the predominant force that drives fluid out of the pulmonary capillaries into the interstitium. Increasing hydrostatic capillary pressure is directly proportional to the lung's transvascular filtration rate, and in the extreme leads to pulmonary edema. In the pulmonary circulation, blood flow arises from the transpulmonary pressure gradient, defined as the difference between pulmonary artery (diastolic) pressure and left atrial pressure. The resistance across the pulmonary vasculature consists of arterial and venous components, which interact with the capacitance of the compliant pulmonary capillaries. In pathological states such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and high altitude or neurogenic lung edema, the longitudinal distribution of the precapillary arterial and the postcapillary venous resistance varies. Subsequently, the relationship between Pcap and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) is greatly variable and Pcap can no longer be predicted from PAOP. In clinical practice, PAOP is commonly used to guide fluid therapy, and Pcap as a hemodynamic target is rarely assessed. This approach is potentially misleading. In the presence of a normal PAOP and an increased pressure gradient between Pcap and PAOP, the tendency for fluid leakage in the capillaries and subsequent edema development may substantially be underestimated. Tho-roughly validated methods have been developed to assess Pcap in humans. At the bedside, measurement of Pcap can easily be determined by analyzing a pressure transient after an acute pulmonary artery occlusion with the balloon of a Swan-Ganz catheter",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/article, info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion, NonPeerReviewed",,,'Edizioni Minerva Medica'

The work presented in this thesis stems from the hypothesis that subatmospheric pressure is not a hemolytic mechanism, and thus, can be utilized safely.    The first portion of the thesis concentrates on the effect of subatmospheric pressure on erythrocytes. A static pressure apparatus is described that prevents bubble formation in blood at pressures below vapor pressure. A second apparatus is presented for the study of erythrocyte damage by pressure induced pipe flow. The plasma free hemoglobin (PFHB) generated by positive pressure induced flow is compared to that generated by subatmospheric pressure induced flow. The results from these experiments show that subatmospheric pressure is not a hemolytic mechanism.    The second portion of the thesis investigates cavitation in blood. To study cavitation inception in blood, a Cavitation Susceptibility Meter (CSM) and a syringe-pump flow apparatus were designed. The CSM and flow apparatus were used in a sheep model to measure the nuclei content of in vivo blood. At tensions $\le$120 kPa, the nuclei content of arterial blood was determined to be $\le$2.7 per liter of plasma, with venous blood having $\le$0.5 per liter of plasma. From bubble stability theory, the nucleus radii were calculated to be 0.3 $\mu$m. It was also shown that a tension of 120 kPa ($-$127 kPa, gauge) does not cause erythrocyte lysis, further validating that subatmospheric pressure is not hemolytic.    To study the hemolytic potential of cavitation, an analytical model was formulated based on the Rayleigh-Plesset equation, and the assumption that erythrocyte lysis is caused by the straining flow generated by a cavitating bubble. To validate the model, in vitro experiments with the CSM and flow apparatus were performed. At cavitation event rates up to 9 events/sec (270 nuclei per liter of plasma), the increase in PFHb was only 1 mg/dl, as predicted by the analytical model. Higher event rates could not be achieved without flow separation. Recirculating studies with the CSM showed that an increase in PFHb correlated with the formation of attached cavitation.PhDApplied SciencesBiological SciencesBiomedical engineeringBiophysicsHealth and Environmental SciencesMedicineUniversity of Michigan, Horace H.

KEYWORDS: Volume replacement; hemodynamics; hemorrhagic shock; cardiac function; vasodilation.INTRODUCTIONMany critically ill patients are hemodynamically unstable. This instability may be caused by cardiac dysfunction, vasodilation, hypovolemia or the association of these factors. Independent of hemodynamic behavior, patients are subjected to volume infusion or withdrawal at some point during their hospitalization.1-4 In these situations, the correct and early definition of intravascular content is essential to avoid tissue ischemia, resulting in multiple organ dysfunction.4-6 Therefore, the correct diagnosis of fluid status must be accurately and rapidly achieved to avoid both hypoperfusion related to volume depletion and fluid overload followed by unnecessary infusion. Hence, accurate hemodynamic monitoring methods are necessary to help us to perform fluid management.4,7,8Pulse pressure respiratory variation (PPV) has generally been demonstrated to be much more accurate for the detection of fluid responsiveness than cardiac filling pressures.9-12 The former method is also more reliable than other dynamic parameters, such as systolic pressure respiratory variation (SPV) or stroke volume respiratory variation (SVV), and it can recognize volume contraction 190CLINICS 2010;65(2):189-94Vasodilation increases pulse pressure variation, mimicking hypovolemic status in rabbitsWestphal GA et al.earlier than the others.9,10,13 Hence, PPV has become largely recommended to guide volume expansion in patients with hemodynamic instability.9-12We have recently reported pulse oximetry wave variation as a noninvasive tool to assess volume status in cardiac surgery14. However, positive pressure ventilation promotes cyclical changes in stroke volume (SV), and is coupled with arterial pulse pressure changes. SV and arterial pulse pressure rise during inspiration. Conversely, SV comes down during expiration. PPV is directly influenced by the SV and is mathematically expressed as the percentage of the variation between systolic and diastolic pulse pressure obtained in a single ventilatory cycle. Patients with low PPV are insensitive to cyclic changes in preload induced by mechanical ventilation, and they operate on the flat portion of the Frank-Starling curve (non-responders). On the other hand, when PPV is high, patients are operating on the steep portion of the Frank-Starling curve and can respond with an increase in SV after fluid infusion (responders).9,13,15,16 However, the method has some limitations, and they need to be accounted for. The magnitude of PPV variations can be influenced not only by the cardiovascular responsivity status but can also be related to spontaneous breathing, arrhythmia, tidal volume above 10 ml/kg or below 8 ml/kg, right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary arterial hypertension, intrinsic or extrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and alterations in arterial wall stiffness such as the one which occurs with vasodilation.9,16,17Pizov et al. (1988) observed that both absolute (hemorrhagic shock) and relative (pharmacologic vasodilation) hypovolemia are related to the amplification of SPV in anesthetized dogs. They observed that, under absolute hypovolemic conditions, SPV is greater when compared with SPV during pharmacological vasodilation.18 More recent publications found that PPV has greater accuracy than SPV at evaluating cardiovascular responsivity in critically ill patients.9,11,12 These data show the relevance of clinical knowledge about the behavior of PPV during vasodilation. Hence, comparing PPV behavior in hypovolemic conditions and under vasodilation may be useful in clinical settings.The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of hypovolemia and pharmacological vasodilation on arterial pressure traces. MATERIALS AND METHODSStudy design and animal preparation This experimental, observational and comparative study was performed at the Experimental Surgical Center. The study was approved by an Institutional Research Consulting Board. Twenty-one New Zealand male rabbits (1.6 kg ± 0.3 kg) were arbitrarily divided into two groups. Animals in Group 1 (n = 5) had induced hemorrhage, and Group 2 (n = 5) had induced pharmacologic hypotension with a SNP infusion. Five rabbits were used in a pilot study, and six rabbits died before the conclusion of the experiment. The animals were fasted for 12 h before the start of the experiment, and free access to water was allowed. The animals received subcutaneous pre-anesthetic medication (ketamine 15 mg/kg, acepromazine 1 mg/kg and dexamethasone 150 mg/kg), the auricular vein was cannulated with a 24-gauge catheter and a 0.9% NaCl solution was started at 5 mL/kg/h. The rabbits were placed in the supine position. General anesthesia was started and maintained with venous ketamine (2 mg/kg) and 1% inhaled halothane with oxygen flow at 2 L/min.After a tracheotomy was performed, an endotracheal tube was inserted midway along the trachea, and controlled mechanical ventilation was started with a neonatal ventilator (Bear BP-200, Bear medical systems, Inc., Riverside, CA, USA). The ventilation settings were: tidal volume of 15 mL/kg, respiratory frequency of 25 rpm, fractional concentration of oxygen (FiO2) at 100% and PEEP of 3 cm H2O, resulting in a peak airway pressure between 10 and 15 cm H2O. The right carotid and internal jugular vein were cannulated with 22-gauge polyethylene catheters to monitor arterial pressure and fluid administration and to induce the controlled hemorrhage. In order to replace any deficits that may have taken place while fasting prior to the experiment, rabbits were infused with 4 mL/kg of 0.9% NaCl. After 30 min of cardiovascular stabilization, the hemorrhagic shock was initiated. The arterial catheter was connected to a pressure transducer (DTX Plus DT-4812NA, Becton & Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) that was linked to a multiparametric monitor (S/5 Light-Solo®, Datex-Ohmeda, Helsinki, Finlândia) to record continuous heart rate (HR) and digital arterial pressure. These parameters were transferred to a personal computer with S/5 Collect® (Datex-Ohmeda, Helsinki, Finlândia) software. Experimental protocolExperimental procedures were performed as follows. Controlled hemorrhagic shock (Group 1): after baseline (T0) data recording (HR, arterial pressure, SPV and PPV), manual blood withdrawal through the central venous catheter was performed with steps of 10% of the estimated volemia (80 mL/kg) at a rate of 5 mL/minute, until 50% of 191CLINICS 2010;65(2):189-94 Vasodilation increases pulse pressure variation, mimicking hypovolemic status in rabbitsWestphal GA et al.the total volume was bled. At each bleeding step (T1-10%, T2-20%, T3-30%, T4-40% and T5-50%), hemodynamic data were digitally recorded again. Pharmacologic hypotension (Group 2): the mean values of mean arterial pressure (MAP) obtained at each of the bleeding steps observed in Group 1 were defined as the target to be reached with SNP infusion. The SNP infusions were started at 0.5 mg/kg/min. Progressive SNP dose increments were performed until the MAP targets were reached. Hemodynamic data were digitally recorded at each induced hypotension step. The pressure waveforms were analyzed off-line on a personal computer. We identified the arterial pressure respiratory variation and the systolic and diastolic pressures (Figure 1). In each respiratory cycle, systolic pressure and pulse pressure during inspiration (Psmax and Ppmax) and expiration (Psmin and Ppmin) were identified. Respiratory changes in SPV and PPV (in %) were calculated using the following formulas10: SPV (%) = 100 x (Psmax - Psmin) / [(Psmax + Psmin) / 2];PPV (%) = 100 x (Ppmax - Ppmin) / [(Ppmax + Ppmin) / 2].After the experiments, all animals were euthanized by intravenous pentobarbital overdose and hypertonic potassium solution.Statistical methodologyFor the statistical analysis, NCSS: Statistical Software 2000 and PASS 2000: Power Analysis & Sample Size were used. The results were expressed as the mean ± standard error of mean (SEM). Data were compared using Student’s t-test for continuous variables. Mixed ANOVA was conducted to analyze repeated measures between group interactions. All tests were two-tailed, and a P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSAll animals were hemodynamically stable at baseline (BL). Animal weight ranged from 1.3 kg to 1.9 kg. The estimated average volemia (80 mL/kg) ranged from 104 mL to 152 mL. The bleeding time at each step ranged from 10 minutes to 15 minutes depending on animal weight. Sequential hemodynamic changes related to the amount of blood volume removed as well as with SNP administration are shown in Figure 2. The SNP doses necessary to reach predefined MAP goals ranged from 22 mg/kg/min to 56 mg/kg/min. Six animals died during the experimental procedures. Mixed ANOVA results indicated a significant effect in MAP at every steps of the experiment, but there were no differences between groups, in a marginal non-significant level (F = 2.662, p = 0.053, partial eta2 = 0.27). Hence, hemorrhage and SNP groups had similar MAP values at each step of the procedure. The same procedure was conducted to analyze HR, PPV and SPV. HR was different between groups (p < 0.001), but PPV (p = 0.71) or SPV (p = 0.31) did not show any differences.Although there are no MAP differences between the groups, this parameter presented earlier decreases during SNP infusion (T1, p < 0.03) compared to the decrease observed in the hemorrhagic shock model (T2, p < 0.03). PPV changed significantly in the two groups at T3 when compared to the BL values (p < 0.05). On the other hand, SPV was significantly reduced at T1 (p < 0.04) in the SNP group, while the reduction became significant at T4 in the hemorrhage group (p < 0.04). HR increased at T3 during SNP administration (p < 0.02). HR remained unchanged during all stages of blood withdrawal (p = 0.12), while significant changes were observed in the SNP group at T2 (p < 0.03).DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we compare the implications of two shock models (hemorrhagic shock and pharmacologic vasodilation) on arterial pressure traces. We observed that PPV was similar during all steps in both shock models. These results show that exclusive vasodilation (relative hypovolemia) can be confused with real hypovolemic states in clinical settings, especially when deliberate hypotension is necessary. Aortic pulse pressure is directly proportional to SV and is reflected in the peripheral pulse pressure. At the same time, respiratory PPV are inversely proportional to SV and cardiac output (CO). This dependence between pulse pressure and SV explains the PPV amplification observed in hypovolemic status.16,17 During pharmacological hypotension, SV usually remains normal or reduced, while Figure 1 - The representative trace shows the arterial pressure fluctuations during mechanical ventilation. The systolic pressure is maximal during inspiration and declines in expiration. Similarly, arterial pulse pressure is maximal during inspiration and minimal during expiration. Ppmax, maximal arterial pulse pressure; Ppmin, minimal arterial pulse pressure; Psmax, maximal arterial systolic pressure; Psmin, minimal arterial systolic pressure. 192CLINICS 2010;65(2):189-94Vasodilation increases pulse pressure variation, mimicking hypovolemic status in rabbitsWestphal GA et al.vascular resistance is low.18,19 Considering the strong relation between PPV and SV, we expected that PPV would be reduced in the SNP group. However, our findings show similar increments of PPV in both the hypovolemic and pharmacological hypotension models. In our model, requiring small animals, the SNP doses necessary to reach predefined MAP goals were greater than those habitually used in humans. The SNP has arterial and venous vasodilatory capacities, the latter being unpredictable as opposed to the arterial capacity, which is reflected by the arterial pressure. Through its venous action, the large SNP dosage could have increased microvascular volume redistribution, decreased the stressed venous volume and thus reduced the effective blood volume, SV and PPV. The significant HR increments observed in the SNP group, probably for CO compensation, reinforce the possibility of an SV drop. However, this is only a hypothesis that should be confirmed with a more appropriate model. On the other hand, there was no increase in HR in the hypovolemic group. Neural strategies underlying autonomic control may vary depending on the rate of blood loss. Hence, the rate of blood loss has an important impact on autonomic regulation during severe hemorrhage. Porter et al. observed that, depending on blood loss rate, HR may vary in the opposite direction. Another factor that may be involved in maintaining the heart rate in the hemorrhage group is the rate of suppression of autonomic nervous system activity triggered by the anesthesia. Kawase et al. observed heart rate lowering during hemorrhage and isoflurane anesthesia.20,21 On the other hand, NPS causes tachycardia, either through vasodilation or NO donation. This feature is important because high SNP doses were used, and the heart rate in the SNP group was significantly higher than the one in the hemorrhage group.Hypotension during SNP administration is produced by simultaneous reductions of preload and afterload.18,19 Hence, the role of arterial compliance during mechanical ventilation must also be considered for this analysis. Ventricular afterload normally drops during mechanical inspiration because of the increased intrathoracic pressure (ITP). The decrease in afterload contributes to an increase in left ventricular SV, which increases systolic arterial pressure and arterial pulse pressure.19,22 SNP reduces afterload and may exacerbate the respiratory fluctuation of left ventricular SV, with a corresponding exaggeration in PPV and SPV.18,19,22 On the other hand, the adrenergic response, frequently present in hypovolemic states, probably partially reduces PPV and SPV in the hemorrhage group by increasing arterial elasticity and/or shifting blood from an unstressed to a stressed volume. This adrenergic effect on PPV and SPV was previously demonstrated with norepinephrine infusion during a hemorrhagic shock model.23 The authors observed that norepinephrine could significantly reduce the value of PPV and SPV and mask a true intravascular volume deficit.23The present study did not detect an SPV statistical difference between vasodilation and hemorrhage. SPV behavior, such as the one that occurred with PPV, was Figure 2 - Hemodynamic variables measured during experiment steps in the hemorrhage and nitroprusside (SNP) groups. Steps T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 correspond to 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% of blood removal from estimated volemic state (hemorrhage group).

By contrast, Pizov et al. demonstrated that, during NPS infusion in a dog model, SPV was not as strongly affected by pharmacologic hypotension as in the hemorrhagic scenario.18 These conflicting results may also be affected by an intense reduction in preload and afterload caused by the excessive SNP dosage used in the present study. Additionally, in the present study, the anesthetic procedure included inhalatory anesthesia with halothane, which could have amplified the vasodilatory properties of SNP.24In the SNP group, the SPV amplification was increased earlier (T1) than in the hemorrhage group (T4), contrasting with the PPV alteration that occurred at the same time in both groups (T3). The systolic and pulse pressure reduction seen during expiration reflects the expiratory reduction of SV. Conversely, systolic and pulse pressure increments observed in the inspiratory phase are proportional to the increases in SV. Besides the SV increments, the inspiratory gain observed in systolic pressure is additionally influenced by the aortic surrounding pressure, unlike PPV, which is basically conditioned by SV variations. Hence, at least a fraction of SPV results from airway pressure (Paw) transmission to the vascular bed. In addition, when ITP is minimal during expiration, aortic compliance increases, arterial systolic pressure drops and SPV increases.16,17,22,25 This expiratory compliance increment may be exaggerated with SNP administration, and expiratory pulse pressure drops deeply, resulting in a major SPV. Hence, the earlier SPV amplification observed in the SNP group may reflect the transmitted airway pressure rather than SV. When PPV is evaluated, systolic and diastolic blood pressures are measured simultaneously at the same inspiratory ITP and at the same expiratory ITP. The variable effect of ITP on aortic transmural pressure is therefore removed, making PPV a more reliable indicator of preload than SPV. However, we have to consider that, under vasoplegic conditions, expiratory pulse pressure is minimal as a result of increased aortic compliance without any augmentation of the surrounding aortic pressure.16,22,25This study allowed us to conclude that PPV amplification is similar in hypovolemia or pharmacologic vasodilation induced by sodium nitroprusside. SPV is influenced sooner by thoracic pressurization in the vasodilation model and may be affected by a stronger transmission of extra mural aortic pressure and reduced arterial compliance. Caution should be exercised before assuming that arterial dynamic evaluation is only a marker of intravascular volume status.REFERENCES1. Vincent JL. Issues in contemporary fluid management.

propagule pressure hypothesis,14686382,Reversal of adverse hemodynamic effects of pneumoperitoneum by pressure equilibration,,-,,"Hypothesis: The creation of positive-pressure pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic operations can lead to adverse hemodynamic changes, mainly decreased cardiac output. We hypothesized that pneumatic compression sleeves worn on the legs during pneumoperitoneum could abolish the pressure gradient between the abdominal cavity and the legs and so eliminate these adverse hemodynamic changes.  Design Prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial with an additional calibration group.  Setting A regional referral center.  Patients Forty-five consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy who developed hemodynamic changes on induction of positive-pressure pneumoperitoneum were randomized to 3 groups.  Interventions Low-pressure, nonsequential pneumatic compression sleeves, wrapped around the legs, were used to equilibrate the pressure gradient in the study group and to gradually exceed it in the calibration group. In the control group, no sleeves were used.  Main Outcome Measures Transesophageal Doppler cardiac output, stroke volume, and systemic vascular resistance were monitored noninvasively.  Results: The creation of positive-pressure pneumoperitoneum caused a significant decrease of cardiac output and stroke volume and increased systemic vascular resistance. In the experimental groups of patients, pressurizing the sleeves to the pneumoperitoneal pressure caused a significant increase of cardiac output (from 4.82 to 6.74 L/min), increased stroke volume, and decreased systemic vascular resistance (P<.001). This was not seen in the control group. Additional gradual pressure increase in the sleeves of the calibration group produced no further improvement. Releasing the pressure abolished the hemodynamic advantages.  Conclusions: Applying pressure on the legs equivalent to the positive-pressure pneumoperitoneum improves hemodynamic performance during pneumoperitoneum by nullifying the pressure gradient that is responsible for the adverse consequences. This might be of major practical value, especially for cardiac patients undergoing prolonged laparoscopic operations",,,,,

Ppc can be estimated from pleural pressure (Ppl) or, when right ventricular (RV) function is normal, from right atria[ pressure (Pra) (Am Heart J 108:603–605,1984). If the pericardium limits LV diastolic filling or RV diastolic compliance changes, then these estimates of Ppc may be inaccurate. We previously showed that nadir Ppao, immediately after abrupt PEEP removal, reflects on-PEEP LV filling pressure (Am J Physiol 249:H770–H776, 1985). We performed this study to determine if (1) the pericardium limits LV filling pressure during PEEP and (2) on-PEEP LV filling pressure can be estimated by on-PEEP Ppao minus Pra or nadir Ppao. We compared these relations when RV performance was normal (control), after induction of acute ventricular failure (AVF) with propranolol, and after subsequent induction of acute lung injury (AVF-OA) with oleic acid in an acute, anesthetized, closed-chest intact canine model (n = 7). PEEP was increased from 0 to 15 cm H2O in 5-cm H2O increments. Nadir Ppao was measured on termination of 15 cm H2O PEEP. Juxtacardiac Ppl and Ppc increased parallel to increasing PEEP in all conditions except at 0 and 5 cm H2O PEEP in two dogs during AVF, when Ppc exceeded Ppl by as much as 4 mm Hg. Pre and Ppc covaried linearly in all conditions and at all levels of PEEP, although Pre was greater than Ppc (by 5.5 + 1.2 mm Hg [x + SE] in control, 7.1 + 2.1 mm Hg in AVF, and 6.6 + 1.5 in AVF-OA; P < .01). As PEEP increased, Ppao increased more than left atrial pressure (Pla) (P < .01). Nadir Ppao reflected the difference between Pla and Ppc during PEEP (P < .01). Error in Pra and Ppao relative to Ppc and Pla, respectively, confounded the estimate of LV filling pressure, such that Ppao-Pra showed no relation to Pla-Ppc at greater than 10 cm H2O PEEP in control or at any level of PEEP in AVF and AVF-OA conditions. We conclude that the pericardium does not usually limit diastolic filling during PEEP. Also, Ppao-Pra may inaccurately estimate LV filling pressure when either RV performance or PEEP changes",,"Article, PeerReviewed",,,

propagule pressure hypothesis,109499052,Pulsatile Flow Patterns in Distensible Tubes,,"E. O. Attinger, H. Sugawara, A. Navarro, A. Anne Ph. D",2016,"• During the last fifty years a number of physical theories have been proposed in an attempt to describe analytically the behavior of pulsatile flow in the mammalian arterial system. In order to make such an approach to a system of nonuniform, viscoelastic vessels containing a non-Newtonian fluid at all possible, it becomes necessary to introduce simplifying assumptions, the judicious selec-tion of which represents one of the most critical points of departure for any analysis and requires considerable insight into bio-logical phenomena. Womersley&apos;s1 theory, al-though similar to those developed earlier by Witzig2 and Lambossy,3 has been the most widely applied because of its refinements and because he provided the tables necessary for a solution of the linearized Navier-Stokes equations with minimal labor. Due mainly to the unavailability of adequate instrumentation for accurate measurement of blood pressure and flow, experimental verifi-cation of these theories and their underlying assumptions has become possible only during recent years. In a careful study,4 comparing experimental data with those predicted by theory, evidence was presented that Womers-ley&apos;s theory underestimates the viscous losses associated with pulsatile blood flow by a factor of three or more. In view of the assumptions underlying the theory, the authors suggested that this discrepancy may be due either to nonlaminar flow characteris-tics or to convective acceleration associate",,text,,,
propagule pressure hypothesis,105990547,Observations on intrapleural pressure and its influence on the relative circulation rate in emphysema,,"B. Kountz, Emmet F. Pearson, Karl F. Koenig",2016,"In considering the relation of circulatory factors to the hemo-respiratory incompetence of emphysema, attention has usually been focused on possible defects in the pulmonary circulation. Less attention has been paid to factors which hinder the return flow of venous blood. Consideration of all the evidence does not seem to justify this emphasis, and the increased intrapleural pressure which has been observed in functional emphysema indicates that the difficulty may arise from changed intrathoracic pressure quite as much as from changes in the lungs themselves. Evidence from experimental data and inferences from a consideration of the pathology of emphysema support the assumption that when there is obstructed expiration the obvious circulatory impairment is due to change in the lesser circulation. Pathologists agree that there is a diminution in the capillary bed in the lungs in emphysema, a fact which has led to the belief that there must be increased resistance to blood flow through the organ. Friedman and Jackson (1) partially obstructed expiration in dogs and found an increase in the carbon dioxide content of the alveolar air and in the blood. They attributed their results to interference of blood flow through the pulmonary capillaries, a condition supposedly resulting because the intrabronchial pressure was greater than the capillary pressure during the expiratory phase. Heinbecker (2) demonstrated that with inflation of the excised lungs of a cat by positive pressure he could decrease the flow of perfused blood. Lichtheim (3) has shown that the pulmonary capillary bed can be greatly diminished by ligation of the pulmonary artery of one lung with no change in the pul-monary blood pressure. Kountz, Alexander and Dowell (4) studied the effect of partial ob-struction of the expiration of dogs over a period of weeks. They found that as the lungs became larger the intrapleural pressure increased and that venous pressure varied directly with the pressure changes in the pleural cavity.

An estimate of pericardial pressure during PEEP would allow assessment of transmural filling pressure.Methods.In eight patients, at the start of cardiac surgery, pericardial and pleural pressures were recorded by balloon transducers placed over the anterolateral left ventricular wall. We also recorded intravascular pressures and left ventricular short-axis area by transesophageal echocardiography.Results.A stepwise increase in PEEP from 0 to 15 cm H2O caused a linear increase in pleural pressure from 0.3 ± 0.6 (mean ± SEM) to 6.1 ± 0.8 mm Hg (p < 0.01). Pericardial pressure increased from 2.3 ± 0.5 to 5.9 ± 0.6 mm Hg (p < 0.01). The correlation between right atrial (Pra) and pericardial pressure (Pperic) was good: Pra= 0.85 × Pperic+ 1.8, r = 0.77. The correlation between changes in right atrial pressure and in pericardial pressure was better: ΔPra= 0.96 × ΔPperic− 0.2, r = 0.97. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure increased with PEEP (p < 0.05), whereas left ventricular area decreased (p < 0.05). However, there was a progressive reduction in transmural pressure, calculated as wedge pressure minus pericardial pressure (p < 0.05), and in transmural pressure, estimated as wedge pressure minus right atrial pressure (p < 0.05). The estimated transmural filling pressure correlated (r = 0.86) with enddiastolic area.Conclusions.The present observations suggest that right atrial pressure may be used to estimate changes in pericardial pressure with PEEP and that pulmonary capillary wedge pressure minus right atrial pressure is a potentially clinically useful approximation of transmural filling pressure",,"Journal, Clinical study",,,American College of Cardiology.

T., Welsh, D., Raeside, D., Johnson, M. K., Peacock, A. J.",2008,"Background: The relationships among systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP), diastolic pulmonary artery pressure (DPAP), and mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) have been found to be constant in humans breathing air, at rest, while supine. It would be important for those studying the pulmonary circulation if this relationship were maintained under other circumstances, such as change in posture, during exercise, or after pharmacologic manipulation. In particular, it would be useful if the relationship were maintained when treating pulmonary hypertension because this would allow different methods of measurement to be compared, such as SPAP from echocardiography and MPAP from right heart catheterization.    Methods: Data were reviewed from both healthy subjects and those with pulmonary hypertension (n = 65) who had a micromanometer-tipped, high-fidelity pulmonary artery catheter inserted for between 6 and 36 h in the Scottish Pulmonary Vascular Unit between 1997 and 2003. The 5-min averages, while the patient was supine at rest, were analyzed by linear regression to compare the response of SPAP and DPAP with MPAP.    Results: There were linear relationships (measured in millimeters of mercury) of SPAP with MPAP (SPAP = 1.50 MPAP + 0.46), and DPAP with MPAP (DPAP = 0.71 MPAP - 0.66). These were maintained with a high degree of accuracy following changes in posture and activity.

The goal of such a system was to reveal vascular mechanisms relevant to pressure ulcer etiology under clinically relevant conditions and in relation to the evaluation of pressure-redistribution support surfaces. This thesis consists of four quantitative, cross-sectional studies measuring blood flow responses before, during, and after pressure exposure of the sacral tissue. Two optical methods – photoplethysmography and laser Doppler flowmetry – were combined in a newly developed system that has the ability to discriminate blood flows at different tissue depths. Studies I and II explored blood flow responses at different depths in 17 individuals. In Study I the blood flow was related to tissue thickness and tissue compression during pressure exposure of ≥ 220 mmHg. In Study II, the sacral tissue was loaded with 37.5 mmHg and 50.0 mmHg, and the variation in blood flow was measured. Studies III and IV included 42 healthy individuals &lt; 65 years, 38 healthy individuals ≥ 65 years, and 35 patients ≥ 65 years. Study III included between-subject comparisons of blood flow and pressure between individuals in the three study groups lying in supine positions on a standard hospital mattress. Study IV added within-subject comparisons while the individual was lying on four different types of mattress. The studies explored the vascular phenomena pressure-induced vasodilation (PIV) and reactive hyperemia (RH). The most common blood flow response to tissue exposure in this thesis was PIV, although a decrease in blood flow (a lack of PIV) was observed in some individuals. The patients tended to have higher interface pressure during pressure exposure than the healthy groups but no differences in blood flow responses were seen. Our results showed that pressure levels that are normally considered to be harmless could have a significant effect on the microcirculation in different tissue structures. Differences in individual blood flow responses in terms of PIV and RH were seen, and a larger proportion of individuals lacked these responses in the deeper tissue structures compared to more superficial tissue structures. This thesis identified PIV and RH that are important vascular mechanisms for pressure ulcer development and revealed for the first time that PIV and RH are present at different depths under clinically relevant conditions. The thesis also identified a population of individuals not previously identified who lack both PIV and RH and seem to be particularly vulnerable to pressure exposure. Further, this thesis has added a new perspective to the microcirculation in pressure ulcer etiology in terms of blood flow regulation and endothelial function that are anchored in clinically relevant studies. Finally, the evaluation of pressureredistribution support surfaces in terms of mean blood flow during and after tissue exposure was shown to be unfeasible, but the assessment of PIV and RH could provide a new possibility for measuring individual physiological responses that are known to be related to pressure ulcer development",,"Doctoral thesis, comprehensive summary, info:eu-repo/semantics/doctoralThesis, text","Pressure ulcer, photoplethysmography, laser Doppler flowmetry, non-invasive, tissue blood flow, reactive hyperemia, pressure-induced vasodilation, interface pressure, risk assessment, Nursing, Omvårdnad, Clinical Medicine, Klinisk medicin",,Linköping

There is a possibility that the next generation of agile aircraft will exceed the level of anti-G protection presently available and the possibility of pharmacological intervention had been considered as an additional means of raising G-tolerance. Arginine vasopressin plays an active role in maintaining blood pressure, particularly in hypovolaemic situations, by its powerful vasoconstrictive action and control of heart output. As a potential G protection agent AVP has the appeal of not appearing to produce hypertension. The human centrifuge has normally been used to investigate problems of acceleration protection, but because of the hostile environment and space restraints, it has been difficult to carry out systematic biochemical investigations and lower body negative pressure has been used to simulate the cardio-vascular stress of G. The level of plasma catecholamines and arginine vasopressin has been measured during different exposure levels to lower body negative pressure and following b blockade with Propranolol combined with lower body negative pressure. No correlation could be established between peripheral circulating plasma levels of catecholamines and arginine vasopressin for any of the experimental conditions. However, dramatic oscillations in plasma noradrenaline levels were seen and a distinct pattern of arginine vasopressin secretion was observed at presyncope. The role of arginine vasopressin during syncope was investigated and small increases in plasma levels of this vasoactive hormone appeared to play a protective role in some subjects. In subsequent experiments, a bolus of arginine vasopressin was injected prior to exposure to lower body negative pressure, but this did not appear to have any effect on tolerance to lower body negative pressure and in some subjects it was positively detrimental",,"Thesis, NonPeerReviewed",,,

If the pericardium limits LV diastolic filling or RV diastolic compliance changes, then these estimates of Ppc may be inaccurate. We previously showed that nadir Ppao, immediately after abrupt PEEP removal, reflects on-PEEP LV filling pressure (Am J Physiol 249:H770-H776, 1985). We performed this study to determine if (1) the pericardium limits LV filling pressure during PEEP and (2) on-PEEP LV filling pressure can be estimated by on-PEEP Ppao minus Pra or nadir Ppao. We compared these relations when RV performance was normal (control), after induction of acute ventricular failure (AVF) with propranolol, and after subsequent induction of acute lung injury (AVF-OA) with oleic acid in an acute, anesthetized, closed-chest intact canine model (n = 7). PEEP was increased from 0 to 15 cm H2O in 5-cm H2O increments. Nadir Ppao was measured on termination of 15 cm H2O PEEP. Juxtacardiac Ppl and Ppc increased parallel to increasing PEEP in all conditions except at 0 and 5 cm H2O PEEP in two dogs during AVF, when Ppc exceeded Ppl by as much as 4 mm Hg. Pre and Ppc covaried linearly in all conditions and at all levels of PEEP, although Pre was greater than Ppc (by 5.5 + 1.2 mm Hg [x + SE] in control, 7.1 + 2.1 mm Hg in AVF, and 6.6 + 1.5 in AVF-OA; P < .01). As PEEP increased, Ppao increased more than left atrial pressure (Pla) (P < .01). Nadir Ppao reflected the difference between Pla and Ppc during PEEP (P < .01). Error in Pra and Ppao relative to Ppc and Pla, respectively, confounded the estimate of LV filling pressure, such that Ppao-Pra showed no relation to Pla-Ppc at greater than 10 cm H2O PEEP in control or at any level of PEEP in AVF and AVF-OA conditions. We conclude that the pericardium does not usually limit diastolic filling during PEEP. Also, Ppao-Pra may inaccurately estimate LV filling pressure when either RV performance or PEEP changes. © 1991",,"Article, PeerReviewed",,,'Elsevier BV'

Features of pulse pressure waveform from radial artery are associated with blood flow properties of central arteries and left ventricular heart function. Since maintenance of stable hemodynamics is one of the main goals of adequate anaesthesia, non-invasive monitoring of pulse waveform parameters may contribute additional information to routine measurement of arterial blood pressure. Continuous non-invasive finger blood pressure recordings performed with Task Force Monitor® (TFM) provide real-time pulse pressure waveforms. In this exploratory study, we estimated propofol induced changes in three pulse waveform parameters during induction of anaesthesia by pharmacokinetic/-dynamic (Pk/Pd) modeling and examined whether Pd parameters fitted with noninvasive measurements were similar to those fitted with invasive measurements from radial artery",,"Abstract, doc-type:Abstract",,,

In seven dogs, pericardial pressure was sequentially increased in stages, from a mean of −4 ± 1 to 10 ± 2 mm Hg while aortic and pulmonary Doppler flow velocities, pleural pressure changes (respiratory effort), blood pressure and cardiac output were measured.The variation in the Doppler-detected peak transaortic velocity (AV) during inspiration (IV) increased linearly from −5 ± 3% at baseline (pericardial pressure −4 mm Hg) to −32 ± 9% at a pericardial pressure of 10 mm Hg [IVAV = −2 (pericardial pressure) − 13.1; r = 0.78, p < 10-6]. The inspiratory variation in the peak transpulmonary velocity increased from 13 ± 3% at baseline to 71 ± 19% at a pericardial pressure of 10 mm Hg. The inspiratory variation in the pulmonary Doppler peak velocity (IVpy) was dependent on both pericardial pressure and degree of respiratory effort [IVPV = 3.8 (pericardial pressure) + 2.6 (respiratory effort) + 10.9; r = 0.88, p < 10−8].Thus, quantitative relations exist between increases in intra-pericardial pressure and increases in inspiratory variation of peak aortic and pulmonary flow velocities. Additionally, pulmonary artery flow velocity is influenced more than aortic velocity by intrathoracic pressure",,Journal,,,American College of Cardiology Foundation. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Copyright © 2005 by the American Physiological SocietyThe relationships between gastric wall motion and intraluminal pressure are believed to be major determinants of flows within and from the stomach. Gastric antral wall motion and intraluminal pressures were monitored in five healthy subjects by concurrent antropyloroduodenal manometry and transabdominal ultrasound for 60 min after subjects drank 500 ml of clear soup. We found that 99% of antral contractions detected by ultrasound were propagated aborally, and 68% of contractions became lumen occlusive at the site of the ultrasound marker. Of the 203 contractions detected by ultrasound, 53% were associated with pressure events in the manometric reference channel; 86% of contractions had corresponding pressure events detectable somewhere in the antrum. Contractions that occluded the lumen were more likely to be associated with a pressure event in the manometric reference channel (P < 0.01) and to be of greater amplitude (P < 0.01) than non-lumen-occlusive contractions. We conclude that heterogeneous pressure event patterns in the antrum occur despite a stereotyped pattern of contraction propagation seen on ultrasound. Lumen occlusion is more likely to be associated with higher peak antral pressure events.K. Hveem, W. M. Sun, G. Hebbard, M. Horowitz, S. Doran, and J.

High fidelity micromanometer tipped catheters are more accurate both at rest and during exercise. They have been used to examine the pattern of pulmonary artery pressure waveforms under various physiological conditions.A new thoracic impedance device has been developed, the Physioflow 1 (©Manatee, France), which has been shown to measure cardiac output (CO) accurately in a variety of respiratory conditions.It is known that PAP varies with changes in posture, sleep and exercise, and may sometimes appear normal at rest in early disease. Resting pressures vary daily. However, pressure and flow is linearly related in physiological ranges and the relationship is relatively constant. Changes in pressure-flow relationships may be missed at rest. It has been shown that response to a given treatment may be missed if measurements are based solely on resting PAP. For this reason the slopes of pressure- flow plots, are more useful than spot measures of pressure and flow. This has not adequately been explored in humans.Aims: To validate the use of the physioflow 1 cardiac output device, for use in subjects with pulmonary hypertension, and to develop a method of combining its data with high fidelity pulmonary artery catheter measurements, to produce pressure flow plots in a clinical context. The use of exercise or dobutamine, will be explored to achieve this, to then examine the effects on pressure-flow plots of the following:1. The inhalation of oxygen or a nitric oxide/oxygen combination2. Changing exercise posture3. The response of different causes of pulmonaiy hypertension to the former two investigations4. The response of pressure-flow curves to oxygen or nitric oxide/oxygen combination on vasodilator responders and non- responders (at rest).Recruitment. Ethics and Methods Ethical approval was granted for all studies. All subjects who attended the Scottish Pulmonary Vascular Unit between April 2001 and August 2003, for invasive investigations, were offered to participate in the pressure- flow and other studies.Whilst the subjects underwent routine right heart catheter investigations, measurement of cardiac output derived from the physioflow-1 cardiac output device was compared against thermodilutional derived cardiac output measurements concurrently measured during rest or during any physiological or pharmacological manoeuvres.Those who agreed to the study had the micromanometer tipped catheter, inserted into their main pulmonary artery, and measurements were taken concurrently with thoracic impedance derived cardiac output measurements, during exercise or a dobutamine infusion under varying experimental conditions.Results: We found that the physioflow 1 device, overestimated the cardiac output, compared to thermodilutional measurements 1.21 (± 1.85) L min""""\ The percentagechange from baseline however was similar between the two methods, and the physioflow 1 gave an overestimation of only 2.08 % (± 12,5), making it reliable in following the trends of changes in cardiac output in individuals.In the reliable production of pressure- flow plots, both studies failed. The straight leg raising exercise studies, had a 20% equipment failure rate, and only achieved statistically linear plots in 45% of studies. The slope and intercepts had wide confidence intervals making them unsuitable for clinical comparisons (the 95% confidence interval < 20% baseline in 27% of studies). The dobutamine studies were unsuccessful, as the PAP seemed to plateau, as cardiac output continued to increase.Pooled data of vasodilator responders and non-responders, demonstrated that when given air or nitric oxide/oxygen, the non-vasodilator responders slope significantly decreased from 10.2 to 6.9 respectively (p < 0.001), but for responders the slope did not significantly change from 8.6 to 8.9, and the 95 % confidence intervals overlapped (8.2- 8.8 versus 8.7-9.2). For individual disease groups, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and noiinal subjects responded in a similar fashion (decrease in the slope of pressure-flow plots) to non-vasodilator responders (p = 0.004 and <0.001 respectively), in response to oxygen and nitric oxide combined, whereas idiopathic pulmonary hypertensive and connective tissue disorder subjects had parallel shifts similar to vasodilator responders (p = 0.237 and 0.09 respectively).Conclusion: The physioflow-1 not been shown to be accurate enough quantatively in general clinical practice in subjects with pulmonary hypertension when compared tothennodilution cardiac output measurements. It does however follow trends fairly accurately and can thus be a useful research tool.In conjunction with the high fidelity ambulatoiy pulmonary catheter, pressure flow plots can be produced with exercise. The quality of these plots in an individual, however, is not enough to be used to compare pressine-flows clinically. The data when pooled however is sufficient enough to discover other findings like the difference in response to vasodilators of so called vasodilator responders and non responders. It would seem that responders have a parallel shift and non-responders alter their pressure-flow gradient.The use of straight leg raising exercise or dobutamine infusions does not lead to linear pressure flow plots of sufficient quality to be used in individuals clinically but pooled results may be a useful research tool.LIST OF CONTENTS PAGE NUMBERSTitle page 1Abstract 2List of contents 6List of figures 15List of tables 21Acknowledgements 25Authors declaration and publications 26List of abbreviations 28Chapter 1: Introduction1.1 A Brief History of the Science of the Pulmonary 30 Vasculature &Pulmonary Hypertension1.2 Clinical Pulmonary Hypertension 341.2.1 Definition & Epidemiology 341.2.2 Pathophysiology 331.2.3 Investigations 381.2.4 Treatment 381.3 Introduction to Haemodynamics 401.3.1 Introduction 401.3.2 Passive Regulation 411.3.3.

Between 138 and 201 AD Galen summarised these ideas. It was thought that blood was formed in the liver and distributed around the body by the venous system, where it was consumed, whilst nourishing the body (Grover, R. F. et al 1983). It was thought that some of the blood flowed through the right side of the heart in order to nourish the lungs. Most of the blood it was thought passed into the left side of the heart via invisible pores. Galen believed that the lungs conveyed air to the left ventricle, where it became “Vital Spirit.” (Fleming, D. 1955; Grover, R. F. et al 1983). ‘SooF produced by the ventricle was then transported back to the lungs and exlialed. This became church doctrine for 1400 years. It took William Harvey, a student of Fadau, during the if^  centuiy, to establish the idea in mainstream science, that blood follows a circuit, both through the systemic and pulmonary systems. (Grover, R. F. et al 1983).Stephen Hales in the 17*^  ^ and early 18^  ^ Centuries performed the first quantitative measures of the systemic circulation, where he measured the carotid pressure and the cardiac output of a goose. He also deduced that pulmonary artery resistance was likely to be less than systemic vascular resistance, due to the corresponding thickness of the vessel walls, and that the blood velocity must be greater through the lungs then the rest of the body. He estimated the capillary cross diameter, and total lung capillary volume (Grover, R. F. et al 1983).In 1870, Fick described the measurement of cardiac output (CO) in animals and estimated that in man it was likely to be 4.6 L/min. The first direct measurements of32pulmonary arterial pressure was performed by Auguste Chauveau and Etienne Jules Marey (Grover, R. F. et al 1983). During the 19^  ^ and early 20^  ^ centuiy, Otto Frank measured the outflow pressures allowing the calculation of pulmonaiy resistance, and Ernest Henry Starling heart-lung preparations allowed the experimental analysis of mechanical and physiological properties of the heart and lung (Fishman, A. P. 2004). In the early part of the 20^  ^Century, Forssmann showed that right heart catheterisation was possible via a peripheral vein. (The experiments were performed on himself) (Fishman, A. P. 2004). This was taken up by Cournand and Richards, at the Bellevue laboratories. It was here moved from the laboratory to the bedside (Fishman, A. P. 2004). In 1953, Hermann Rahn used this catheter with a balloon tip to measure outflow pressure (Fishman, A. P. 2004). In 1970 William Ganz and Harold J. C. Swan introduced a balloon tipped catheter that could be advanced into the pulmonary artery under haemodynamic monitoring (Swan, H. J. et al 1970).The first physiological studies into pulmonary hypertension were preceded by histopathological studies. In 1891, the first case report was published by Ernst von Romberg, calling the disease “pulmonary vascular sclerosis” (Fishman, A. P. 2004). Following this several other case series were published. In 1901, during a lecture Abel Ayerza described a syndrome categorised by pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dilatation (Fishman, A. P. 2004). Until the 1940’s, it was believed that the cause of primary pulmonary hypertension was syphilis, but Oscar Brenner in Birmingham reviewed 100 case reports and autopsy files of patients with pulmonary hypertension and found that through histological examination syphilis was not the cause (Fishman, A. P. 2004).33In 1951, Dresdale and his co-workers discovered that pulmonaiy vasoconstriction was involved in the pathogenesis of primary pulmonary hypertension (Dresdale, D. T. et al 1954). Since then there has interest in the scientific investigation of pulmonary hypertension, but the majority has been in the pathophysiology of the disease.341.2 Clinical Pulmonary Hypertension1.2.1 Definition & EpidemiologyPulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) accompanies nearly all heart and lung disease. Because of the difficulty of making measurements of pulmonary arterial pressure and flow, the morbidity associated with pulmonary hypertension is poorly understood. Pulmonary hypertension is said to exist if the mean pulmonary artery pressure is greater than 25mmHg at rest or 30mmHg with exercise (Rubin, L. J. 1993). A list of causes of pulmonary hypertension is shown in Table 1.1 (Simonneau, G. et al 2004).1.

MiscellaneousTable 1.1: WHO Classification of pulmonary hypertension35Severity varies between different causes, however the histological changes seen in the vessels are similar and also there also appears to be similarity in responses to treatment, suggesting a common link that leads to vascular changes. Changes are seen in all three layers of the blood vessels, the intima, the media and the adventitia. It is now clear that the factors leading to pulmonary vasoconstriction also leads to remodelling of pulmonaiy vessels, (vasomotor cell growth coupling) (Barer, G. R. et al 1989; Cutaia, M. et al 1990; Peacock, A. J. 1999).The incidence of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension is 1-2 per million per annum (Rich, S. et al 1987). It causes disabling symptoms and left untreated leads to an early death. The incidence of other causes of pulmonary hypertension apart from COPD equal another 1-2 per million per annum (Gaine, S. P. et al 1998; Sanchez, O. et al 1999). The incidence of pulmonary hypertension amongst COPD patients has been calculated to be between 5-40% (Behnka, R. H. et al 1971; Fishman, A. P. 1978; Flint, F. J. 1954; Report of an expert committee 1970). This may give prevalence amongst the general population of 0.3%. In the U.S. it has been estimated that up to 30% of hospital admissions with ‘congestive cardiac failure’ actually have fluid retention secondary to hypoxic lung disease (Flint, F. J. 1954; Report of an expert committee 1970; Weitzenblum, B. et al 1996).1.2.2 PathophysiologyIt is likely that pulmonary hypertension develops as a consequence of a nmnber of genetic and environmental influences (Humbert, M. et al 2004)which ultimately, at the level of the pulmonary arterioles and capillaries, can be divided into 3 pathophysiological facets.36As mentioned earlier, hypoxic vasoconstriction is one of the mechanisms behind pulmonary hypertension. The other two are destruction of the vascular bed and remodelling.Over the past decade, the PPHl gene has been mapped to the locus 2q31-32 (Deng, Z. et al 2000; Lane, K. B. et al 2000; Nichols, W. C. et al 1997).In idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. This gene encodes for bone morphogenetic protein-II (BMPR-2) receptor, Carriers have a 10-20% chance of developing pulmonaryhypertension(Newman, J. H. et al 2001), but the mutation is only found in 26% of sporadic pulmonary arterial hypertension(Thomson, J. R. et al 2000). A further gene the activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)-l has been found to be associated with pulmonary hypertension in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Trembath, R. C. 2001). Bone morphogenetic protein is part of the TGF-p superfamily and may either promote or inhibit cell growth(Loscalzo, J. 2001). Other patients, who do not have the PPHl mutation, may have other abnormalities which interfere with BMPR-2 function. Angiopoietin-1 protein is involved in smooth muscle recruitment and vascular development is overexpressed in patients with pulmonary hypertension and down regulates BMPR2 mRNA. Angiopoietin-1 protein also is correlated with pulmonary vascular resistance (Du, L. et al 2003; Sullivan, C. C. et al 2003). The inability to regulate the proliferative response to injury may be the reason for endothelial cell proliferation foimd in plexiform lesions.In pulmonary hypertensive subjects, there is often found an imbalance in many circulatoiy and tissue coagulation and other factors, and this may lead to in-situ thrombi. These factors include raised thromboxane A2 levels, reduced prostacyclin37levels, reduced nitric oxide synthase and raised endothelin-1 lung tissue levels, elevated serotonin and serotonin transporter levels (Presberg, K. W. et al 2003b).Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction has been known to exist since 1946 (von Euler, U. S. et al 1946) but is not yet fully understood. It will be further discussed in chapter1.3.2.1. Destruction of the pulmonaiy vascular bed is often due to diseases which result in a loss of lung parenchyma but it take up to 50-75% of the vascular bed to be destroyed before the pulmonary artery pressure rises at rest. In addition to short-term autoregulatory changes in vascular tone, vessels can undergo profound fibrocellular changes, in various clinical conditions (Ryland, D. et al 1975; Semmens, M. et al 1974), termed vascular remodelling. Pulmonary vascular remodelling is important clinically because it renders the vessels relatively non-distensible to vasodilators.The process of pulmonaiy vascular remodelling, adventitial changes, medial smooth muscle hypertrophy, distal smooth muscle hypertrophy, intimai proliferation, endothelial cell proliferation, in-situ thrombus and plexiform lesions (Presberg, K. W. et al 2003a).As pulmonary hypertension develops, the thin walled right ventricle of the heart tends to slowly thicken, in response to an increase in afterload. As the right ventricle dilates, this causes a fall in CO as the right ventricle competes for space with the left ventricle in the pericardial sac. This in turn may lead to right ventricular ischaemia and a diop in right ventricle contractility, further reducing the CO (Carlson, E. B. et al 1985; Franciosi, R. A. et al 1968; Gold, F. L. et al 1982; Horan, M. et al 1981; Milnor, W. R. et al 1978).381.2.3 InvestigationsFollowing initial clinical assessment of pulmonary hypertension a multitude of investigations are arranged; however there is no single ideal investigation for diagnosis. The problems with less invasive tests are inaccuracy, and they measure surrogate markers of pulmonaiy hypertension and so cannot be relied apon to make a diagnosis. The most important investigation is right heart catheterisation. Right heart catheterisation is the diagnostic gold standard measuring mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and cardiac output (CO) with the patient at rest and supine while performing a vasodilator challenge test. Even though this test is the gold standard it has its limitations as will be discussed later. There are several vasodilator substances used in this testing, and one of the most useful is nitric oxide (NO) (Pepke-Zaba, J. et al 1991; Ricciardi, M. J. et al 1998; Roberts, J. D., Jr. et al 2000). A positive vasodilator response is defined as a fall of 20% in either mean pulmonary artery pressure or pulmonary vascular resistance (Chemla, D. et al 2002).1.2.4 TreatmentTreatment should be aimed at the underlying cause of pulmonary hypertension. Conventional treatments include oxygen therapy and anticoagulation.In secondary pulmonary hypertension, hypoxia is a precipitating factor. There is evidence that oxygen improves symptoms in children with pulmonaiy arterial hypertension (1985; Kanemoto, N. et al 1989; Krai, H. et al 1993; Nagasaka, Y. et al 1978; Stark, R. D. et al 1973; Weitzenblum, E. et al 1985; Wuertemberger, G. et al 1990).39The other mainstay of treatment is vasodilator therapy. The theory behind the use of vasodilators in pulmonaiy hypertension is based on the importance of vasoconstriction in the development of pulmonaiy hypertension. These can be subdivided into calcium channel blockers and disease directed therapy. Disease Targeted Therapies (DTT) includes prostacyclin, endothelial antagonists and phosphodiestease 5 antagonists. Apart from vasodilatation, these agents may have other beneficial effects in pulmonary hypertension.Calcium channel blockers are used in those deemed to be vasodilator responders (Rich, S. et al 1991; Rich, S. et al 1992), and disease targeted therapy in those who are not. Disease target therapy may double five year survival rates (Rubin, L. J. et al 1990). These beneficial effects may persist up to 10 years (Bush, A. et al 1987; Ewert, R. et al 2000; Galie, N. et al 2002; Hoeper, M. M. et al 2000; Jones, IC. et al 1989; Machhemdl, S. et al 2001; Olschewski, H. et al 2000; Olschewski, H. et al 2002; Oudiz, R. J. et al 2004; Rubin, L. J. 1997; Rubin, L. J. et al 2002; Simonneau, G. et al 2002). Combination therapy of disease targeted therapy may also be useful (Ghofrani, H. A. et al 2003; Hoeper, M. M. et al 2004; Lunze, K. et al 2006).401.3 Introduction to Haemodynamics1.3.1 IntroductionOptimal condition for exchange of mixed venous blood and inspired air is a low pressure high flow system with very little distance separating the air from the blood. The pulmonary circulation is a low pressure system and this prevents fluid from moving out of the vessels into the interstitial space and also allows the right ventricle to operate at a minimal energy cost. The pulmonary circulation operates at approximately 20 % of systemic pressures at rest. This means that the pressure-flow (P-Q) relationship is very sensitive to mechanical influences. The heart and pulmonary vasculature are situated in a pressuie chamber -  the thorax. Pressure measurements have to be interpreted relative to surrounding pressure as breathing effort can generate changes that override nonnal pulmonary vascular pressures.Resistance can be described as the opposing force to a given constant flow. Pulmonary vascular resistance, (PVR), is used to evaluate the forces that oppose right ventricular ejection but can be misleading. PVR is calculated by MPAP- LAPPVR = --------—--------- , and is the ratio of the mean pressure drop across the lung tocardiac output, where Q is blood flow per unit time (or cardiac output, CO, measured in L min^), MPAP is mean pulmonary artery pressure and LAP is left atrial pressure.Pulmonary Artery Occlusion Pressure (PAOP) is the pressure measured when a balloon is inflated within the pulmonary artery and it gives an estimation of LAP under normal circumstances if the tip of the catheter is placed below the level of the left atrium. The41pulmonary circulation is affected by passive and active mechanisms and is altered by varying physiological activity.1.3.2 Passive RegulationThe pulmonary circulation can be affected by lung volume, interstitial pressure or left atrial pressure (LAP). Blood vessels in the lung can be divided into alveolar vessels and extra-alveolar vessels. As lung volume increases (during inspiration), it has different affects on the different groups of pulmonary vessels (Graham, R. et al 1982), The transmural pressures of intra-alveolar vessels and extra-alveolar vessels also depend on changes in alveolar and interstitial pressure produced by changes in lung volume. (Fishman 1985; Naeije 1996)It has been observed in experimental models of pulmonary hypertension with positive extrapolated intercepts of pulmonaiy artery pressure-flow (P-Q) plots, that LAP can be increased up to a certain point above normal without affecting pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). The exact level at which increases in LAP leads to an increased PAP varies from model to model of pulmonary hypertension. This shows that LAP can seldom be taken as the effective outflow pressure to calculate resistance of a hypothetical Poiseuillian flow within the pulmonary circulation (Naeije, R. 1996).1.3.3. Active Regulation1.3.3.1 Hypoxic Pulmonary Vasoconstriction (HPV)Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) was first demonstrated in 1946 (von Euler, U. S. et al 1946). Describing the effects on the pulmonaiy circulation of acute (hours) or chronic (days-weeks) hypoxia is complicated, in view of the great amount of inter &42intra species variability. This can be demonstrated by the variable response of animals to changes in altitude. As altitude increases, the partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere decreases. Some animals, like the cow or cat, show a large increase in pulmonary arterial pressure to decreases in the partial pressure of oxygen, whereas others, like the rabbit or guinea pig show only a little response to decreases in Partial pressure in arterial blood (Pa02). Most animals, including man, fall in the mid category (Reeves, J. T. et al 1979b)Intra species variation also occurs. In adult humans. Reeves and Grover found that there was a large variation in pulmonary artery pressure in those living at high altitude, with a lesser degree of variation or range in those living at sea level (Reeves, J. T. et al 1979a). The variation in the pulmonary artery pressures noted in individuals at high altitude appears to be due to variations in arterial oxygen levels (Grover, R. F. et al 1983).Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is intrinsic to the lung and does not require external neural or humoral stimulation. As the airway oxygen tension reduces below lOOmmHg, the arterial pressure increases, until the response fails (Barer, G. R. et al 1970; Hauge, A. 1968). The onset of vasoconstriction is gradual over minutes, but the offset is rapid (McMurtry, I. F. et al 1976). The response can be affected by other factors, such as cardiac output, left atrial pressure, autonomic nerve stimulation and circulating vasoactive substances (Naeije, R. 1996). The exact biochemical mechanism of HPV is unknown (Fishman, A. P. 1985; Grover, R. F. et al 1983). Giving oxygen may reverse the effects of hypoxic vasoconstriction.431.3.3.2. Nervous Control o f  Pulmonary Vascular ToneThe pulmonary Vasculature has both sympathetic & cholinergic innervation, a- adrenergic receptors produce vasoconstriction and P-adrenergic receptors vasodilation (Grover, Wagner et al. 1983; Fishman 1985). However, an increase or a change in sympathetic stimulation does not lead to HPV. Thus the a- adrenergic effects are either greater than or balanced with the p-adrenergic effects.Studies have shown that in total autonomic block by chemical sympathectomy, pressure-flow plots in dogs move to a higher pressure (Murray, P. A. et al 1986; Naeije, R. et al 1989). This suggests that under certain circumstances the sympathetic system may produce a net vasodilatory response.1.3.3.3 Humoral Control o f the Pulmonary Vascular ToneMany mediators have been proposed to modulate pulmonary vascular tone (Naeije, R. 1996), but only prostacyclin and nitric oxide have been shown to reduce normal vascular tone in experimental models.441.4. Effects of Various Physiological Conditions on the Pulmonary Circulation1.4.1. HyperoxiaPulmonary arteries have been shown to dilate in response to hyperoxia (Madden, J. A. et al 1985; Peake, M. D. et al 1981). During ventilation in the normal lung, the pulmonary vasculature is kept in a relatively relaxed state. Hyperoxia may lead to an acute fall in calculated pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary arterial pressure, but with no significant effect on the systemic circulation or cardiac output (Tucker, A. et al 1975). Hyperoxia selectively decreases the pulmonaiy vasoconstrictive response of prostaglandin p2a (Lonigro, A. J. et al 1975) but does not affect the response to serotonin and noradrenaline (Archer, S. L. et al 1989).1.4.2. PostureWhen a human stands up, the intravascular pressure increases due to the force of gravity, leading to increased transmural pressure and dilation of the venous system. This leads to less venous return and reduced heart filling. Normally 400-500ml is shifted through the leg veins. Although the reservoir of pulmonary blood is decreased, the left heart can still be filled out of this reduced reserve for 10 beats. This is followed by an increased vascular resistance in the skeletal muscle and a reflex tachycardia, augmentation of the contractility of the ventricles, and a catecholamine release. In humans at rest, cardiac output may be up to 25% lower, stroke volume 40% lower and heart rate 30% higher when erect as compared to supine. The distribution of blood in the lungs can be split into 4 zones with regards to the source of pressures that alter flow, and these are partially gravity dependant, (Permutt, S. et al 1962; West, J. B. et al 1964). In the upright position, the blood volume is redistributed to the dependant parts of the body and lung, and thus cardiac return and filling is reduced (Bevegard, S. et al 1960;45Reeves, J. T. et al 1961b). In the lung, the blood distributes, preferentially perfusing the lower segments (Harf, A. et al 1978; West, J. B. 1999).In the supine human lung, the whole lung is perfused (Reeves, J. T. et al 1988a). Pulmonary venous pressure is important for vascular recruitment, thus a higher LAP would allow more recruitment (Permutt, S. et al 1962; Wagner, W. W., Jr. et al 1979). In the erect lung at rest, there is higher pulmonary vascular resistance as there is a smaller lung vascular bed being perfused, and at rest PAP is too low to allow even distribution of blood (West, J. B. 1999). However, even moderate exercise is enough to reverse this and allows the recruitment of upper lobe vessels (Harf, A. et al 1978). An increase in the cardiac output is likely to be the major factor behind this but increasing ventilation may be a contributing factor (Bake, B. et al 1974).1.4.3. ExerciseReeves, Grover and Dempsey extensively reviewed the literature and reanalysed combined data with regards to exercise and the pulmonary circulation in normal humans (Reeves, J. T. et al 1988a). For supine exercise they analysed data on 91 subjects, (28 females), with 196 measurements from several studies (Bevegard, S. et al 1960; Bevegard, S. et al 1963; Bevegard, S. 1963; Dexter, L. et al 1951; Gurtner, H. P. et al 1975; Holmgren, A. et al 1960; Varnauskas, E. 1955). In erect subjects they analysed data on 24 subjects (1 female), with 104 measurements (Bevegard, S. et al 1963; Groves, B. M. et al 1987; Reeves, J. T. et al 1987). In the supine subjects, the workload was up to 1600 kg m min""""\ In mild exercise there was a two to three times increase in oxygen uptake, but there was no change in pulmonary vascular resistance. However46more significant amounts of exercise resulted in a slight decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance (Bevegard, S. A. et al 1963; Holmgren, A. et al 1960). When reviewing the paired data in individuals, there was a ImmHg rise in PAP for every IL rise in cardiac output (Reeves, J. T. et al 1988a). It was assumed that the outflow pressure was pulmonary artery wedge pressure (Pawp), and that the net driving force through the lungs was the difference between PAP and Pawp. Both the regression lines for PAP and Pawp, when paired with Q, had similar intercepts across the y-axis, and thus when the PAP-Pawp vs Q plot was produced, the intercept appeared to got though the origin (Reeves, J. T. et al 1988a). This would suggest that there is only a little change in the pulmonary vascular resistance.In upright subjects, during mild exercise, they found a significant rise in Pawp from 5 ± 3 mmlig, to 9 ±2 mmHg. They also found that PVR also fell significantly, from 1.5 ±0.5 to 0.8 ± 0.3 units. With heavier exercise, they found that PVR was only reduced slightly when compared to mild exercise, with values in these individuals of 2.1 ±0.6 imits at rest, to 0.8 ± 0.2 during mild exercise, and 0.5 ±0.1 units during heavy exercise. They also found that in individuals, the PAP- Q relationship was linear, and the Pawp-Q relationship was linear, but the PAP-Pawp & flow relationship was not. This suggested that when changing from mild to moderate exercise, there is no increase in the pressure gradient, but the calculated PVR decreases (Reeves, J. T. et al 1988a). When the data for resting pressures whilst erect were removed from the linear regression calculations, the line went through the origin, and gave a PVR value of 0.63, which is close to the value of 0.61 obtained for the PVR during exercise at rest. This would suggest that the47main affect of posture is during rest, and even mild exercise takes away the influence of posture (Bevegard, S. A. et al 1960; Reeves, J. T. et al 1961a; Reeves, J. T. et al 1988a).It is felt in general that lung vascular resistance acts passively during exercise, but during prolonged exercise there may be a drop in pulmonary vascular resistance (Bkelund, L. G. 1967).481.5. Pulmonary Vascular ResistanceSince the Swan-Ganz catheter was introduced in 1970, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) has been measured worldwide. The catheter allows measurement of pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure (PAOP), However as it is a fluid filled catheter, it is inaccurate in the measurements of instantaneous pressures, due to inadequate frequency response, motion artefacts, errors in zero levelling and altered signal quality due to regular debubbling and frequent flushing. However, it is assumed that the measurement of mean vascular pressures is reliable. Thermodilutional flow measurements require several cycles (and are not simultaneous), thus this catheter imposes a simplification in which is the pulsatile nature of the pulmonary circulation is ignored.In steady state flow haemodynamics, resistance is calculated as a pressure drop from an upstream point (inflow pressure, Pi„) to a downstream point (outflow pressure, Pom) divided by the flow. In smooth-walled thin, non-distensible tubes, with a laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid, Poiseuille’s law states that: R = (?,„ -  Pout)/Q ” n .r ‘^Where 1 is the length of the tube, p is the coefficient of viscosity, and r is the radius. In most clinical circumstances PAOP gives an estimation of LAP, provided the catheter tip is placed below the level of the left atrium. If pulmonary venous resistance is increased then PAOP is less then pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (PAWP), and PAWP will overestimate LAP. Poiseuille’s law assumes that in the pulmonary circulation (PAP- LAP)/Q plots are both linear and cross the origin. Accordingly the PVR, the slope of (PAP-LAP)/Q is constant.491.6 The Pressiire-Flow Relationship & Limitations of PVR CalculationsThere are several limitations to the use of PVR calculations. Pulmonary vessels are compliant and thus PVR should decrease as MPAP increases (by virtue of the effect of pressure on vessel calibre). Also, the pulmonary vessels may collapse as a result of outside forces at low PAP. These outside forces may include alveolar pressure on capillaries or elastic or muscular recoil of the vessel.These limitations in PVR measurement or the (PAP-LAP)/Q relationship mean that, although the relationship may be linear at a physiological range, it may have a positive intercept (extrapolated) and in some subjects PVR decreases as blood flow increases.Theoretically (PAP-LAP)/Q should not follow Poisseuille’s law as pulmonary blood flow has a branching pattern and is not laminar as it is not a simple Newtonian fluid. However physiological experiments suggest that the relationship is linear with a positive intercept, both in animals and humans (Naeije, R. 1996). This is a constant observation in isolated lung preparations.In well recmited, well oxygenated subjects who are healthy, the plots may intercept the origin. In hypoxia, increased alveolar pressure, vasoconstrictor drugs and a variety of pulmonary and cardiac diseases may shift the curves to a higher slopes and higher intercepts. (Fishman, A. P. 1985; McGregor, M. et al 1985a; Mitzner, W. et al 1989; Naeije, R  1996).501.6.1. Explanation for Higher Intercepts in Pressure Flow PlotsLinear curve shifts towards higher pressures with an increase in pressure intercepts have been explained by the vascular waterfall model (Penmitt, S. et al 1962). According to this model, the pulmonary circulation is made up of parallel collapsible vessels, with different closing pressures. At low flow (and pressure) these vessels are derecruited. At higher flows within the normal physiological range, the P~Q curves are linear, and their extrapolated pressure intercept represents the mean of the individual vascular closing pressures. This mean closing pressure is the effective downstream pressure of the pulmonary circulation. The slope of the linear portion of the P-Q curves reflects the cross-sectional area of the perfused vessels and is interpreted as an incremental resistance upstream from the site of vascular closure.There is however an alternative explanation based on the ‘distensible vesseP model (Zhuang, F. Y. et al 1983). According to this model, the diameter of the pulmonary vessels increase, as their transmural pressure increases. This pressure/diameter ratio flattens progressively until a limiting diameter is attained. The resulting P-Q curves are markedly affected by small changes in compliance. Interestingly a parallel shift of P-Q cui’ves is predicted by the model if both resistance and the compliance increases in small order arterioles (Mitzner, W. et al 1989)1.6.2. Interpretation and Problems with Pressure-Flow plotsInterpretation of pulmonary vascular P-Q curves in intact animals must take into account major methodological difficulties. PAP can be affected at both the highest and lowest flows by changes in the mixed venous PO2, neurohumoral activity and LAP (Fishman, A. P. 1985; McGregor, M. et al 1985a; Mitzner, W. et al 1989; Naeije, R.511996). In addition, very low flows are impossible to study in intact animals. A slight overestimation of PAP at the highest Q leads to an increased slope and decrease the extrapolated pressure intercept of a P-Q plot. This can be avoided by limiting the analysis of data points to comparisons at a given level flow.The ideal way to describe pulmonaiy vascular function is as a P-Q curve generated from as many points as possible. If the analysis is restricted to the effect of a pharmacological intervention at one single point, one may be mislead into believing that the intervention has improved the PVR, as seen in figure 1.1 (ie C to A), but all that has happened is the flow has decreased. Correspondingly, an improvement might be missed by single measurements (figure 1.1 : B to A) but the pharmaceutical agent has decreased the P-Q plot. Thus, the use of a P-Q diagram allows a more reliable identification of changes in pulmonary vascular tone at different cardiac outputs.52PAP-LAPPVRQFigure L I: Pulmonary arterial and flow relationships and the mis~representation o f  resistance changes o f  the pulmonary vasculature from point A, when measuring classical pulmonary vascular resistance changes in respect o f to two possible coordinate values, B & C.The relationship of (PAP-LAP)/Q or PVR is only meaningful if LAP is the relevant downstream or outlet pressure (McGregor, M. et al 1985b; McGregor, M. et al 1985a; Snidennan, A. D. et al 1988). For instance in normal subjects the pressure flow ratio (PVR) decreases as blood flow increases using LAP as the outlet pressure, and this has been assumed to be secondary to flow induced dilatation or recruitment of new parallel vessels. Snidennan et al, (1984, 1988) found in animal studies that the mean pulmonary artery pressure to flow relationship is constant over a large range of flows (Snidennan, A. et al 1984; Snidennan, A. D. et al 1988), but they also found that the pressure flow relationship intercept was always positive. Its minimum intercept represents the critical53closing pressure (the pressure at which blood vessels collapse) (Burton, A. C. 1951; West, J. B. et al 1964), which was usually related to alveolar pressure rather then left atrial pressure. This slope represents resistance, but becomes misleading if LAP is less than the critical closing pressure, because LAP is no longer the appropriate downstream pressure, but critical closing pressure is. The critical closing pressure in normal man is lOmmHg (Brofman, B. H. et al 1957) but in subjects with COPD may as great as 30 ininHg (Channs, Brofman et al. 1958). To date no measurements have been made in pulmonary hypertension.It is known that if a vasodilator is given in pulmonary hypertension, stroke volume will increase, but PAP changes little. Thus the PVR apparently decreases, as calculated from /Q. Figure 1.2 helps demonstrate the possible explanations for a change in PAP and CO to an pharmacological agent, where pressure-flow coordinates change from A to B. From the pressure-flow model there may be one or a combination of both of two alternative explanations.1. It may be that critical closing pressure increases, but real PVR remains constant, (the vessels have the same cross sectional area as normal subjects). If critical closing pressure increases, PAP would be higher for any given level of flow.Also, if critical closing pressure was reduced by vasodilator drug, and real resistance left unchanged, Q would increase without an increase in the apparent driving pressure, leading to an apparent decrease in calculated PVR2. Increases in real PVR (the vessels have a reduced cross sectional area) associated with no change in critical closing pressure (Snidennan, A. D. et al 1988).54PAP- LAPAChange in critical ► closing ▼ pressurePVRIncreasedresistanceFigure 1.2: Possible explanations for change in pressure and flow in an individual subject1.6.3. Pulmonary Vascular Pressure-Flow Relationships: Evidence from animal studies The plots seen in animals vary. Hypoxia increases the slope of pressure-flow plots in both dogs and pigs, but with a greater increase in pigs (Maggiorini, M. et al 1998). Dogs MPAP have variable response to hypoxia (up to 50% non-hypoxia responders) (Lejeune, P. et al 1988). Minipigs & dogs have reduction in P-Q slopes to both hypoxia and hyperoxia when given nitric oxide. The shift of the slope up, to hypoxia, was reversed. Minipigs have a greater reduction in downstream resistance (as calculated by PaOP) (Maggiorini, M. et al 1998). Other chemicals and pharmacaeutical agents, in both normoxia and hypoxia were found to have variable effects on both the gradient and intercept (Lejeune, P. et al 1988).551,6.4. Pulmonaiy Vascular Pressure-Flow Relationships: Human studies1.6.4,1. Normal Values at RestThe haemodynamic values in humans at rest are PAP 13mmHg (8-20), PAOP 9 mmHg (5-14), RAP 5mmHg (2-9). Q 6.5 1 min'^ (4-8.3), Heart rate 69 bpm (40-100) (Naeije, R. 1996).1.6.4.2 Methods o f measuring P-QPressure flovy curves can be produced by several methods. Currently using exercise is the main method in use. In the past, unilateral pulmonary arterial occlusion and extracorporeal circulation were used to produce P-Q curves.Unilateral pulmonary arterial occlusion relies on the assumption that flow is divided equally between the two lungs. If the artery of one lung is obstructed, then all the blood flows through the other lung. From the changes pre and post occlusion the P-Q can be plotted for the obstructed lung. Using this method, the average intercept pressure in normals is -lOmmHg (slightly higher than LAP), and the slope of the P-Q curve is 0.9- 1 mmHg/l/min (Evans, P. et al 1971; McGregor, M. et al 1985a; Reeves, J. T. et al 1988a).Physical exercise can be used for P-Q plots, but as discussed below, it is not ideal. However, so long as LAP, pleural and alveolar pressures are monitored, and excessive changes between different levels of flow are avoided, physical exercise is acceptable. An infusion of dobutamine at lOng/kg/min may be an alternative method of studying passive P-Q relationships (Naeije, R. et al 1994).561.6.4.3. Physical Exercise <& PostureAll increase in cardiac output during exercise does not normally affect pulmonary vascular pressures (Fishman, A. P. 1985; Reeves, J. T. et al 1988a). In healthy supine young adults the P-Q plots during moderate exercise does not exceed 1 mmHg/l/min, corresponding to a PAP of 25mmHg, for a Q of about 20 1/min (Reeves, J. T. et al 1988a) Exercise -induced PAP greater than 30 mmHg is considered diagnostic of pulmonary hypertension.The P-Q plots during exercise may also be influenced by exercise induced changes in pleural pressure, alveolar pressure and left atrial pressure. PAOP increases to 12-15 mmHg during moderate exercise, but during strenuous exercise may increase to as much as 30-35 mmHg (i.e. in triathletes) (Naeije, R et al 1993; Reeves, J. T. et al 1988a). Interestingly these changes in PAOP does not seem to affect the slope of PAP- Q plots during exercise, probably because of vascular distension at high levels of Q and PAOP.P-Q slopes have been reported to decrease when exercise is performed standing or sitting, as opposed to supine. This can be explained by vascular derecuitment at rest (Reeves, J. T. et al 1988a).1.6.4.4. Age & Negative InterceptIn older subjects, exercise is associated with greater increases in PAP and PAOP at lower CO. In patients with cardiac and/or pulmonaiy disease, pulmonaiy hypertension at low levels is explained by early increases in LAP and intrathoracic pressure, and also by mixed venous blood hypoxemia which enhances hypoxic pulmonary57vasoconstriction (Naeije, R. 1996). AU these changes account for the negative extrapolated pressure intercepts for P-Q plots produced by physical exercise in patients with pulmonary vascular disease of various origins (Janicki, J. S. et al 1985; Naeije, R. et al 1994).These changes thus may make exercise not the ideal method to generate multipoint pulmonary vascular P-Q plots, which are only influenced by flow.1.6.4.5. HypoxiaUsing the unilateral pulmonary arterial occlusion method, it has been shown that inspiratoiy hypoxia ( ? %  9-12%) in normal subjects shifts P-Q plots in parallel towards higher pressures (Evans, P. et al 1971; McGregor, M. et al 1985a).1.6.4.6. Pulmonary hypertensionIt has been shown that improvements by treatment with prostacyclin may be missed by PVR alone but detected by P-Q changes (Castelain, V. et al 2002; Janicki, J. S. et al 1985). Depending on the underlying cause of pulmonary hypertension the P-Q relationship have varying slopes or intercepts (Evans, P. et al 1971; Janicki, J. S. et al 1985; Leeman, M. et al 1990; McGregor, M. et al 1985a; Naeije, R. et al 1994).581.7. General HaemodynamicsThe importance of impedance and hydraulic energy in the subject of pulmonary hypertension can be taken from the fact that even when vasodilators reduced PVR, it is the total right ventricular load (which includes a pulsatile component) and not changes inflow or resistance that will influence clinical outcome. Resistance would be more apt with constant flow (using an electrical analogy-D.C. current) whereas impedance is more apt for pulsatile flow (AC current).1.7.1 Pulmonary Vascular ImpedanceIt is possible to measure PAP & Q instantaneously. Pulmonary Vascular Impedance (PVZ) is basically the instantaneous pulmonary artery P/Q changes, separated into separate harmonics. Each hannonic has its own modulis (amplitude) and phase delay. PVZ is calculated after comparing the instantaneous harmonic frequencies of PAP & Q. Pulmonary vascular impedance is the ratio of pressure oscillations to flow oscillations. It is most often measured in the main pulmonaiy artery (‘input impedence’). It is expressed as two components : the ratio of pressure and flow moduli and a phase angle (whether the pressure changes come before or after flow changes, negative indicates flow before pressure wave. Both of these are compared against frequency (multiples of HR) (Milnor, W. R. 1982). Pulmonary vascular impedance at 0 hz (Zo), is equivalent to pulmonary vascular resistance as calculated from PAP/Q.59Figure 1.3: Example of graphical representation of first 6 harmonics of pulmonary vascular impedance in a normal human subject, with pulmonary artery input impedance and phase.normal human, PVZuT 120I 100oM 8060205 6 71 2 3 40frequency harmonicnormal human, PVZ21012frequency harmonicPulmonary vascular impedance at 0 hz (Zo), is equivalent to pulmonary vascular resistance as calculated from PAP/Q.The impedance decreases from this maximum to a minimum at 2-3 hz. Then increase to a smaller secondary maximum at 5-6 hz60At low frequencies, the phase angle is negative and this means that blood flow changes lead pressure flow changes (Naeije, R. 1996).1.7.2. Models of the Pulmonary CirculationVarious attempts have been made to tiy and mimic and explain the observed behaviour of the pulmonary vascular bed, and input impedance including early attempts by Engelberg and Dubois, the Fisimian's transmission line theory and the Pollack's transmission line theory model (Engelberg, J. et al 1959; Pollack, G. H. et al 1968; Weiner, F. et al 1966). These models emphasise the differences compared to the systemic circulation in that; wave reflection is less in the pulmonary circulation and pulse transmission is decreased pulse wave velocity and differences of wave amplification.1.7.3. Wave ReflectionIn the systemic circulation, from the relationship of resistance to the minimum and the subsequent impedance modulii, we can deduce the coefficient of reflection in peripheral arteries. This is approximately 0.8 (ie the wave reflected from peripheral bed has an amplitude of 80% of incident wave) (O'Rourke, M. F. 1971). The point of reflection is equivalent to the point of minimums in frequency. Thus, the distance to point reflection = À./4 = (v/f)/4,where, A.=wavelength, v = wave velocity, f  =harmonic frequency & v=l. (figure 1.4)61f'igure 1.4: Example of single reflected wave, where only when the reflection point is % of the wavelength, or a multiple of a wavelength and a %, will it register at the receiver.receiverwavelengthReflection pointA high frequency suggests a small wavelength. There are multiple waves of same frequency, but at different phases. Different phased waves have the ability to cancel each other out, especially if the wavelength is smaller than distance to receiver (catheter). A wave with wavelengths larger than the distance to the receiver have no opportunity to cancel each other out. Thus the higher the frequency found at the receiver, the smaller the wave’s wavelength, and the more proximal the reflection point of the wave must be, as demonstrated in figure 1.5 (Westerhof, N. et al 1972).62Figure 1.5A <& B: waves produced at two different reflection points. Wave 1 & 2 are in black, and combined wave produced is in red. A. Two high frequency waves, which when combined, cancel each other out B. Low frequency waves, which may be additiveA. High frequency wavesWave 1Wave 24B. Low frequency wavj Receiver pointReflection point 1, Combined wavesRecdverpointWave 2Combined waves2In hypertension, the reflected wave velocity is faster than in normal subjects and thus the modulus and phase curves are shifted to right. This may be secondary to decreased vessel distensibility. Increased in PVR may change PVZ little (O'Rourke 1970) and vice a versa, decreases in PVZ may not be noted by measuring PVR.Systemic central pulse pressure increases if there is an increased resistance and decreased distensibility of the blood vessels (O'Rourke 1970)631.7.4. Aortic pressure waves1.7.4.1. Contour o f  ascending aortic pressure waveHypertension leads to changes in pulmonary impedance, which increases in lower, as compared to higher, pressure harmonics. It also leads to changes in phase. This combination leads to increased amplitude of aortic pressure wave and alteration in its shape.At low pressure there is a simultaneous peak flow and pressure wave. With increasing mean pressure the first peak of pressure wave becomes less prominent (becoming either a hump or change in slope of upstroke. The diastolic wave moves from diastole into late systole and contributes to late systolic pump. The diastolic wave falls in smooth and exponential fashion (O'Rourke 1970)Figure 1.6: Changes in normal aortic pressure wave contour in rabbits subject to alteration in mean pressure~  15010064L 7.4.2. Synthesised aortic pressure wavesNormally diastolic wave is not apparent in the proximal aorta or brachiocephalic arteries. However if there is a reduction in pulse wave velocity, the diastolic wave becomes apparent. This is due to the late return of reflected wave before aortic valve closure compared to normal early return. As the pulse wave velocity increased the diastolic wave becomes less apparent and the amplitude of pressure wave increases in late systole (O'Rourke, M. F. et al 1980).Ejection wave shortening leads to the diastolic wave becoming apparent due to the lower body reflection wave returning after aortic closure. (O'Rourke, M. F. et al 1980). This is found in hypertension, arterial degenerative disease, and aortic coarctation (O'Rourke, M. F. 1970). The mechanism is completely explicable from change in vascular bed and not the pattern of ventricular ejection.In children and animals, pressure wave contour in different systemic arteries can be explained from wave reflection (at upper and lower body) leading to a prominent diastolic wave. As age increases this disappears. It is attributable to a high wave velocity leading to reflected waves from the upper and lower body both fusing together and combining with the initial wave generation, from the ventricle. They become prominent when wave velocity falls or duration of ejection shortens, (ie shock or hypotension).1.7.5. Pulmonary artery wave reflectionThe oscillations in pulmonaiy vascular impedance result from wave reflection in animal studies (Bergel, D. H. et al 1965; Caro, C. G. et al 1961). Pressure wave reflections65originate from the pulmonary microcirculation but also from branch points in the large vessels (Piene, H. et al 1982). The timing of these reflections to the entrance of the pulmonary bed depends on the distance of the reflecting site and also the wave transmission velocity Distance of the reflecting site is much shorter in the pulmonary circulation compared to systemic circulation. The low pressure / high compliance nature of the pulmonary vasculature leads to a slower velocity compared to systemic circulation (O'Rourke, M. 1982; Westerhof, N. et al 1972). The matching of wave transmission velocity and arterial length results in the same pronounced impedance minimum seen in both circulations. Maximum flow amplitude occurs at the same frequencies where impedance is lowest.66Figure 1.7; Graphical example of matched pulmonary and aortic impedance and blood flow harmonics.

This relationship is67adjusted by the phase relationship between pressure and flow, power being proportional to the cosine of this angle (Kuusmaul, Noordergraaf et al. 1992). It is worth noting that the flow patterns at vascular junction are more affected compared to pressure from reflected waves as reflected waves subtract from flow in one direction of the branch and adds to it in the other but reflected waves add to pressure waves in all branches of the junction.In pulmonary hypertension, lower compliance leads to a faster wave reflection velocity, which in turn leads means reflections occur earlier during systole and enhance the systolic pressure load on the right ventricle. This occurs in the systemic circulation but can be reduced by nitroglycerin (Fitchett, D. H. et al 1988). Effects of vasodilators on the pulmonary vascular impedance in hypertension, has not been adequately investigated.Computer models of the pulmonaiy circulation suggest that, if large vessel compliance is unchanged, the usual vasodilator response, (increase flow and decreased ejection time) leads to a small decrease in mean pressure and little change in SPAP, and consequently pulse pressure increases and DPAP decreases. However, if vasodilators result in the opens previously closed vascular channels closed by pathological vasoconstriction they would reduce PVR and diminishes the contribution of reflected waves on the SPAP. Unless pulmonary artery compliance decreases or pulmonary artery resistance declines more than systemic vascular resistance there will not be a decrease in SPAP (Sniderman, A. D. et al 1988).68In summary, pressure generated by the right ventricle is determined by the flow output from the ventricle and the hydraulic arterial load.Figure L8: Venn diagrams o f relative contributions o f elastance, reflections and resistance & critical closing pressures to hydraulic load on the right ventricle in normal humans and pulmonary hypotensionHYDRAULIC ARTERIAL LOAD ON THE RIGHT VENTRICLEELASLRESISTANCEREFLECTI0NSCRITICAL CLOSIING PRESSUREELASTANCERESISTANCECRITICAL CLOSIING PRESSURE[U3FLECTIONSNORMAL CIRCULATION PULMONARY HYPERENSIONIn the pulmonary circulation, elastance (compliance) and wave reflections may become more important to the overall hydraulic load compared to the normal pulmonary circulation. Thus PVR only describes part of the load on the heart.Increasing CO is beneficial to the circulation as an increased SV reaching the systemic circulation will lead to a diuresis, less fatigue and more well being. But increasing CO could result in increase load on the right ventricle and lead to heart failure and death. The reason for the increased load on the right ventricle can be seen when considering the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (Sagawa, K. 1978; Sagawa, K. 1981). If a vasodilator results in an increase in CO, this consequently leads to an effect on the right ventricle. The increased venous return leads to a right ventricular pressure change. If69SPAP & contractility do not change, an increased SV requires increased right ventricular end diastolic (RVED) volume. RVED volume increases result in an increased ejection fraction and increasing diastolic and systolic wall tensions. If RV already generating excessive power, this will be hanuful.If SPAP are reduced, an increase in SV can be achieved by a decrease in RVSD volumes and perhaps RVED volumes leading to reduced systolic and diastolic wall tensions and thus beneficial to the overworked RV.Thus only if pulmonary pressures are reduced can the vasodilator be beneficial to RV performance. This occurs rarely (Rich, S. et al 1983).Calcium blockers can sometimes do this (Rich, S. et al 1985).Figure 1.9: The pulmonary vasodilator effect on pressure volume relationship in the right ventricle, with increased CO.A.

G. et al 1961; Engelberg, J. et al 1959) and dogs (Bergel, D. H. et al 1965; Elkins, R. C. et al 1971; Pace, J. B. 1971; Patel, D. J. et al 1963; Reuben, S. R. et al 1971b), studying impedance and hydraulics in the pulmonary circulation. These had many differences in methodology, but similarity in results.These studies showed that there was an overall similarity of the pulmonary input impedance pattern to that of the ascending aorta. Impedance moduli decreased rapidly from a high level at 0 hz (Zo), to significantly lower levels at higher frequencies.However there are several differences between the pulmonaiy and aortic impedances including an increased distensibility of pulmonary artery (slope of the decline related to pulmonary artery compliance). There are many differences in the pulmonary input impedance spectrum as compared to the systemic circulation which suggest diminished wave reflection in comparison to the systemic circulation. In some subjects, a clear early impedance minimum and secondary rise at twice its frequency point to a relatively discrete and symmetric effective reflection site. This may correspond to the major division of the main pulmonary artery into two branches (Kuusmaul, W. G. et al 1992). In hypoxia, it has been found that the impedance first minimum changes from 3.5 to 5.6, and with serotonin to 6.6 in dogs (Reuben, S. R. et al 1971b). With sympathetic nerve stimulation this moved to 7.5. This indicates a major change in the site of wave reflection, so the site was more proximal. Thus the site of vascular resistance moves more proximal.711.7.8. Hydraulic EnergyOne of the consequences of the pulsatile nature of blood nature of blood flow is that more energy is used to move blood per minute than if the heart somehow generated non-pulsatile flow.The hydraulic energy associated with blood flow of two types, potential energy which is the product of flow and pressure, (Ep = Q.P) and kinetic energy which is calculated as the physical mass of blood and square of its velocity, (Er = 14 m.v^).Both types of energy depend on instantaneous flow and velocities, and are underestimated when calculated from mean pressure, cardiac output or SV. The difference in estimated energy to actual energy can be regarded as a kind of ‘extra’ energy due to pulsations.This pulsatile component nonnally makes up about one third of the total hydraulic power output of right ventricle and one tenth of left ventricular output (but can increase to approxhnately one third of left ventricular output in aortic coarctation) (Milnor, W. R. et al 1969).Right ventricular pulsatile power is affected by a change in heart rate, the compliance of the branches of the large pulmonary arteries and by wave reflection (Milnor 1983). The System is most efficient when flow occurs during low impedance. As proximal portion of vasculature contains most pulse wave energy, it is most efficient to have low impedance here.72In normal humans PAPP is approximately 50% of PAP. Thus the pulsatile arterial power generated by the RV is an important proportion of total external power (30-40%).An important issue is, do vasodilators reduce pulsatile pressure & thus power requirements.An important component of pulsatile hydraulic load is the elasticity of the large and medium size arteries. Normal pulmonary arteries are thinner walled compared their systemic counterparts and the more distensible elastic vessels extend to arteries of 1mm in size (Sniderman, A. D. et al 1988). Consequently the pulsatile load in the pulmonary circulation is less (although a bigger proportion of total) compared to the systemic circulation. As pulmonary hypertension develops the distensibility (or compliance) of the elastic arteries decreases (Reuben, S. R. et al 1971a), partially due to structural changes in the pulmonary circulation, and also in part due to the higher pressures the arteries operating in the steeper portion of their pressure-volume relationship. Thus a larger amount of right ventricular energy must be expended to distend the stiff pulmonary arteries.If vasodilators were able to decrease the PAP, it could be assumed that compliance would increase as the arteries move down their pressure-volume relationship. Were this to occur, we would find a disproportionate fall in the systolic pressure compared to mean pressure.731.7.9. Right Ventricular HaemodynamicsCompared to the systemic circulation, pulmonary circulation is unique in its ability to transport an equivalent amount of flow with substantially lower pressures. In addition, the pulsatile nature of ventricular ejection and the homeostatic requirements for an equivalent amount of blood ejected per beat from each ventricle, place unique constraints upon the right ventricle and the opposition to forward flow in the pulmonaiy circulation (Kuusmaul, W. G. et al 1992).There are several differences between normal right and left ventricles. The right ventricle is thin walled, with one third of the muscle is in continuity with the left ventricle. It has a bellow shape and inertial forces dominate the development of intracavity pressure (result in sufficient pressure for ejection).The presence of low pulmonary vascular resistance minimises load on right ventricle by matching output impedance of pump with input impedance of pulmonary vascular system (Milnor, W. R. 1982).1.7.10. Characteristics of the Pulmonary ArteryThe external hydraulic components of opposition to forward flow in the pulmonary circulation must be different its systemic counterpart, in order to produce the same flow at such a reduced pressure. At the steady state, the tenn of opposition (resistive, PVR) to flow must be substantially less than systemic vascular resistance. The vascular distensibility in the pulmonary circulation must be greater than the systemic circulation. The intrapulmonary course of the vasculature has a radial distribution of perivascular74and interstitial pressure. It is subject to gravitational (postural) affects and has a distinct pattern of vascular divisionBut there are also similarities with the systemic circulation. The amount of blood ejected per beat and the size of the proximal vessels are similar in both the systemic and pulmonary vasculature.The differences in the pulmonary circulation lead to certain features. There is increased distensibility and decreased resistance and thus a low PAP. If PAP was equal the systemic pressure then there would be transudation across the alveolar membrane and pulmonary oedema.The proximal portions of the right and left circulation are both within the intrathoracic cavity. But only the pulmonary circulation has the rest of its vasculature in the intrathoracic cavity. This leaves it subject to variations in the intrathoracic pressure.The remarkable pattern of vascular division in the pulmonary circulation leaves a rather short proximal elastic pulmonary artery and a complex pattern of distal brandling and tapering. This has important implications for wave reflections and transmission (Kuusmaul, W. G. et al 1992).1.7.10.1 ComplianceDecreased arterial compliance is unlikely to cause major impairment of large pulmonary and systemic arteries. For instance, aging decreases compliance but does not cause heart disease (Gonza, E. R et al 1974).751.7.10.2. ResistanceIncreased pulmonary vascular resistance leads to impaired right heart function. This causes increased pressure, causes decreased vascular compliance and increased load on the right ventricle This is associated with symptoms and death (Reeves, J. T. et al 1988b).1.7.10.3. Pulmonary artery, resistance, compliance and the right ventricleReduced compliance of pulmonaiy arteries is associated with increased mortality (Gan,C. T. et al 2007). Pulmonaiy vascular resistance increases alone lead to PAP becoming narrow (animal studies). This is not seen in pulmonary hypertensive patients. They have an increase in PAPP as chronic increases in pulmonary vascular resistance leads to increases in the turgidity and the thickness of the walls of large pulmonary arteries. Both lead to decreases in the compliance in large Pulmonary artery (Milnor, W. R. et al 1978). A decrease in compliance affects the right ventricular load in the following way. If the changes that occur with decreased compliance and increased pulmonaiy vascular resistance in animals resemble those of patients, with decreased flow, right ventricular hypertrophy and increased pulmonary arterial pulse pressure then reduced compliance and increased pulmonary vascular resistance lead to a decrease in flow. This implies that low compliance imposed an additional load to the right ventricle.Decreased lung vessel compliance by up to sixteen fold, with an unchanged pulmonary resistance leads to a reduction of blood flow but the reduction in flow is less than that caused by a fourfold increase in pulmonaiy vascular resistance. This leads to an increase in right ventricular systolic pressure. Pulmonaiy arterial diastolic pressure remains low but with an increase in PAPP. Thus decreased compliance of large pulmonary vessels76contributes to loading of the Ventricle & may be responsible for large PAPP in pulmonary hypertension. Even in mild pulmonary hypertension, where there is an absence of gross abnormalities in the right ventricle, the mechanical function of the right ventricle may be affected, leading to dyssynchiony (Lopez-Candales, A. et al 2007).In the systemic circulation, there is an increased in systemic systolic and pulse pressures with increasing population age due to stiffened vessels and hypertension. The pressure wave has an increased amplitude, late peak and absence of norm diastolic wave (O'Rourke, M. F 1985).The degiee of Left ventricular hypertrophy is related to systemic systolic arterial pressure and to arterial pulse velocity, even at a constant systemic diastolic pressure, and thus decreased compliance, independent to left ventricular systolic load (Bothier, B. N. et al 1985).In the isolated heart, reduced pulmonary artery compliance affects the right ventricular pressure, leading to a change shape of the pressure cuiwe.In normal subjects, the pressure contour resembles a square wave (high fidelity catheters). In pulmonary hypertension, the normal right ventricular pressure contour is followed by a secondary pressure rise. This is not seen in pulmonary valvular stenosis, but only when the obstruction to flow is distal (Reeves, J. T. et al 1988b). This suggests that a load that is imposed in late systole leads to a right ventricular response and77increasing pressure. Late pressure rises account for 30-40% of the total systolic pressure.Hori et al (Hori, M. et al 1981) confirmed that a load suddenly imposed during ejection leads to a change in the pressui*e contour within a beat.Imposing impedance on the left ventricle early in systole leads to an early increase in left ventricular pressure, similar to that seen in with that seen in the late introduction of impedance. Thus during a single contraction, the left ventricle can perceive a change in load and respond. No change in power is required if flow decreases and pressure increases.Extrapolating to the pulmonary circulation, we can speculate that a late systolic load is behind the increases in pressure seen in pulmonary hypertension. We can also state that the pressure contour arises from an abnormal circulation, as obstruction at the outlet valve does not lead to a change in contoiu (Reeves, J. T. et al 1988b) and also Decreases in compliance lead to a late load rise (Elzinga, G. et al 1980).Thus, decreased Compliance lead to a late load rise, increased right ventricular pressure and pulmonary hypertension. In vitro flow and pressure contours are similar in normals but dissimilar if there is an increases in pulmonary vascular resistance and decreases in compliance.In animal models flow is maximal during early systole and pressure maximal during late systole. This suggests that a late load leads to impaired output (especially when the load is maximum). Data from isolated heart model resembles humans as measured by echo. In normals, maximal flow is during mid systole. In pulmonary78hypertension, maximal flow is during early systole. Doppler measurements confirm that as pulmonary vascular resistance increases, maximal flow becomes earlier (Kitabatake,A. et al 1983). Thus the pressiue maximum occurs after the flow maximum in pulmonary hypertension and pressure rises as flow falls (later in systole). Increased pulmonary vascular resistance and decreased compliance, lead to a late load, and late systolic augmentation occurs by early return of reflected wave (O'Rourke, M. F 1985).In dogs with congenital pulmonary stenosis and raised right ventricular pressure, in response to occlusive hypereamia, the normal increase in systolic coronary artery blood flow is decreased (and is less than diastole). Total flow is approximately 100% of the normal, but a higher work load is required by the right ventricle due, to increased pulmonaiy vascular resistance, and thus flow not adequate. This leads to right Ventricular ischaemia (Franciosi, R. A. et al 1968; Gold, F. L. et al 1982). At post mortem right venticular infarcts are reported in pulmonary hypertension with nonnal coronary arteries (Carlson, E. B. et al 1985; Horan, M. et al 1981).It is observed -  RV adepts variably to similar severities of pulmonary hypertension as assessed by PAP and PVR. Improved evaluation would come from using pulsatile haemodynamics and would allow a better understanding of right ventriculovascular coupling (Kuusmaul, W. G. et al 1992). The use of pulsatile haemodynamics could also explain the disappointing clinical results of vasodilators selected exclusively on the basis of PVR in patients with pulmonary hypertension (Sniderman, A. D. et al 1988).791.8. Pharmacological Agents1.8.1. Nitric OxideFollowing the identification of nitric oxide (NO) in 1986 as a factor known to be a mediator in the relaxation of blood vessels, there has been an exponential increase in the understanding if its biological role (Murad, F et al 1995; Murad, F. 2006). NO is an unstable radical, with a molecular weight of 30g/mol, and with a low blood-gas partition coefficient.The affinity of haemoglobin for oxygen is 10  ^times less than that for NO (Borland, C. 1991). In the lungs, nitric oxide combines with oxygen and water and leads to methaemoglobin and nitrate entering the systemic circulation. This reactivity with oxygen and methaemoglobin, leads to a short half life and limits the effect of NO on the pulmonary circulation (Carlsen E & Comroe JH Jr 1958). The half life of NO has been estimated at between 0.05 to 1.8 milliseconds (Celermajer, D. S. et al 1994; Stamler, J. S. et al 1994) Because of this NO must be continuously produced.1.8. LI. Physiological EffectsStamler et al (1994) & Celeimajer (1994), demonstrated that there must be a continuous release of NO even at rest in normoxia, as when they infused a NO antagonist into the pulmonary circulation in both adults and infants respectively, they increased pulmonary vascular resistance and decreased pulmonary blood flow velocity. (Fagan, K. A. et al1999). During hypoxia, it is likely that NO production is increased as with the endothelial NOS knockout mice, which develop pulmonary hypertension in hypoxia (Isaacson, T. C. et al 1994; Zhao, L. et al 1993). Experiments have also demonstrated that even in chronic hypoxia, there must be continuous production of NO. When NO is80inhibited under these conditions, there is an increase in basal vascular tone (Ignarro, L. J. et al 1987; Ignarro, L. J. et al 1999; Singh, S. et al 1997).NO inhibits platelet aggregation and is also a potent inhibitor of smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation, and both of which would oppose the development of pulmonary hypertension, by reducing in-situ thrombi and remodelling (Borland, C. 1991).1.8.1.3. ToxicityAt the levels of NO used clinically, less than 80ppm, if used for only a few hours, NO has very few side effects.1.8.1.4. Therapeutic UseCompared to systemic agents, NO has several potential advantages in both the investigation and treatment of pulmonary hypertension. It has few of the systemic side effects (Pepke-Zaba, J. et al 1991) due to its short half life, and it is a potent and selective pulmonaiy vasodilator (Clark, R. H. et al 2000; Clark, R. H. et al 2003; Davidson, D. et al 1998; Joumois, D. et al 1994). As mentioned earlier in this chapter, it is an ideal agent for the vasodilator test required in the assessment of pulmonary hypertension. Its is now routinely used in the treatment of persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborns and has been found to improve the outcome in this condition (Leier, C. V. et al 1983).811.8.2, DobutamineDobutamine was originally developed as a synthetic catecholamine for short term parenteral administration and became clinically available in 1978 (Leier, C. V. et al 1983). It is a powerful ionotrope, with relatively mild chronotropic and vascular effects. The predominant mechanism of action, augmentation of myocardial activity, is mediated thi’ough predominantly betai adrenergic receptor stimulation. However, at standard doses, it also has betaz and alphai agonist activity. The effects of these additional activities are normally balanced, and so have very little effect on the systemic vasculature (Leier, C. V. et al 1979).The plasma concentration of dobutamine seems to be directly related to its haemodynamic effects (Kates, R. E. et al 1978) In clinical practice, dobutamine infusions use are commenced at 2-3 pg kg'  ^ min'^ increments every 10-30 minutes until the desired effects are obtained. Usually at doses gieater than 15 pg kg""""^  min'^ side effects such as headaches, tachycardias, arrythmias, headaches, anxiety, tremors and blood pressure changes may occur. The onset of action of a continuous infusion of dobutamine, usually occurs within 2 minutes, with maximal effects occurring after 10 or more minutes. Due to the short plasma half life of 2.37 ± 0.70 minutes (in cardiac heart failure) means that most of the drug will be metabolised within 10-12 minutes of the infusion being stopped.(Loeb, H. S. et al 1977; Stoner, J. D., Ill et al 1977). Its major metabolites are pharmacologically inactive. Unlike some other clinically used catecholamines, dobutamine does not alter ventricular pressures (Mishra, M. B. et al 1997).82In many cardiology departments, dobutamine is often used as a surrogate to exercise, in order to perform a cardiac stress test. A standard protocol for this, uses 3 minute stages, with incremental doses, and with the range of infusion being given, ranging from 5 to 40pg/kg/min (Mishra, M. B. et al 1997). Mishra et al, (1997) investigated the haemodynamic effects of dobutamine in 69 human subjects being investigated for ischaemic heart disease, and found that in these subjects mean stroke volume rose from 67.5ml pre test, to 82 ml on 20 pg kg'^ miiT  ^ dobutamine and 85ml on 40 pg kg'  ^ m in'\ Only 26% of subjects reached their maximal stroke volume, by using 10 pg kg'^ min'^ of dobutamine (Vatner, S. F. et al 1972; Vatner, S. F. et al 1974). Studies in animals have shown that the prime action of dobutamine is on contractility, with myocardial contractility increasing by 82% in exercise compared with 125% with dobutamine (Cohen, J. L. et al 1993).Another study, comparing dobutamine to exercise, found when using the standard dobutamine stress testing protocol, (with dobutamine used up to doses of 40 pg kg'  ^min'^), that none of the subjects investigated had any fatigue, versus 58% in the exercise group (p<0,001). 29% of patients had arrhythmias in the dobutamine group versus 8% in the cardiac group (p<0.05), the majority were clinically non-significant arrhythmias, like premature beats, but 4% of subjects had a supraventricular tachycardia. Only 4% had non-sustained ventricular tachycardias (Bradford, K. K. et al 2000; Jenkins, I. R. et al 1997; Murali, S. et al 1991; Schneider, A. J. et al 1987).The effects of dobutamine on the pulmonary circulation are more difficult to ascertain. Studies suggest dobutamine reduces PVR. (Ducas, J. et al 1992; Furman, W. R. et al831982; Hyman, A. L, et al 1985; Lejeune, P. et al 1987b; Light, R. B. et al 1988) However, these studies do not take account to flow affects on PVR. Where flow conditions have been controlled, pulmonary vascular resistance, as ascertained from the gradient of the difference of pulmonary arterial inflow and outflow pressure against flow, has been found to either remain static, increase or decrease.(Pagnamenta, A. et al 2003).A study by Pagnamenta et al, of experimentally induced pulmonary hypertension in 10 anaesthetised and ventilated dogs, found that dobutamine up to a concentration of 10 pg kg'  ^ min'^ had no effect the pressure flow gradients produced in these animals (Pagnamenta, A. et al 2003). However, at higher doses, the effect is dependant on the existing tone. If the existing tone is high, dobutamine may reduce the pressure flow plots, and if the basal tone is low, it may increase the pressure flow gradient (Lejeune, P. et al 1987a). Previously, the same team demonstrated that in dogs, dobutamine at 10 pg kg'  ^ min'^ did not affect the pressure flow plots during hypoxia or hyperoxia. 20 pg kg“^ min""""  ^ led to an increase in the difference between pulmonaiy arterial pressure and occlusion pressui’e at the lowest flows in hyperoxia, but in hypoxia decreased it at all levels (Lejeune, P. et al 1987a).841.9. Pulmonary Artery Pressure: Methods of Measurements1.9.1 Swan-Gantz Catheterisation: Brief overviewRight heart catheterisation is the most useful investigation in pulmonary hypertension as it allows the measurements of a number of important variables. The swan-gantz catheter allows the right atrial and ventricular pressures to be measured before it is placed in the pulmonary artery and an indirect measiuement of the left atrial pressure can be made, by obstructing a branch of the pulmonary arteiy using a balloon. The catheter can also be used to measure pulmonary artery pressure and using the thermodilutional method, an indication of cardiac output can be made.1.9.1.2. Measurements & AccuracyUsing a swan ganz catheter allows various measurements to be made but the accuracy of these is variable. As the pressure is measured using a fluid filled catheter, they are limited in accuracy as they are liable to artefacts such as overshooting and over dampening. An accurate estimation of the zero point is also required.1.9.1.3. Disadvantages & ProblemsApart from the risk from an invasive intervention, the measurements can only be made in a supine position and that real life daily haemodynamic changes cannot be determined.1.9.2. Ambulatory Pulmonary Artery Catheter: A Brief Overview Attempts have been made to measure continuous pulmonaiy artery pressures by fluid filled catheters in a partially ambulatory subject (Levy, R. D. et al 1986). Although they managed to get a limited amount of data on ten patients, this method was fraught with85problems. There was a difficulty of localising the zero reference point, there was a requirement for anticoagulation, and there was a need for filtering for data retrieval. In addition Levy et al (1986) (Levy, R. D. et al 1986), found that a change in posture altered the zero reference point by 4 mm and that there were often substandard recordings due to repeated clotting of the catheter tip and dampening of the sine pressure wave. They were also problems with the equipment and a liability to artefacts. They were satisfactoiy in measuring stationary pressure, but have limitations in fidelity when they are used with varying pressure.In order to measure it during daily activities of living and during exercise tests another method of measurement was required. Micro-manometer tipped pressure catheters were ideal. Levy et al (1986), validated these catheters against fluid filled catheters (Levy, R.D. et al 1986). The amplitude response, the method of measuring pressure, was constant over a selected band of frequencies and fell off at frequencies above and below this. If high frequency response was severely limited then the fastest moving components, the upstroke (systolic pressure) may have been underestimated. This was the case with fluid filled catheters which underestimate the systolic pressure by up to 20 % compared with the micromanometer tipped catheter.7.9.2./. Measurements, Accuracy & RiskAs mentioned earlier, the micromanometer tipped catheter has been validated by Levy et al, (1986) as well as Gibbs et al (1989,1992), when compared with fluid filled catheters (Gibbs, J. S. et al 1989; Gibbs, J. S. et al 1992). There are however a number of problems associated with these catheters. One problem with the micromanometer tipped catheters was zero drift. This has been overcome in the newer catheters, by86zeroing it during the in vivo measurements on several occasions and then using a computer program to readjust all the measurements to correct for this (Raeside, D. A. et al 1998; Raeside, D. A. et al 2000; Richards, A. M. et al 1990). In addition, the pressure transducer was placed at the catheter tip, making the tip its own zero reference point.1.9.2.2. Use in Pulmonaiy hypertensionThe micromanometer tipped catheter has been used to measure pulmonary artery pressure while lying flat, sitting, while asleep and during exercise. Raeside et al (1998,2000) and Richards et al (1990), performed several studies using these catheters successfully (Donald, K. W. et al 1953; Fagard, R. et al 1990; Grenvik, A. 1966; Hillis, L. D. et al 1985; Reddy, P. S. et al 1976; Reeves, J. T. et al 1961a; Sekelj, P. et al 1958; Vissher, M. B. et al 1953; Warburton, D. E. et al 1999a).871.10. Measurement of Cardiac OutputThere are various methods of measurement cardiac output. These range from non- invasive methods like Doppler echocardiography, thoracic bio-impedance cardiography, semi invasive techniques like LIDDCO, and PICCO, (both of which have not been validated for exercise) and invasive techniques like thermodilutional cardiac output or Pick method. They have various problems including, accuracy, difficulty of implementation during exercise, reproducibility and risks. There may also be some difficulty in performing them during exercise.1.10.1. InvasiveL I 0.1.1. Gold StandardInvasive techniques, namely the direct Pick and dye-dilutional methods, are still currently the gold standard methods for measuring cardiac output. A number of studies have been performed comparing these two methods, performed in the 1940’s to 60’s, showing that they give reliable and valid detenuinations of cardiac output at rest and submaximal exercise to an accuracy of within 5-10% (Doyle, J. T. et al 1953; Eliasch, H. et al 1920; Friedlich, A. et al 1950; Miller, D. E. et al 1962; Thomasson, B. 1957; Warburton, D. E. et al 1999a). The measurement of cardiac output via the Pick method relies on the measurement of oxygen from an arteiy and on mixed venous blood sampled centrally (pulmonary artery), along with a measure of oxygen consumption, by the body (lungs), during a steady state condition (Warbruton, Haykowsky et al. 1999). This requires a pulmonary artery catheter to be inserted centrally, and then cardiac output, Q is calculated by the Pick equation,CaO 2 — Ev O288This gives an accurate measurement of cardiac output (Kopelman, H et aJ 1951; MacCanon, DM et al 1955; Warburton, D. E. et al 1999a), at rest or submaximal exercise, but becomes a problem in maximal exercise when a steady state of exercise for 2-3 minutes is not achievable. It also requires highly trained personnel to perfonn precisely and meticulously, and without this becomes more inaccurate (Clausen, J. P. et al 1970; Grenvik, A. 1966; Hillis, L. D. et al 1985; Mohammed, M. M. et al 1981; Warburton, D. E. et al 1999a). In addition there may be problems with cardiac catheterisation, including arrhythmias, and perforation of the artery or right ventricle (Ekblom, B. et al 1968; Strand, P. O. et al 1964).L 10.1.2. ThermodilutionalThe thennodilutional technique can be used to measure Q at both rest and exercise. It is based on the same technique as the dye-dilutional test, but replaces the dye with cold saline (or 5% dextrose) injected through a proximal port of a pulmonaiy arteiy catheter. This cools the blood and this blood is measiued at the tip of the catheter by a thermistor. The amount of cooling is inversely proportional to Q (Nishikawa, T. et al 1993).The advantages of thermodilution compared to the dye-dilutional method is that it produces no changes in the indicator baseline, allows numerous measurements to be made and recirculation is of little concern (Nishikawa, T. et al 1993).Its disadvantage is that as heat is used as a marker, a proportion of it may be lost during handling of the syringes and in the catheter before it enters the circulation (Mackenzie, J. D. et al 1986; Russell, A. E. et al 1990). The error due to the temperature of the89injected water not being ice cold is that Q is approximately 2.86% overestimated for every 1°C that the injectate temperature is warmer (Nishikawa, T. et al 1982; Nishikawa, T. et al 1988; Nishikawa, T. et al 1990; Nishikawa, T. et al 1992). For every 13 seconds a glass filled syringe is held in a hand at 36°C, the 10ml of iced water will increase in temperature by 1°C, (Evonuk, E. et al 1961). Further more, physiological variations occur in blood temperature as a result of phasic heat exchange of air in the lungs (Kohanna, F. H. et al 1977; Nishikawa, T. et al 1993). Using iced fluid may also lead to a transient slowing of the heart and alterations in systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures, right atrial pressure, and right ventricular pressure (Cigarroa, R. G. et al 1989; Hillis, L. D. et al 1985; Nishikawa, T. et al 1993; Ohteki, H. et al 1981; Olsson,B. et al 1970; Rahimtoola, S. H. et al 1965; Samet, P. et al 1966a; Samet, P. et al 1966b),. These effects are gieater the cooler the fluid is and the larger the volume (Cigarroa, R. G. et al 1989). In subjects with a low cardiac output, it may overestimate cardiac output due to recirculation of the indicator before analysis is complete (Konishi, T. et al 1992).In patients with valvular heart disease, it has been found that thermo dilution cardiac output is often unreliable (Hamilton, M. A. et al 1989). In tricuspid regurgitation, this may lead to an imderestimate of cardiac output (Hoeper, M. M. et al 1999). Konishi et al (1992) found that a combination of a low cardiac output state and tricuspid regurgitation have opposing errors which may cancel out and lead to a more accurate result (r = 0.98, slope = 0.86). Similar results have been found in other studies (Branthwaite, M. A. et al 1968; Espersen, K. et al 1995; Mackenzie, J. D. et al 1986; Russell, A. E. et al 1990; van, Grondelle A. et al 1983). Hamilton et al (1989) also90reported little difference between Pick measurements and thermodilution measurements in subjects with heart failure and tricuspid regurgitation (r =0.8). Similar findings have been found by others (Hsia, C. C. et al 1995; van, Grondelle A. et al 1983).In patients with pulmonary hypertension, Hoeper et al (1992) found an acceptable agieement between Pick and thermodilutional cardiac output measurements (mean ±95%, +0.01±l.lL/min), but with a large splay of single results of approximately ±l.lL/min (±30%). Similar findings have been found by others (Becklake, M. R. et al 1962; Chapman, C. B. et al 1950; Werko L et al 2006; Zeidifard, E. et al 1976)The accuracy of the thermodilutional technique is debatable, and certainly it is not a gold standard method, but it has found widespread use in clinical practice. Many studies have reported that this measurement may overestimate the value of Q compared to Doppler echocardiography, CO2 rebreathing, and direct Pick methods, during supine or upright rest and light exercise of up to 40% (Warburton, D. E. et al 1999a) and this error may be even greater during vigorous exercise (Clausen, J. P. et al 1970; Espersen, K. et al 1995).1.10.2 Non-In vasiveOther methods of measuring cardiac output include the foreign gas method, indirect Pick method and Doppler echocardiography. The foreign gas method has been found to be less accurate during resting conditions and in subjects with pulmonary conditions (Clausen, J. P. et al 1970; Farhi, L. E. et al 1976).91The results of the indirect Pick method may vary from direct Pick by 0 to 31% at rest (Espersen, K. et al 1995; Gardin, J. M. et al 1984; Shaw, J. G. et al 1985) and 2 to 19% during exercise (Christie, J. et al 1987; Shaw, J. G. et al 1985).Doppler echocardiography has several possible areas in which errors can be introduced resulting in a lot of inter and intra operator variability (Kubicek, W, G. et al 1966), and in studies, Doppler echocardiography has been found to often underestimate Q when compared to other methods of measuring cardiac output, by up to 21% (Sraraek, B. et al 1983) or may overestimate in the supine posture (Bernstein, D. P. 1986).921.11. Thoracic Bio-impedanceIn 1966 Kubicek et al (Kubicek, W. G. et al 1966) described a method of calculating stroke volume, i.e. cardiac output (Q ) , from thoracic impedance signal. However obtaining the results required special electrodes, a specific configuration, vigorous skin cleansing, and measurements of distances between electrodes were required. It was also assumed the thorax was like a cylinder. All these factors may lead to the introduction of errors into the assessment. Later, Sramek et al (1983)(Osypka, M. J. et al 1999) suggested an alternative equation likening the thorax to a truncated cone. This equation has been further modified by Benstein et al (1986) (Osypka, M. J. et al 1999) to improve accuracy. There are now a number of commercially available instruments available for the measurement of bioimpedance, incorporating these equations.One of the more recent devices is the Physioflow® (Manatee Biomechanical, Macheren, Paris). This had further modified the equation to allow ease of use and a more accurate result.1.11.1. Basic Principles & TheoryIn electricity an analogous relationship exists to the biologicalrelationship between cardiac output (q ) , pressure gradient (MAP -  CVP, where MAP is the mean arterial pressure and CVP is central venous pressure) and peripheral vascular resistance (R),93MAP -  CVPwhere Q ~ ----------------- . This is Ohm's law where the flow of a direct current. 1, isRanalogous to Q , is equal to the voltage drop, E, between the two ends of circuit with resistance, R, giving usER = y ,  where R is measured in ohms (Cl).If the current. I, remains constant then any change in resistance, AR, is proportional to any change in voltage AE, i.e.AR « AE, so any voltage drop would be due to a drop in resistance.The resistance of an electrical object is dependent on the size, shape and resistivity of a material. For an alternating current, resistance is known as impedance, Z, and is frequency dependent. We would then obtain the equation.Following the logic for the direct current, we getAZ « AE. I remains constant then any change in resistance, AZg is proportional to any change in voltage AE.The impedance of a simple cylindrical circuit, is equal to the specific resistance of the material, (p), times its length (L), divided by its cross sectional area, (A),z  = P YA94Thus if both L and p remain constant, then Z is inversely proportional to the cross sectional area.If like Kubicek et al(Kubicek, W. G. et al 1966) we assume that the thorax can be modelled like a cylindrical conductor, with length L, and which has embedded, within itself and in parallel with itself, a second smaller cylindrical conductor, the great vessels (Figure 1.10) (Osypka, M. J. et al 1999).Figure J. 10. Cylindrical conductor as a simple model o f  the human thorax. In this model, the great vessels (aorta, pulmonary artery) are considered as a .smaller cylindrical conductor o f cross- .sectional area (Ay), length (L), and specific resistance (ps) o f hlood, and the remaining thoracic volume is characterized by cross-sectional area Aj, length L, and .specific resistance pr (Pb < <  Pr)- ©(Osypka, M. J. et a l 1999)95It is assume that with each beat-to-beat pulsation, the cross sectional area of the great vessels will alter, giving us an area. If ventilation is suspended, then it can be assumed that change in Z, (AZ), with each heartbeat, is caused mainly by changes in the cross sectional area of the great vessels.By using all these assumptions and synthesising them with the theoiy of Ohm’s law, the changes in the cross sectional area of the gieat vessels, in turn must lead to an inverse change in thoracic impedance. The impedance changes are directly proportional to the voltage and can be measured (Osypka, M. J. et al 1999) and varies directly and proportionally in time with changes in the pulmonary and aortic blood volume, (Khan, M. R. et al 1977), giving the following equation.A V ( t ) = P B ~ - A Z ( t )  ”  S V  =  p „ - - U . d Z / d t - T  %where Zo, is the measured non pulsatile baseline impedance. This is the basis for thoracic bioimpedance and directly leads to the Kubicek equation (Osypka, M. J. et al 19991^ where SV is stroke volume in ml, p is the resistivity of blood (1350 cm), L is the measured distance between the neck and thoracic leads, Zo is baseline thoracic impedance (Q) dZ/dt is the, maximum rate of change of impedance during systole (Q/sec) and T is left ventricular ejection time (s).96Thus in practice a constant current is introduced across the chest and the voltage drop measured. This voltage measured is proportional to impedance across the chest The major part of Zo does not change during beat to beat, only a small component due to the air to liquid ratio during breathing (Wang L. et al 1995).In healthy adults Zo has a mean value of 300 (Bernstein, D. P. 1986; Kubicek, W. G. et al 1966; Sramek, B. et al 1983; Sramek, B. B et al 1983). Superimposed on this baseline impedance is change in impedance, AZ, which is due to both changes due to ventilation and due to blood flow, giving the following equation,Z(t) = Z„ + AZ(t)à iExpiration Inspirationmax. Inspiration max. Expiration max InspirationTimeFigure 1.11. Variation of thoracic impedance Z(t) = Zo * [DELTA ]Z(t) with a ventilation cycle and with each heart heat. The electrocardiogram on top is a reference for the impedance changes related to the cardiac cycle. © (Osypka, M. J. et al 1999)97The overall variations in impedance due to respiration are greater then the variation in impedance due to blood flow (Figure 1.11) (Appel, P. L. et al 1986; Goldstein, D. S. et al 1986).If ventilation is suppressed or corrected for, only the cardiac component of thoracic impedance is left. This is usual about 0.1 to 0.2 O, (about 0.3% to 0.5% of total thoracic impedance). It was found in a theoretical model developed by Wang and Patterson (1995) (Gotshall, R. W. et al 1989), that blood vessel structural changes only contributed 4% to thoracic impedance.1.11.2. Non-physioflow bio-impedance devicesBoth the Kubicek, and the Sramek & Bernstein (Yakimets, J. et al 1995) methods of analysing bio-impedance derived cardiac output relies on sitting a set of two electrodes on the neck and two on the lower thorax, to inject and sense current, and four electrodes to sense an ECG.These equations have been tested against each other and against invasive measurements on many occasions. In some diseases both these equations have performed adequately against thermodilutional measurements (Jensen, L. et al 1995).Gotshall et al (1989) (Jensen, L. et al 1995) also compared the equations, using different equipment, against critically ill patients, (with additional thermodilutional measurements) and in normal subjects. They found in critical care patients there was no significant difference between either the equations or the thermodilutional98measurements. However the values in normals where found to be divergent. The Smarek-Bernstein equation was found to have higher values than the Kubriek equation, the latter being more compatible with previously published values of cardiac output in supine normal patients at rest. An extensive review by Jensen et al (1995) (Bernstein, D. P. 1986; Jensen, L. et al 1995; Kubicek, W, G. et al 1966; Penney, B. C. 1986; Sramek, B. B et al 1983), foimd that the Kubricek method when compared to the direct Pick method, had correlation values of between 0.63 -  0.93 and the modified Sramek- Bernstein equation method had correlation values ranging from 0.41 to 0.99 (Charloux, A. et al 2000; Jensen, L. et al 1995), when compared with thermodilutional methods. Analysis of AZ may also be problematic in subjects who are fluid overloaded, as this reduces baseline impedance to 200 or less (Warbuiton, D. E. et al 1999b). This suggests the value obtained for cardiac output may vary depending on the equation used and the equipment as well as the type of subject the measurements are taken on.1.11.3. Physioflow Cardiac Output Monitoring Device: TheoryThe physioflow (Physioflow, Type PF05L1, Manatee, France) bio-impedance cardiac monitoring device was developed after technical improvements occurred in the available hardware (a new generation of analog technology allows the Physio Flow to improve signal filtering and stability and provide better data processing), and the basic equation has been adjusted. The equation has been modified in order to overcome the difficulties in evaluating blood resistivity (p), the distance between recording electrodes (L) and Zo used in the Kubicek and Sramek-Bernstein equations.Previously getting a precise measurement of Zq, the distance between electrodes and a measurement of left ventricular ejections time was needed for measuring cardiac output99by thoracic impedance (Charloux, A. et al 2000; Hsu, A. et al 2006), but the physioflow avoids the need to know these values. The Physioflow equation was developed by the analysis of an extensive database. Impedance cardiography is based on the analysis of signal wavefonn and its variations. The database was collected on patients with a variety of cardiovascular conditions ranging from severe heart failure to hyperthyroidism, and taken at rest and exercise using the physioflow prototype. The haemodynamic status was assessed using echocardiography and angiography.This equation has allowed the discarding of Zo, thorax height, distance between sensing electrodes and blood resistivity in the calculation of SV (Charloux, A. et al 2000).It uses the following formula:Q, = fcxSV ixB SAwhere is cardiac output (1/min)), /c is the heart rate (beats/min); [based on R-Rinterval measurement, determined on ECG first derivative, dECG/dt, (providing a more stable signal)], BSA (m^) is body sinface area, calculated according to Haycocks formula (BSA = 0.24265 x x where BM is body mass in kg and H isheight in cm), and SVi is SV index (SV divided by BSA).An evaluation of SVi is derived from SVicai which can be calculated by the following equation:SVicai = k X [(dZ/dti„ax)/(Z,„ax”Z,„i„)] X W(TFITcai), where W(TFITcai) is the weighted thoracic flow inversion time. The explanation for the production of this equation is100given in Charloux et al (2000) (Charloux, A. et al 2000)SVicai represents the baseline reference. During the data acquisition phase, the variations of the parameters described above are analysed and compared to those obtained during the calibration phase.SVi = SVicai X 3 V C T I  /  C T IcaixT F IT cai /  T F I T  where CTI is dZ/dt, or the contractility indexCharloux et al (Charloux, Lonsdorfer-Wolf et al. 2000) suggested that the physioflow thoracic impedance cardiac output device had several apparent advantages over other methods of non-invasive thoracic impedance cardiac output devices are, which were:1. Multiple electrodes are not needed (only 4 impedance electrodes and two ECG electrodes) to obtain good quality signals2. The SV results may have better reproducibility even under non-optimal conditions (different electrode positions, types or perspiration)3. A greater range of applications (e.g. cyclo -  ergometer)4. No need to measure thorax morphology5. Increased reliability of the whole acquisition procedure by introducing a calibration phase.1.11.4. Physioflow Cardiac Output Monitoring Device: Validation & Reproducibility There have only been a few studies examining the accuracy and reproducibility of the physioflow (Physioflow, Type PF05L1, Manatee, France) device. The reproducibility of the test was performed as part of a thesis submitted to the University Hospital in Angers, France by Dr R Trouve in his thesis (Trouve, R. 1997).101Two tests of reproducibility were performed. The first involved 25 haemodialysis patients, over 3 sessions providing 75 measurements of stroke volume. The results were a reproducibility correlation of, r = 0.98 p < 0.0001.Similar results were obtained during another test of 7 patients, supine at rest, using 3 separate operators and with 3 consecutive measurements being made by each operator. The purpose was to evaluate reproducibility of stroke volume measurements under various measurement conditions and operators. The results were inter and intra-operator reproducibility of r > 0.96, p<0.0001. These results also demonstrated a remarkable reproducibility during cyclo-ergometer exercise, and imder non-optimal measurement conditions (important modifications of electrode positions).Hsu et al (Hsu, A. R. et al 2006) quoted unpublished results from their own laboratories, that in 20 young men (age 27 + 4 years) the coefficient for variation for SV and Q at peak exercise using the Physio Flow during repeat exercise ergometer tests, spaced more than 2 days apart were 3.6% and 3.4% respectively.There have only been three published studies comparing cardiac output results using the physioflow (Physioflow, Type PF05L1, Manatee, France) with invasive methods. Charloux et al (2000) (Charloux, A. et al 2000)evaluated the reliability and accuracy of the Physio Flow, at rest and during a mild constant effort performed in the supine position on 40 patients with either sleep apnoea syndrome or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The cardiac output was compared with results obtained by simultaneous direct Fick cardiac output measurements. Thirty-two patients were able to perform exercise, ranging from 10 to 50 watts. 72 cardiac outputs measurements were102taken at rest and during exercise, and ranged from 4.34 to 14.84 L/min for Physio Flow and from 3.60 to 15.03 L/min for """"direct"""" Fick. Under linear regression analysis, a correlation coefficient of 0.89 (p<0.001) was obtained for resting values and of 0.85 (p<0.001) for exercising values of physioflow versus Fick cardiac output.Comparison of the two techniques with the Bland and Altman method was also performed. At rest, the mean difference (Q Fick -QPF) was 0.07 L/min (95% confidence interval: -0.23, +0.27 L/min), which represents 0.29% of the mean resting cardiac output. The (QFick - QPF) difference did not vary significantly with the mean of (QFick, QPF). The limits of agreement were (-1.18, +1.32 L/min) at rest. Thus, in 95% of paired measurements, the difference between Q Fick and Q PF was within a (- 19%, +19%) interval. During a mild effort, the mean of the (QFick - QPF) difference was 0.26 L/min (2.44% of mean exercising cardiac output) with a (-0.17, +0.69 L/min) 95% confidence interval. The limits of agreement during exercise were -2.16 and +2.68 L/min (-21%, +26% of cardiac output).In the second study, Richard et al. (2001)(Richard, R. et al 2001) performed a study during which a 1-minute step incremental exercise test was performed from rest to maximal peak effort by a group of 12 subjects. Each subject performed two comparable tests while their Q was measured by impedance cardiography using the new device ( Q Impl, QImp2). In a subgroup of seven subjects Q was also determined by the direct Fick method (QFick) during the second test. The mean difference between the values obtained by impedance (i.e. QIm pl-QIm p2) was -0.009 l.min""""  ^ (95% confidence103interval: -4.2 l.min \  4.2 l.min \  and Q ranged from 3.55 l.min'^ to 26.75 l.min""""  ^ (n = 146). When expressed as a percentage, the difference (Qlmpl -Q Imp2) did not vary with increasing cardiac output. The mean difference between the results obtained using direct Fick and the impedance method was not significant at rest (0.07 L-min'\ i.e., 1%) and during steady state exercise [0.26 L-min'\ i.e., 2.78% (95% confidence interval: - 27.44%, 21.78%]. In addition, they also reported that the direct Fick method was highly correlated with the impedance method during steady state exercise (r  ^= 0.79, P < 0.05, N = 40 and during incremental testing (r == 0.94, P < 0.01, N = 50).In a third study, Bougault et al (2006) examined whether the Physio Flow would still be reliable measuring cardiac output at maximal exercise in patients with COPD when compared to the direct Fick method. The difference found between Physioflow and direct Fick measurements were found to be 3.2 L/min ± 2.9 L/min (31 ± 21%) for maximal incremental exercise and 2.5 ± 2.1 L/min (25 ± 20%) for the strenuous intermittent work exercise test measurements, when analysed by the Bland Altman method (Bland, JM. et al 1986a)Mourea et al (2001) presented data at an international meeting which analysed the results of measurements by the thermodilutional method and taken by the physioflow on 107 ITU patient. They found that the results had a linear regression factor of r = 0.88 (p<0,001), with an equation of Q physioflow =0.75 « Q t h e r m  +L33. The Bland Altman analysis found a bias o f-0.014 L/min.1041.11.5. Cardiac Output ConclusionIn essence, the most reliable method for measuring cardiac output in human subjects is the invasive method of Direct Fick cardiac output. The Fick method is more reliable at rest then exercise. It requires a steady state of exercise and is quite invasive and intensive, Thermodilutional cardiac output measurements are less intensive, but under several circmnstances may be inaccurate when compared to the Fick method.Non- invasive tests also have problems. Doppler echocardiography is hard to perform during exercise and the reliability of the Indirect Fick method is questionable.Thoracic Bioimpedance may be an easy alternative non-invasive method of measuring cardiac output at both rest and exercise. It however requires several assumptions to made about the physiology of the thorax. The accuracy and reproducibility of the results obtained seem to depend on the equation and types of device used as well as any other pathological conditions the patient may have, and each impedance device has to be validated under varying physiological and pathological conditions.The physioflow device has been validated under a few pathophysiological conditions. Under sub-maximal exercise it seems to perform well, but in certain patient groups may not be accurate. It has not yet been validated in patients with pulmonary hypertension at either rest or exercise but results in other patient groups suggest that it may be a useful device for the measuring of cardiac output, non-invasively.1051.12. AimsThe work relayed to this thesis was undertaken as a review of the literature found that pulmonary hypertensive subjects have important changes in their pressure- flow relationships when exposed to various pharmacological agents or physiological manoeuvres, which are not demonstrated at rest (as per PVR).Performing exercise may be difficult in patients with respiratory conditions, hence dobutamine is routinely used as a substitute for exercise in order to increase cardiac output in patients with cardiac disease. There have been no investigations as to whether in the diseased pulmonary vasculature, the response of the pulmonary circulation to dobutamine follows a similar pattern to exercise and whether dobutamine could be a reasonable substitute for exercise.The main aim of this thesis was, by using a combination of high fidelity micromanometer tipped catheters to measure pulmonary artery pressures (PAP), and non-invasive cardiac output (CO) derived from impedance plethsmography in subjects with pulmonary hypertension (PHT), to investigate the pulmonaiy circulation.There has been a paucity of infonnation relating to the pulmonaiy circulation under dynamic stress, in humans. This research would demonstrate the importance of investigating the pulmonary circulation under dynamic conditions and also the advantages of simultaneously measuring PAP and CO. It would also open further avenues of research, into whether subjects with different pressure-flow responses had differing prognoses and response to treatments.106This project aimed to:1. Validate the use of the Physioflow 1 for measuring cardiac output in subjects with pulmonary hypertension.2. Examine the viability of the production of pressure-flow plots by this method, for general clinical practice3. Examine if in the subjects studied, whether there was any difference in pressure flow plots with respect to disease type or vasodilatory response4. Examine if with cardiopulmonary exercise testing, we can discover a non-invasive surrogate of pressure-flow plots5. Examine dobutamine as an alternative to exercise for pressure flow plots107Chapter 2Methods1082. METHODS2.1. Ambulatory Pulmonary Artery Pressure Monitoring2.1.1. EquipmentThe catheter was a 7 F micromanometer tipped catheter supplied by Gaeltec Ltd (Dunvegan, Isle of Skye) (Figure 2.1). This catheter is designed for multiple use and was gas sterilised in ethylene oxide. The data was recorded by a portable battery powered recorder, (Type MPR/2, Gaeltec Ltd, Dunvegan, Isle of Skye), (Figure 2.2.), before being downloaded into a Toshiba satellite 21 OCS laptop. Patients were supplied with a diary.Figure 2.1: Gaeltec Pulmonary Artery 7F catheterI #Gaelté^1—t ti - *  %Figure 2.2. Gaeltec MPR2 Portable Battery powered recorder1092.1.2. The SoftwareThe ambulatory pulmonary artery pressure monitoring programme was supplied by Gaeltec Ltd (Dunvegan, Isle of Skye), and required a computer running a DOS and windows 3.1 operating systems2.1.3. Making a Prolonged Pulmonary Artery Pressure RecordingThe portable recording box had new batteries for every recording and catheters was sent to TSSU for ethylene glycol gas sterilisation a minimum of 10 days before the planned date of catheterisation. On the morning of the catheterisation, the patient had a 8G French sheath inserted in the right internal jugular vein in the cardiac pacing room.The computer, catheter and recording box were taken to the catheterisation laboratory. Following completion of the routine right heart catheterisation on the subject, the ambulatory Gaeltec catheter was removed from its sterile packaging, coiled, and placed in sterile saline for a minimum of two minutes. 0.4mls of air was injected into the port using an insulin syringe with the needle removed and end of the catheter was obseiwed under the sterile saline to check that there was no air leakage. The catheter was kept under the saline for a minimum of 2 minutes as the coating absorbed some fluid. The catheter was then connected to the recorder box that was then switched on and the programme started. On the monitor, the set up menu was entered and the legend '^‘calibrate pressure transducers’^ selected.This offered a positive or negative pressure calibration. A ‘negative’ pressure calibration was always be used. Wlien this was selected, the menu required the recorder to be stopped. At this stage the non-sterile rubber tubing, stored with the computer, was110connected to the port on the catheter and via a 3-way tap, to the port on the rear of the recording box. The 3-way tap was opened to air and return pressed. The system was then opened to air before the pressure calibration was continued. Return was then pressured again and 0 mmHg was established. The programme required a negative pressure calibration to be performed in which the 20 ml syringe is connected to the 3- way tap in communication with the recording box and the catheter, and the syringe was gently sucked until the programme read “calibration complete” and the recording box likewise. At this stage the catheter was ready for insertion into the patient.2.1.4. Cardiac Catheterisation using the Ambulatory Gaeltec Catheter This was placed in the usual way in the proximal pulmonary artery. Care was taken not to advance the tip too far into the pulmonary circulation as wedging led to loss of trace as well as to complications. The tip of the ambulatory was placed no further distal than the transverse processes, preferably on the right.Once the catheter was satisfactorily in place it was re-connected to the recording box then on the computer screen the “record” menu was selected and “start new real time recording” option selected. This showed a real time pressure tracing. There was no need to record at this stage. 0.4 mis of air was again injected into the port in the catheter to see if the preset 0 was satisfactory. So long as the value lay between plus or minus 32 the error was suitable to be corrected later.The catheter was now in a satisfactory position making an adequate recording, and the sheath was pulled back over the catheter to its end and left in position. This tended to displace the catheter further into the pulmonary circulation, therefore the catheterI l lposition was screened again before finally being secured with a suture at the point of insertion.2.1.5. Starting a New RecordingThe computer and recording box was required in order to start a new recording. The computer and the recording box were taken to the subject and were connected to the catheter. From the computer programme, “start real time recording” was selected from the “record” menu to check that the catheter continued to record satisfactorily. The recorder battery voltage was checked again at this stage using the selection from the same menu and if this was adequate, a new recording was started. The 4 megabyte RAM card was inserted in slot in the base of the recording box and “ start recorder” selected from the record menu. This cleared the memory card for a new recording and gave the time on the liquid crystal display that the new recording was started. At this point, this recording was being recorded both on the memory card and on the hard disc of the computer.It was possible to view the actual trace at any time during this on screen using the “start new real time” record option in the record display and during the early period of the trace this was done on a number of occasions to check that 0 calibrations are adequate.2.1.6. TroubleshootingWhen 0 calibrations were not accurate i.e. injection of 0.4 mis of air results in the trace reading a figure different from 0, an “in vivo” calibration was performed. To carry this out, under the ‘record’ menu, the recorder was stopped, the balloon on the catheter was inflated and kept inflated with 0.4 mis of air. The “enter terminal mode” selection was112then made from the record menu. At C prompt the instruction PZERO in continuous upper case was entered and return pressed. The programme instructed the user when the new 0 had been inserted into the catheter and at this stage the ambulatoiy PAP programme was re-entered. “Start new real time recording” was selected from the record menu and 0 rechecked viewing the screen trace. If this procedure was successful, the 0 calibration resulted in an adequate trace which records close to the actual 0 line when calibrated.If the tracing was still not satisfactory, the above procedure was repeated (several times if necessary).0 calibration was performed several times at beginning and end of the trace and intermittently throughout the recording.The liquid Crystal display on the recording box indicated the time and the percentage of memory that had been used.2.1.7. Event buttonIf the patient was put through a series of experiments, standing etc., the “event” button on the recording box was pressed at the beginning and end of these manoeuvres.2.1.8. Completing a TraceAt the end of a ambulatory recording from the record menu the """"stop recorder"""" option was selected and this selection confirmed using the mouse as requested by the program. The 4 megabyte RAM card was then removed from the recording box and inserted in the113card reader device which was connected to the computer via the printer port.On the """"record"""" menu the """"read data from PC card slot"""" was then selected and the patient file was transferred from the RAM card to the hard disc of the PC. This was then saved to the hard drive and patient details entered as appropriate. Under """"comments"""", the catheter used was recorded as subsequent problems that could have occurred during recordings, and which may have been specific to individual catheters, could have been identified.At no time during transfer of data from the PC card to the hard disc of the computer was the bottom option on the menu entitled """"Initialise Card in PC slot"""" selected, as this would have wiped the data from the RAM cai'd. This data was backed up on floppy disc.A section of the visible recorded tracing was highlighted on the screen, on the time scale covering a few hours. The program was then told to save the data first as a beat file, then as an average file and then finally the average file was saved as a comma delimited asc text file.Windows 3.1 was started by typing in WIN and using excel the asc text file was imported as a delimited file. The comma delimits were selected when importing the file, and then the file was resaved as an excel file.1142.1.9. Ending the CatheterisationThe ambulatoiy catheter was removed and hand washed in wann soapy water. The balloon was re-checked by it being placed under water again, 0.4 ml of air was injected into the catheter port and the balloon at the end of the catheter was checked for the escape of any air bubbles. The catheter was then be dried and re-connected to the recording box and a """"new real time recording"""" was started luider the Record menu.The end of the catheter was then placed in the grey top pressure chamber, the plastic tubing connected to the end of this chamber and, via a 3-way tap, to the sphygmomanometer. A syringe was then connected to the 3-way tap and a pressure (measured by the sphygmomanometer) was applied to the pressure chamber and hence the catheter. This pressure appeared on screen as a square wave trace with a given value at the side of the screen for the pressure being measured by the catheter. Thus for an applied pressure of 50 mmHg ideally the pressure wave on screen also recorded 50 mm.2.1.10. Analyzing a TraceThe original pressine trace was viewed on screen. This was accomplished by entering the Amb.PAP. program and the """"review""""' option was selected.""""Review"""" menu - """"list load recordings"""", """"list load from Disc C"""" commands were entered in sequence, and the patient trace selected and loaded. At this point the trace required to be corrected for any 0 drift.Using the """"Select page"""" option at the foot of the screen, the cursor was dragged to the beginning of the trace and the time corresponding with that was noted as the start time115of the manoeuvre.At this point, the trace was opened out to 1.03 min per page and using the page up/page down facilities the first of the 0 calibrations was brought onto the screen. The cursor was then placed on the middle of the 0 calibration and the value to the right of the screen was read, the actual measurement which was made at that time. At this stage, if there was any error inherent in the catheters calibration, revealed against the true pressure applied in the pressure chamber with the sphygmomanometer, then this was corrected.2.1.10.1. Y axis changeThe CTRL F9 keys were pressed simultaneously and a window appeared on screen, showing """"Channel normalizing procedure"""". The carriage return was then pressed, and when """"Enter value at cursor"""" appeared, 0 was entered. Return was then pressed and the computer would request, """"Enter the output observed output observed for a thousand unit step"""". The eiror noted against the measured pressure of 50 was calculated for a unit step of 1000 (e.g. a reading of 40 mm against a measured pressure of 50 would require 800 to be entered). Carriage return was then pressed and the """"continue"""" option on the bottom line selected and the channel normalized. The trace was then re-checked at the first and last 0 points to check that these were on the 0 line.1160 mmHgiRaw data A(^usted(zeroe($ dataFigure 2.3: Example o f Zero calibration points, on raw data a n d  after n d in \tm ea tIf this was not the case, then in addition to the correction being inserted, the trace was also required to be levelled. The cursor should once again be placed on the first 0 calibration, and the F9 key pressed. The box on screen indicated that the channel leveling procedure was being used and that the cursor indicated the first point to be included. Carriage return was then pressed and the cursor moved to the next 0 point, F9 was pressed again and so on until the end of the trace. Once the last 0 had been117selected using F9, Shift F9 was pressed and the entire trace was levelled. At this stage the trace had been corrected and levelled and was ready for further analysis.2.1.11. Further AnalysisThe """"analyse"""" option was selected and from the review menu make """"beat by beat"""" file selected. The programme analysed the entire trace beat by beat removing any artefacts. At the end of this procedure the beat file had been created and this was stored on the hard drive using the patient's name followed by the suffix BT.Once the beat-by-beat file had been created, the next option """"Start new average file"""" was selected and the procedure was repeated. The prograimne selected every 16 beats of information and created a new average file. This again was stored on the hard disc with the patient's name and suffix AV. To analyse the trace further the """"use average data file"""" option was selected.2.1.1 LL Creating an ASCII FileThe """"use average data"""" file was selected and the average data appeared on screen. The trace was opened out to, 1.4 minutes per page and using the select page option the cursor dragged to the beginning of the trace. Using the mouse the trace was then marked as close to the beginning as possible. The screen then read that the trace has been marked for analysis and a 2nd point was selected. Using the select page option the cursor was dragged to the end of the file and the 2nd point marked at the end of the trace. Under the """"analyse"""" option Create ASCII file appeared and was selected. The programme created an ASCII file for the entire average trace and this was stored again to the hard drive with the patient's name and suffix ASC.118For statistical analysis the ASCII files were imported into an Excel file, as a delimited file, and comma’s selected as the delimiter.On Excel, The first column was time (1.0= 24hours), 2""""  ^DPAP, 3^  ^MPAP, 4* SPAP,5^ Heart rate, 6^  ^ SaOi, 7^ '^ HR from SaOi monitor, and the 8^ was an ECG and 9^ ^EVENTS.Time was converted to hrs min secs by changing cell format on excel.Each set of data was a 16 sec average. The time was as a decimal fraction of a day but was converted to hours, minutes and seconds by changing the format of the cell to 00 :00:00.2.L I 1.2. BackupThis data was backed up using the Windows 3.1.Windows 3.1 was started by typing in WIN. A back up of the excel, ASCII and the !raw data files was made. The raw data was found in the subdirectories in the |ildirectory PAPECGO |1192.2. Physioflow2.2.1. Physioflow Set-up and UseThe following is a very brief summary of the manual and details from correspondence with the designer of the physioflow 1, with regards to the calibration phase, assessing adequacy of signal acquisition and trouble shooting to improve results.Device: Physio Flow PF-05 Labi, Manatee, FranceSoftware: software version PF-1.05 for Windows 95/98/Me/XP/2000 (32-bits)Laptop: Sony HEP R600P Pentium IV 850MHzFigure 2.4a & h: (a) Physioflow device, connected to computer and leadsFigure 2.4a & b: (b)Device aloneg-WB!0/06 '20 )3120The Physio Flow 1 is a non-invasive cardiac output measurement device that can be used in patients at rest or under exercise.The user manual is available to download form the World Wide Web at http://www.physioflow.com/download/free/enmanlG4.zip.2.2.2. Connections, Device & SubjectThe subject was connected, using pre-gelled ECG electrodes. The ambu Blue sensor SP (Ambu, Copenhagen, Denmark), was an Ag/Al wet gel electrode, ideal for medium term stress testing.The electrodes were placed on the thorax in the shown figure 2.5. Two electrodes are used to monitor ECG in order to measure the heart rate. Four electrodes were used to monitor the impedance signal.WHITEBLUEREDGREENBLACK(neutral)ORANGEFigure 2.5: Electrode positions for Physioflow 1 device121The exact position of the impedance electrodes was not supposed to be critical provided that one pair is on neck base, and one on thorax base. Adjustments, as mentioned later, were often found to be useful.During bicycle exercise, VI ECG electrode was positioned on the manubrium sterna, the upper impedance electrodes were not placed on the sternocleidomastoid muscle (neck basis), and the lower electrodes were not placed over the over abdominal muscle. Cable wires were fixed on patient’s skin with adhesive tape.2.2.3. Pre calibration requirementsPre calibration is described in detail in the manual.2.2.4. Calibration PhaseInstructions appeared on the Calibration Wizard screen, which were followed. Calibration was particularly important as reliability and reproducibility depended on it. After the best signal stability possible was achieved, it was performed on 60 cycles (the standard profile is 30 cycles). The subject was requested to remain still and to breath normally. A simultaneous blood pressure reading was taken for basal reference values.122WudidPabcM Boyiuÿ sti. not speaidnjt. ■id biTNtbmy nonualyCMtrM IFigure 2.6: Calibration PhaseECG and impedance metric signals were displayed on the screen from the start of this phase and it was important to ensure that they are reproducible, stable, and without artefacts or interference (figure 2.6).It was also vitally important that the heart rate results were accurate, by reviewing the cycle beat by beat on the dE/dt signal (light blue digits corresponding to heart rate and a dark blue signal waveform). Similarly, it was important that verification that the characteristic points of the dZ/dt (green) signal were correctly detected, represented by the presence of red and yellow squares on the signal, the red at the maximal peak and the yellow a little time after the maximal trough in the waveform. The yellow square in dZ/dt was also checked to ensure that it did not appear at the end of the heart cycle.If signal was satisfactory, then “ Calibration ” was clicked in order to proceed123When calibration was completed (60 heartbeats), systolic and diastolic blood pressure was entered. Once the calibration results were verified, they were accepted and monitoring was started.If the calibration looked wrong (bad quality of signal, aberrant values), calibration was restarted by entering (« Retry »).In order to improve calibration and signal, other adjustments were possible. It was possible to increase the calibration cycle to include a larger number of cycles, by entering the profile menu, and entering calibration window. By using this menu, it was also possible to adjust the acquisition signal from a default of 20 cycles before acquisition of data, to 1 cycle (which was required for the pressure-flow experiments). When necessary, entering the analysis menu and entering the signal setup submenu allowed the increase or decrease of sensitivity of both the analysis of the ECG and the impedance (Z) signals.1242.2.5. Monitoring/Recording PhaseFigure 2.7: An example of the 'Monitoring Screen \ with the current values for heart rate (HR, bpm), stroke volume (SV, ml), cardiac output (CO, L/min) and cardiac index (Cl, UminW), as well as graphical representations of these values on the y  axis against time on the x axis. Also on this monitoring screen is dE dt (differential of the ECG signal versus time) and dZ/'dt (differential of impedance signal versus time)The default monitoring screen (HR = Heart Rate, SV = Stroke Volume, CO Cl = Cardiac Output/Index (cardiac index is cardiac output divided by body surface area), SAP, MAP, DAP (systolic/mean/diastolic arterial blood pressure)) was left for the studies as in figure 2.7.During the monitoring, events were marked by pressing SPACEBAR. A window appeared in which details of commencement or discontinuation of an experimental125protocol were noted. Pressing “enter” validated this event and a vertical line appears on the screen. The recording was completed by clicking on “ End of acquisition ” .The colour squares on the dZ/dt signal (red to yellow) were checked to see if one could draw a curve oriented downwards (during systolic phase), as shown in figures 2.8 a, b & c.Figure 2.8a Figure 2.8bFigure 2.8bFigures 2.8 a, b &c: Examples of acceptable signal for physioflow cardiac output measurements, showing dE/dt (differential of the ECG signal versus time) and dZ/dt (differential of impedance signal versus time).1262.2.7. Poor Signal & Possible solutionsDespite the measures taken, often the acquisition signals were of poor quality. The following are examples, with the solutions used.In figure 2.9a, there was no systolic curve during dZ/dt and the colour squares were not regularly plotted. The possible solutions were to clean and shave the skin again, replace impedance electrodes, and reposition impedance electrodes (on the same horizontal level).Figure 2.9a:Poor quality signal received by physioflow deviceIn figure 2.9b, there was an artefact on dZ/dt curve occurring during QRS. The possible solution to this was to clean and shave the skin again was to replace impedance electrodes, and reposition impedance electrodes (on the same horizontal level).127Figure2.9b: Another example of a poor quality signal received by the physioflow deviceFigure 2.9c demonstrated a trace which had electrical interference with static electricity on the ECG.The solution to this was if possible turn off source of static electricity. In addition, it was important to check that no physioflow wires were crossing other wires (e.g. the micromanometer catheter).In figure 2.9d, the majority of QRS were no properly detected and heart rate was wrong. This problem could often occurs in case of bundle branch block or pacemaker patients (QRS large and of low dynamic, and in this case the solution was to increase ECG sensitivity as previously mentioned. An alternate solution would have been to reverse the ECG leads.128Figure 2.9c: third example ofpoor quality signal from physioflow deviceFigure 2.9d: Final example of poor quality signal1292.2.8. Other tips and signal ways of improving signal quality During the studies, one came across other problems and solutions1. It was found that the use of Q & SP blue sensor electrodes or other short & medium term electrodes, were inadequate for the study. We switched to using long term silver oxide gel electrodes.2. Avoiding pressing down on gel part of electrode during placement3. When the ECG downward peak was HIGH the ECG electrodes were inverted4. When ECG recognised too many points, the threshold was DECREASED, & if too few it was INCREASED.5. The most important points was to review waveform were the red and yellow boxes on the dZ /dt. These should have been in systole ie after QRS ( as shown in figure 7) with the curves of the dZ/dt falling after the red box, before going up to the yellow box.6. To improve signal occasionally electrode placement on the back of the neck was tried (less skin folds).7. Occasionally the electrodes were placed onto the lower rib cage (esp during exercise as less muscle interferance).8. The blood pressure measured during calibration was as accurate as possible, as any error here would have been square rooted for cardiac output, (ie error blood pressure error 5%, cardiac output error will be 10% error (1.05 x 1.05) in cardiac output.9. Entering the analysis menu and entering the signal setup submenu allows the increased or decreased of sensitivity of both the analysis of the ECG and the impedance (Z) signals.13010. We improved initial calibration by calibrating over more cycles, as mentioned previously (60 compared to 30).11. And finally if due to time constraints it was not possible to adjust analysis for reliable analysis (red and yellow box placements), but the dE/dt & dZ/dt signals were reliable, it was possible to run the physioflow simulator as described later and an adjust analysis parameters at a later time.P o i n t  o f  s t a r t  o f s y s t o l e ,  c o r r e s p o n d i n g  t o  d o w n w a r d  i n f l e c t i o n  o f  d E / d t  c u r v e  ( b l u e  l ine)Figure 2.10:Point o f start o f  systole o f  dZ dt signal, corresponding to the maximum point o f  the negative inflection o f dE/dt signalAlso note if right ventricular hyperterophy, this may lead to changes in the Z curve with the systolic wave being smaller then the diastolic wave (figure 2.11)131Small systole high diastoleFigure 2.11: Change in Z curve seen with right ventricular hypertrophy, with small systole and large diastole peaks.2.2.9 Reviewing acquisitionInstructions are as per the manual available on http://www.physioflow.com/download/free/enmanl04.zip.2.2.10. Physioflow Simulator OperationIf the impedance wave analysis had been sub optimal due to difficulties in adjusting the wave form analysis parameters during the experiment the entire recording could have be reanalysed under different settings by using two computers, one playing the recorded information and the other analysing it. However there were two problems with this, the computers would analyse this as a continuing loop and the initial calibration data was not recorded, so calibration had to be performed on the actual previously recorded data and thus making it difficult to ascertain what time periods in the new analysis correspond to the old analysis. This process was not undertaken during this study. Instructions on how to perform this were obtained at the time this additional software was obtained.1322.3. Pressure-Flow ExperimentsThe experiment was explained to the patient. As previously described the APAP catheter was inserted into the right (or left if not possible) pulmonary artery via a main central vein.The ambulatory catheter was attached to the ambulatoiy box and this to the laptop computer. The computer is APAP progiamme was switched to real time mode, in which the pulmonary artery wave fonn can be monitored. Several zero calibration manoeuvres were performed (as described previously). The physioflow electrodes were then attached and the machine underwent a calibration period (as described previously). The machine’s parameters were adjusted to save data for each cardiac cycle and were adjusted in order to optimise the impedance waveformThen several readings of the time on the physioflow computer, the laptop for APAP and the APAP box were taken in order to later match the data from the APAP and physioflow devices.The subject was placed the gas inhalation mouthpiece in their mouth. The gas delivery system was as described in chapter 2.5. The subject was given time to become comfortable with the device, whilst on air. Once comfortable, the experiment began, •with the patient inhaling a gas whilst at rest, either air, Oxygen at 15 l/min or a combination of NO at 40ppm and oxygen at 15 l/min.After 5 minutes of acclimatization, the patient was asked to start raising their legs alternately, at a rate of 1 leg rise per second, and for a total of 3 minutes or until they133tired out. Then prior to the next exercise test, the subject rested whilst inhaling air or oxygen as desired for 3 minutes, before repeating the entire procedure again, until all three sets of gases were given. The order in which the gases were given was selected at random prior to the experiment.The data was then analysed as described in chapter 2.7.SubjectBlood pressure monitorNOxBOxMPR/3 pulmonary artery catheterPhysioflow 1&9Figure 2.12:Pressure~Flow experiments.

Air or oxygen was supplied at the tail end of the system, at 15 L min""""\ Nitric oxide was also supplied here. The mixture of gases was thoroughly mixed when it reaches the middle section, with the 2L reservoir bag. The concentration of NO is sampled here. A further 1.6m downstream, the subject inhaled the mixture. They also exhaled through the system, and the gas escaped through the escape port of the APT 60cni^ relief valve. The valve was set at mid pressure in order to cause some back flow through the system, and mixing of gases at the reservoir bag point.The sampled gas was tested by the NoxBOx II, and after a few minutes of calibration time, the flow of NO was adjusted by the adjustable flow valve, in order to obtain the desired NO concentration (figure 2.14a-c). The Patient inhaled the gases, via a rubber reusable mouthpiece (sterilised by Milton sterilisation solution). This mouthpiece fitted tightly in the mouth, between the teeth and the lips, to form a seciue seal, whilst nasal breathing was prevented by the use of standard nasal prongs. Between the mouth piece and the main delivery system was a standard microbial filter.1372.5 Matching APAP and Physioflow dataDuring an experiment, on at least three occasions the corresponding time points for the APAP machine and the physioflow machines were noted.Using this information of equivalent time points noted down during the experiment, the difference between the times were calculated, and the average of this was then used to allow conversion of APAP times to physioflow times.For instance if 09:33:22 (Hours:minutes:seconds) was the APAP time, and 00:01:02 was the physioflow time, the difference would have been 09:33:22 - 00:01:02 giving 09:32:20. This would then be used to convert all other APAP times to physioflow times (ie APAP = 09:33:38 the equivalent physioflow time would be = 09:33:38- 09:32:20 giving 00:01:18.Then the time periods corresponding to the APAP data was marked on the physioflow data, and the averages from this time period until the next time period were calculated for the physioflow data (as previously mentioned the APAP data time period correspond to the average data over the preceding 16 seconds). For instance data over the time period 00:01:02 to 00:01:18 would be averaged.This data would be then added to the corresponding APAP data and would allow further analysis to be undertaken.1382.6 Study groups, Recruitment and Data gatheringSubjects were recruited from all patients attending the Scottish Pulmonary Vascular Unit, (Western Infirmary, Glasgow, UK), between October 2001 and July 2003, all of which were due to undergo invasive investigations for suspected pulmonary hypertension. Bioimepedance data (n=30, for chapters 3-9) and those with combined bioimpedance data and micromanometer tipped data (n=24, from 2001-2003, for chapters 4-8). Figiues 2.14a & b demonstrate the recruitment pool for the studies, and the other studies patients were being recruited for simultaneously.The inclusion and exclusion criteria were as follows.Inclusion criteria1) Primary or secondary pulmonary hypertension at echocardiography and/or right heart catheterisation2) Listed for right heart catheterisation for purposes other than this study3) Age 18-804) Informed consentExclusion criteria1) Exercise capacity limited by disease other than pulmonary hypertension(e.g. musculoskeletal disorder)2) Prostacyclin infusion via Hickman line.3) Left-sided heart disease including significant aortic or mitral valve disease, cardiomyopathy, left ventricular failure or coronary artery disease limiting exercise tolerance.4) Nursing or pregnant women.139The ‘normal’ patients recruited, were all symptomatic, and initial investigations at referring hospitals were suggestive of pulmonary hypertension but after investigating at the unit, they were found to have no obvious disease pathology.All studies, as well as routine clinical tests were performed over a period of a week, as demonstrated in figure 2.15. Spirometry, CT scanning, echocardiography and 6-minute walk test were all performed by the regular NHS staff. The right heart catheterisation and routine haemodynamic measurements were performed either by Dr R. Syyed, Professor A.J. Peacock or Dr H. Mortimer. The simultaneous thoracic bioimpedance and thennodilutional cardiac output data were noted by either. Dr R. Syyed, Dr H. Mortimer or Sister A. Crozier. The thoracic bioimpedance device setup and the insertion of the ambulatory pulmonary artery catheter were perfonned by Dr R Syyed. The thoracic bioimpedance device was left to run during the routine haemodynamic tests. If Dr Syyed was performing the routine haemodynamic investigations, and the thoracic bio-impedance signal was lost, it was not possible to re-set this device. All other experiments were performed by Dr R. Syyed. All data processing and analysis was performed by Dr R. Syyed.1400> (U°P Q.% % R(TJ *N$ (UÜ0 ™(N n, OJHIt4e11I141*aLU rH(N< m CLgz o o .LU ( -  tH  ÏZ a> <X3T 5(NCL.-a*aCLLDWH <rsiP %O -SLn< .ax:T 3Ln 3 ;r-l ^""""OQ.

The student t-test was used for chapter 3. using SPSS-Vs 14.0, Bland Altman analysis (Bland, JM. et al 1986b) for Chapter 4. Multivariate analysis was performed in chapter 3, but due to heterogeneity and small number of subjects recruited, and the interrelated variables like pressure variables, the analysis may not be statistically robust.For chapters 5-8, the Poon test to combine data was used (Poon, C. S. 1988) and this data was further analysed by general linear regression analysis (SPSS vs 14.0). Linear143regression analysis was used to produce histograms and normality plots, as well as the values and confidence intervals of the slopes and intercepts of the lines obtained. Initial assessment of the probability of the linearity of the plots was done by visually reviewing the scattergrams of the plots and the histogram and normality plots of the residuals. Further assessment of the whether the likelihood of the linearity of the plots of paired data was by the ANOVA test of linearity where possible. A test of the usefulness of the plots was attempted by performing the ANCOVA test, a test of likelihood of parallelism, on the data, comparing air with nitric oxide / oxygen combination, air with oxygen and oxygen with the nitric oxide / oxygen combination.2.8 EthicsEthical approval was provided by the West Ethics committee. North Glasgow NHS University Trust. All subjects gave informed consent for thoracic bioimpedance cardiac output measuiements as part of their clinical evaluation for suspected pulmonary hypertension.144Chapter 3A Comparison of Cardiac Qptput Measured by Thermodilutional Methods & by the Physioflow 1 Thoracic Bioimpedance Device in subjects being investigated forPulmonary Hypertension1453.1 IntroductionFor years, the clinical gold standard test for measming cardiac output has been by the thennodilutional method. This has been widely validated against gold standard experimental methods.With regards to the use of the thennodilutional method in subjects with pulmonary hypertension, its accuracy has been questioned, but it is now in routine use. In a number of studies, it has been shown to overestimate cardiac output as compared to Pick and dye dilutional methods, the experimental gold standards (Branthwaite, M. A. et al 1968; Hsia, C. C. et al 1995; Mackenzie, J. D. et al 1986; Russell, A. E. et al 1990; van, Grondelle A. et al 1983) at rest and during exercise.Since 1966, (Kubicek, W. G. et al 1966) cardiac output has been monitored experimentally by measuring the electrical impedance changes across the thorax. There have been several equations and devices developed over the past 30 years to measure this, with varying but improving accuracy (Bernstein, D. P. 1986; Sramek, B. B et al 1983). The accuracy, reliability and reproducibility of these devices in clinical practice, however have not been good enough to contemplate their use either as a replacement or an adjunct to current clinical gold standard methods (Warburton, D. E. et al 1999).Recently a new device, the Physioflow 1 (Physioflow, Type PF05L1, Manatee, France) bioimpedance device, was developed after technical improvements occurred in the hardware (a new generation of analog technology allows the Physio Flow to improve signal filtering and stability and provide better data processing), and the basic equation has been adjusted. The equation has been modified in order to overcome the difficulties146in evaluating blood resistivity (p), the distance between recording electrodes (L) and baseline impedance (Zo) used in the Kubicek and Sramek-Bernstein equations. There have been several studies investigating the accuracy and reproducibility of the physioflow in clinical practice. Charloux et al (2000), investigated a number of subjects with respiratory conditions (COPD, n=^ 26, sleep apnoea, n=14) at rest and during exercise, and found that a strong correlation was obtained between the physioflow determined cardiac output and the Pick derived cardiac output values, of 0.89 (p<0.001) at rest and of 0.85 (p<0.001) during exercise. Similar results have been found by both Bougauit et al (2005) and Richards et al (2001). The physioflow seems to be more accurate in a clinical practice when used in a number of clinical conditions and situations compared to older devices.This device has not been validated for use in subjects with pulmonary hypertension, and a study to investigate its usefulness in this was undertaken.1473.2 Methods3.2.1. Data SubjectsAll the subjects were patients at the Scottish Pulmonary Vascular Unit between October 2001 and July 2003, who had been admitted for routine investigations, which included measurement of thennodilutional cardiac output, of their suspected pulmonary hypertension. There were 30 subjects examined on 33 occasions, and with 32 sets of 3 cardiac output measurements undertaken whilst breathing air, (table 3.1, n^-33), 7 whilst breathing oxygen, 12 breathing a nitric oxide and oxygen combination (NO/O2) and 7 whilst exercising (table 3.2). There were 13 males & 17 females. The mean (±S.D.) age was 58.2 (± 13.8) years. The general demographics are seen in table 3.1 & 3.4.4 subjects were normals without pulmonary hypertension and the other 26 had pulmonaiy hypertension due to the following causes, 3 with COPD, 6 with Connective tissue disease (CTD), 1 due to portopulmonary (portopulm.) hypertension, 7 due to idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH), 6 due to chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) and in one subject, at the time of the study the exact cause of pulmonary hypertension was still to be established.

Subject numbers corresponds with subjects in table 3.1.3.2.2. ProcedureThe physioflow 1, cardiac output bio-impedance device, was set up and calibrated before the patient connnenced right heart catheterisation. Blood pressure was initially inputted at this time. Thereafter, a designate operator for the physioflow-1 cardiac output bio-impedance device was only then allocated, if staffing levels permitted. Further adjustments to the device, and further blood pressure adjustments were only made in 10 subjects. During the clinical procedure three sets of thermodilutional cardiac output measurements ( C O t h e r m )  were taken when felt to be clinically relevant, and bio­impedance cardiac output data was noted at the same time (COpp). The bio-impedance device was set to give measurements over a 15 second interval. Several sets of thermodilutional cardiac output data were made until three values matched within 10% or 0.5L/min of each other. This was then averaged to obtain a single value. Only the bioimpedance measurements taken at the same time as the selected thermodilutional measurements were noted and averaged.During the right heart catheterisation, pulmonary artery pressures (Diastolic, mean and systolic pulmonary artery pressure, DPAP, MPAP, SPAP), right atrial pressure, (RAP), and pulmonary arteiy wedge pressure, (PAWP) were measured.Spirometry results (forced expiratoiy volume in 1 second, FEVi, Forced vital capacity FVC, & diffusion coefficient, KCO) were obtained by a vitalograph, in 14 patients.1553.2.3 EthicsEthical approval was provided by the West Ethics committee. North Glasgow NHS University Trust. All subjects gave informed consent for thoracic bioimpedance cardiac output measurements as part of their clinical evaluation for suspected pulmonary hypertension.3.2.3. StatisticsPopulation data was analysed to give values +/- standard deviations. Comparisons between the measurements obtained by both methods was initially performed by linear regression, and then analysed by the Bland Altman method. This was done for all the results, and sub-analysed for the results whilst receiving air, oxygen, nitric oxide, or during exercise, and also for the subjects with IPAH, CTD, & CTPEH individually.The actual change, as well percentage change, from baseline (on air) to receiving oxygen, nitric oxide, or with exercise were compared between thermodilutional results and bio-impedance results.These actual and percentage differences between the thermodilutional results and bio­impedance results were compared with spirometry and right heart catheterisation data for the subjects in order to ascertain whether there was any underlying reason for the differences in cardiac output data obtained.1563.3. ResultsThe correlation coefficient squared of the two techniques was r^  = 0.463 (p < 0.001) when all the data was analyzed, and gave a regression equation of COpf = 1.924 + C O t h e r m  • 0.844 (L*min'^), for all 57 sets of measurements, as shown in figure 3.1a. & 3.1c. A comparison (by the Bland-Altman method) of the two techniques was made for all 57 measurements, as shown in figures 3.1b & 3.Id, and the total mean difference (COpF - C O t h e r m )  (± standard deviation) was found to be 1.21 (± 1.85) L*min""""% (giving 95% confidence intervals of between -2.44 and 4.86 L*min'^). The total mean difference (COpp - C O t h e r m )  (± standard deviation) as expressed as a percentage of mean of COpp and C O t it e r m  was found to be 23.35 (± 35.9) %.If, to avoid overrepresentation of individuals, only the first result of subject 5 was taken as well as only measurements taken on air at rest, the correlation coefficient squared of the two techniques was r^  = 0.152 (p < 0.019) when all the data was analyzed, and gave a regression equation of COpp ^  3.38 + C O t h e r m  • 0.451 (L«min^), for the 35 sets of measurements. A comparison (by the Bland-Altman method) of the two techniques was made for the 35 measurements, and the total mean difference (COpp - C O t p e m v i)  ( ±  standard deviation) was found to be 1.03 (± 1.93) L*min \  (giving 95% confidence intervals of between -2.83 and 4.89 L#miif^).

Ihe continuous thick horizontal line represents the line o f  origin o f  the x-axis, the thin continuotts line indicate the means difference or bias and the broken lines, the limits o f agreement (defined as mean ±2S.D.).Stepwise regression analysis was performed on the mean difference of the two methods188(COpF -C O th e r m ) to investigate whether other haemodynamic or lung function parameters may have been responsible for the difference in results between the two methods. This was only performed where the results were available, on 25 subjects with regards to mean pulmonary arterial pressure, (MPAP), systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (SPAP), diastolic pulmonary arterial pressure (DPAP), pulmonary arterial pulse pressure (SPAP-DPAP, PAlPP), pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP), Right atrial pressure (RAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance, (PVR), and on 13 subjects with respect to forced expiratory volume in 1 second, (FEVi), forced vital capacity (FVC), percent of predicted FEVi, and FYC, ratio of FEVi/FVC, carbon dioxide transfer coefficient, (KCO ) and percent predicted KCO. No conelations were found.The small number of subjects, the large number of covariates and the inter-correlation of some of the covariates, the stepwise regression analysis should have been biased towards positive results. The results of this analysis, being negative, suggests that none of these variables were related to the mean difference of the two methods (COpf - C O th e r m ). In  order to minimise errors, the stepwise regression analysis was repeated, with only MPAP, PAWP, RAP and PVR for 25 subjects and no coiTelation was still found.1893,4. DiscussionThe results of this study found that the physioflow bioimpedance (Physioflow, Type PF05L1, Manatee, France) device overestimates cardiac output when compared to thermodilutional results. When all the results were analysed, the overestimation was estimate to be on average 1.21 (± 1.85) L#min % and the total mean difference (C O p f - C O th e r m ) (± standard deviation), expressed as a percentage of mean of C O p f and C O th eiu vi was found to be 23.35 (± 35.9) %. This latter result is similar to results obtained when evaluating other methods of now validated clinical cardiac output devices in the statistical variation, except with a positive bias (Bein, B. et al 2004; Durkin, R. J. et al 1994; Hoeper, M. M. et al 1999). Positive and negative errors in measurement are often be seen under certain clinical conditions, in routinely used clinical devices, for instance the positive bias often seen with thermodilutional methods in the people with low output states (Kohanna, F. H. et al 1977; Nishikawa, T. et al 1993) or negative bias in valvular heart disease (Cigarroa, R. G. et al 1989).There are several areas of introducible errors in the measurement of cardiac output by thoracic bioimpedance in this study, which may explain the overestimate. These may include operator error and procedural differences, and that the other studies compared the bioimpedance cardiac output obtained against results obtained by Tick's method or by echocardiography rather than thermodilutional derived cardiac output. With regards to operator error, all results obtained dming the early period of the learning curve have been included. Further error may have been introduced in those subjects where the device was left unadjusted during the right heart catheterisation, even when signal difficulties may have developed. A further issue was that in those subjects in whom the190physioflow (Physioflow, Type PF05L1, Manatee, France) device was left unattended, further blood pressure measurements, just prior to the thermodilutional measurements, were not inputted.During the straight leg raising, the cardiac output derived by the thermodilutional method, measures cardiac output over on average 30 seconds. If repeated 3 times for accuracy, the cardiac output obtained would be an average over 1-2 minutes. This would be satisfactory, if cardiac output was constant, but in a clinical context, with ill subjects, the work load achieved, and thus the cardiac output would also vary. The physioflow (Physioflow, Type PF05L1, Manatee, France), however took measurements over 15 seconds, and so may be checking a different cardiac output timescale (value) as opposed to the thermodilutional cardiac output timescale. Furthermore, the accuracy of the results obtained by the thennodilutional method, when testing subjects with tricuspid regurgitation and thus pulmonary hypertension, has been questioned after a number of studies (Hoeper, M. M. et al 1999).When sub-analysed by underlying disease condition, we found that the correlations for normals was better than previous studies, with a correlation coefficient squared of the two techniques of r^  = 0.96 (p < 0.001) and measurements and the total mean difference (C O pF  -C O t ite r m ) (± standard deviation) was found to be 0.45 (± 0.58) L»min""""\ However in all the pulmonary hypertensive subgroups analyzed, the total mean difference between the methods had a positive bias, [IPAIT, 1.19 (± 2.00) L#min""""\ CTEPH3.95 (± 2.01) L#m in\C TD  0.84 (± 0.72) L 'm in \IL D  1.30 (± 0.17) L#miiT^]. Unfortunately, the numbers of individual subjects in each group were small, and it may191be that one or two individuals in each group may have biased the result.With regards to the initial correlation of the combined data, COpf = 1.924 + COymRM • 0.844 (L*miA^), the strong correlation is largely driven by the good correlation found in the normal subjects C O p f == 1.165 + C O th e r m  ® 0.909 (L*min‘ )^, as in most of the pulmonary hypertensive patients, the correlation was weaker.The resting data whilst inlialing air was used in an attempt to comparing both techniques, without the pooling of variable amounts of data from individuals, leading to bias. This demonstrated that the correlation in the various subgroups of patients, was similar, but usually weaker, than when all the data was combined [in IPAH subjects, (COpF -COtierm) (± standard deviation) was found to be 1.19 (± 2.00) L#min'^ when all the data is used and 2.17 (± 2.17) L#min'^j as compared to only using measurements at rest on air. Wlien analysing percentage change in cardiac output data for either oxygen, nitric oxide/oxygen inhalations and exercising, the correlation was found to be particular poor in the pulmonary hypertensive disease subgroup data of inhaling nitric oxide and oxygen. The poor correlation may have been as a result of the data from 4 individuals having the difference in percentage changes in cardiac output between the physioflow and thermodilutional methods being greater than 10%.Critchley & Critchley (1998) found that in subjects with large lung fluid content, cardiac output measured by a thoracic impedance device underestimated CO. This is consistent with the results of subject 34 who had portopulmonaiy hypertension. This was felt to be secondary to the differential of the aorta’s change in impedance with192respect to time (dZ/dt) being minored by the pulmonary’s dZ/dt (the lung resistance is usually higher, and conductivity lower, than mediastinal tissues, but this is reversed if there is a large fluid content in the lungs). Bougault et al (2005) found that in subjects with COPD during maximal exercise, tire results obtained by thoracic impedance, underestimated cardiac output, and speculated that for the opposite reasons in COPD, the values obtained by thoracic bioimpedance methods may overestimate the levels in their COPD subjects. In subjects with pulmonary hypertension due to arterial disease or emboli, it is likely that the lung water volume would be reduced, especially compared to normals during exercise, and that the lung impedance would increase as compared to aortic, so we can speculate that the findings are consistent with those found in other studies.Bougault et al found in their study in 2005, that in subjects with mild to moderate COPD, during upright exercise, the physioflow overestimated SV and thus cardiac output when compared with Pick derived measurements. However, the trend of change in cardiac output followed changes in cardiac output trends.The percentage changes from baseline seen with the physioflow (Physioflow, Type PF05L1, Manatee, France) device were better correlated then actual values and this may suggest that the physioflow 1 derived cardiac output may be adequate to observe changes in CO within individual subjects. The correlation coefficient squared of the two techniques in the 21 subjects, 26 paired data, r^  = 0.81 (p < 0.001) and gave a regression equation of % ACOppBaseline = 3.16 + %ACOTi-iEiuviBaseline » 0.916 (%), (figure 3.4a.) The Bland-Altman comparison (figure 3.4b) of the two techniques (%ACOppBaseline -193%ACOTHERMBaseline) (± standard deviation) was foimd to be 2.08 (± 12.5) %, (giving 95% confidence intervals of between -23.0 and 27.1 %). The total mean difference (%ACOpFBaseline -%ACOTtmRMBaseline) (± standard deviation) as expressed as a percentage of mean of %ACOppBaseline and %ACOTiERMBaseline was found to be 14.7 (± 90.7) %. Unfortunately, unlike Bougault et al (2005), we do not have data on stepwise exercise, demonstrating the physioflow 1 (Physioflow, Type PF05L1, Manatee, France) follows the cardiac output changes seen by the Fick method, in subjects with pulmonary hypertension.Our study demonstrates that the physioflow (Physioflow, Type PF05L1, Manatee, France) gave slightly more positive values as compared to thermodilutional values. Assuming that the thermodilutional methods are accurate, the Physioflow (Physioflow, Type PF05L1, Manatee, France) could not be recommended from this study as a method of getting accurate results for absolute CO in clinical situations. However, the thermodilutional method of cardiac output measurement has been reported to underestimate the cardiac output in comparison the Fick method, when subjects have tricuspid regurgitation (Hoeper, M. M. et al 1999). The results of this study, however, demonstrate that the physioflow device is probably accurate in measuring changes in trends in cardiac output within an individual. The degree of accuracy, under various physiological, pathological and pharmacological states may vary. This will allow the physioflow (Physioflow, Type PF05L1, Manatee, France) to be a useful device in measuring CO changes during exercise or pharmacological interventions.194Chapter 4Viability of Pulmonary Pressure Flow Plots During Routine Clinical Investigations of Subjects with Possible Pulmonary Hypertension1954,1 IntroductionPulmonary hypertension is defined as a condition in which mean pulmonary arterial pressure at rest is elevated above 25mHg or 30mmHg. In its purest form, idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, is a condition with a historically poor prognosis, but which more recently a number of new therapeutic options have been developed (British Cardiac Society Guidelines 2001).Traditionally, haemodynamic assessment has been made whilst the subject is at rest and supine, with a change in 'pulmonary vascular resistance' (PVR) being one of the most important parameters measured. However, it has been shown that changes in PVR can be misleading as the pulmonary arterial pressure, although linearly related to cardiac output (CO) in the physiological range usually has a positive extrapolated intercept (McGregor, M. et al 1985; Snidennan, A. D. et al 1988). This means that if there is a passive increase in CO, there will be a corresponding increase in pulmonary arterial pressure, without any change in the rmderlying pulmonary vascular state. Therefore, the calculated PVR would seem to fall, without any real change in the resistance, compliance or dilatation of the blood vessels.This can be resolved this by plotting pressiue flow cinves, created from paired data of mean pulmonary arterial pressure and cardiac output (McGregor, M. et al 1985; Snidennan, A. D. et al 1988). The change in cardiac output can be generated via exercise, or diverting blood through one lung (Naeije, R. 1996). This has been performed experimentally in animals, and in a few human studies, but only in very few subjects with pulmonaiy hypertension (Evans, P. et al 1971; Janicki, J. S. et al 1985; Leeman, M. et al 1990; McGregor, M. et al 1985; Naeije, R. et al 1994), and has not196been used clinically. Changes in the slope of the plot, or the intercept reflect changes in the resistance of the pulmonary vasculature.The object of this study was to assess the feasibility of producing pressure flow plots via exercise in a clinical context, and whether clinical effects phannacologically on the true pulmonary vasculature could be detected clinically on an individual basis.1974.2 Methods4.2.1. Patient group & EthicsThe study was approved by the ethics committee of the West Glasgow's NHS trust, and informed consent was obtained from all the patients. Thirty consecutive patients consented, but only twenty-four were successfully studied (11 males and 13 females) (Table 4.1). In six subjects, the study was unsuccessful, due to equipment failure, 2 due to the micromometer tipped pulmonary artery catheter and 4 due to problems with the thoracic bioimpedance device. The mean (±S.D.) age of the studied subjects was 56.6 years (± 13.5), but ranged from 33 to 81. Three turned out to be normal subjects, five had idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH), five pulmonary hypertension secondary to comiective tissue disorder (CTD), four had chronic tliromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), two pulmonary hypertension due to interstitial lung disease (ILD), two due to chronic obstructive pulmonaiy disease (COPD), one found to have portopulmonary hypertension and two as a consequence of left sided heart disease (PVH). Ten had more than a 20% drop in pulmonaiy vascular resistance (PVR) to nitric oxide (NO, a pulmonary vasodilator) nine did not, and 4 were not studied. Mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) ranged from 15 mmHg to 99 mniHg, with a mean (±S.D.) of 48.9 (± 19.5) mmHg, right atrial pressure, 0 to 47 mmHg, mean 11.0 (± 9,4) mmHg, pulmonary artery wedge pressure 1 to 28 mmHg with a mean of 10.8 (± 7.5) mmHg and PVR ranging from 0.5 to 37 mmHg • L“^ m in , with a mean of 11.1 (± 8.6) mmHg min . In total 86 studies were performed, 30 each whilst inhaling air or a nitric oxide/ oxygen combination, and 26 whilst inhaling oxygen.198Table 4.1: Subject demographics and haemodynamic supine restingSubjectNumberStudyNumber InitialsMPAP SPAP(DPAPmmHgRAP PAWP CO PVR( i n n i H g  /  L . i n i n ’ )Age Sex Diagnosis Vaso­dilatorResponse1 1 M,C 17 23 11 47 8.1 2 55 F normal N/A2 2 i,c 8 14 2 1 14 3.7 0.0 40 F normal3 3 B,Ri 15 24 3 12 9 5.6 0.5 37 F normal N /A5 4 G,C 57 91 37 6 7 5.5 9 49 M IPAIi N5 5 G,C 56 90 32 5 8 4.6 10.4 50 M IPAH N5 6 G,C 55 85 34 11 10 4.2 10.7 50 M IP AH N6 7 W,F 79 137 48 11 14 3.3 20 67 M IPAH Y7 8 E,M 63 115 23 14 15 3.7 13 73 F IPAH Y8 9 W ,0'H 51 82 28 4 2 3.0 16.3 61 ,M IPAH Y8 10 W ,0 ’H 51 82 28 4 2 3.0 16.3 61 M IPAH Y8 11 W ,0'H 51 82 28 4 2 3,0 16.3 61 M IPAH Y9 12 s ,s 60 103 60 10 3 4.5 13 45 F IPAH N13 13 R,C 49 77 27 8 5 3.6 12 54 F CTD Y14 14 Y,McB 48 79 33 0 1 2.6 14 48 F CTD Y15 15 I,P 36 62 17 6 5 4.4 7.3 46 F CTD Y16 16 J,P 99 130 82 9 4 2.4 37.1 59 M CTD Y17 17 K,S 36 61 22 2 3,9 4 62 F CTD N17 18 K,S 37 62 23 3 3.9 5 63 F CTD N17 19 K,S 38 63 24 4 3.9 6 64 F CTD N20 20 TF 63 100 36 20 20 3.7 12 71 M CTEPH N21 21 s ,o 46 79 27 8 5 11 74 M CTEPH N/A26 22 G,S 66 107 40 14 23 4.1 10.6 50 M CTEPH N27 23 G,W 56 98 33 9 7 3.3 14.9 37 M CTEPH N2 8 2 4 W,F 39 54 28 18 12 2.6 5 71 M ILD Y30 25 B,Ra 57 81 44 3 4 2.0 26.1 33 F ILD Y31 26 R,McD 43 74 26 11 8 2.2 16 60 M COPD N32 27 M,T 30 50 10 4 13 4.1 4 81 F COPD N34 28 S,C 19 31 9 10 15 10.7 0,4 48 F portopulm N/A36 29 F.B 43 60 26 9 22 4.9 4.2 65 F PVH N1 37 30 J,B 52 86 32 19 28 5.4 4.2 73 M PVH Y4.2.2. Equipment and ExperimentsInitial haemodynamic evaluation was performed with the patient supine and breathing room air, according to our standard protocol as described in chapter 2.3. The inhaled gas was delivered to the patient, as described in chapter 2.5.1, and shown in Figures 2.14 a-199c and Figure 4.1. The right heart catheter (Gaeltec, Dunvegan, Isle of Skye), its insertion storage and processing are described in chapter 2.1. Cardiac output was measured non- invasively by thoracic electrical bioimpedance (PhysioFlow 1, Manatee, France) as described in chapter 2.2 and the pulmonary pressuie and cardiac output data combined as in chapter 2.5. Between 4-18 sets, [mean (± S.D.) of 14 (± 3.2), on air mean (± S.D.)12.1 (± 3.7), with oxygen 14.6 (±2.5), and with the nitric oxide oxygen combination, 14.9 (± 2.6)] of paired of data were collected at rest and exercise respectively on each subject. The exercise consisted of a maximum of 3 minutes, or less if the subjects could not manage it, of alternate straight leg raising. All subjects had almost a full resting haemodynamics performed within 24 hours of the exercise test during routine right heart catheterization with a swan-gantz catheter, when MPAP, Svo2, PWCP and CO were initially measured.The nitric oxide was supplied by a pure NO source cylinder (HOC, UK) and delivered via a mouth piece (figure 4.1). The mixture of 02/NO was sampled by a NO sampling device (NOXBOXII, Bedford scientific Ltd, Kent, England).200Figure 4.1 : Inhalation gas delivery systemMagill-Mapelson A 1.6m with2L reservoir bag- A .Standard 2 4FElephant tubingSampling tubing to NOxBOxAPL V alveNitric Oxide supply tubingAir/Oxygen supply-15 LAnin2L reservoir bag4.2.3. AnalysisAnalysis of the data obtained was performed using the SPSS 13.0 package as described in chapter 2.7.2014.3. ResultsAll the sets of paired data for all the studies underwent regression analysis with confidence intervals for slope and intercept (tables 4.2, and table 4.3). Scattergrams were reviewed for predicted- actual MPAP versus actual MPAP, and were all found to be reasonable. An anova test of non-linearity (table 4.3), the visual assessment of histograms of frequency of standardized residuals and normal probability plots of standardized residuals were reviewed, to assess the linearity or suitability for linear regression of the produced lines. An ancova test of parallelism (table 4.4) as well as comparing the confidence intervals of the slope and intercept were undertaken to assess if the slopes (or intercepts) were statistically different.Figidre 4.2a80 -G O -O  D O  A40 -S 20-I 2 3Cardiac Lidex (Cl, L*iniii^*in^)40 1Figure 4.2b2028 0 -&  6 0 -20 -3 50 2 41Caidiac liidex (CI, )Figures 4.2a & h: Examples o f  regression plots produced from individual subjects, using data derived dttring a 3 minute straight leg raising exercise test, and from a micromanometer tipped pulmonary artery catheter and thoracic bio-impedance (a) example ofpoor quality plots (b) example o f good quality plots.Examples of the variable quality of plots produced are shown in figures 4.2a & b.The combined number of subjects was 24, and they underwent sets 30 studies, producing 86 linear regression lines (a single line for each exercise test). Of these lines, only forty two were able to be tested for non-linearity and 3 were statistically found to be non-linear. The histograms of frequency of residuals and the normal probability plot203of residuals, in more than 50% of the lines, were also visually poor, with either a poor normal distribution or deviation from the line of identity. The combination of these three tests despite all the scattergrams being reasonable, suggest that about a third of the plots could produce lines which were satisfactorily straight.The analysis of differences in slope, performed by the ancova test of parallelism, (covariance) found only a significant difference in only 26 pairing of slopes, out of 86. The confidence intervals for slopes did not overlap in only 9 pairs of slopes.The intercept had a standard error that was on average 51% of intercept, (± 109%) but with a median of 26.52% and range of 5.38%- 966.67%. Seven of the 86 intercepts had a standard error of greater than 100% of baseline, and if these were excluded the mean standard error would have been 30.1% of intercept, (± 21.0%) but with a median of 25.7% and range of 5.38% to 99.07%. Only 32 of the 86 lines had a standard error of less than 20% of baseline. The slope had a standard error that was on average 105% of baseline, (± 359%) but with a median of 15.1% and range of 1.4 to 2767%. Ten of the 86 slopes had a standard error of greater than 100% of baseline, and if these were excluded the mean standard error would have been 20.0% of baseline slope, (± 20.7%) but with a median of 14.27% and range of 1.4% to 98.6%. Only 49 of the 85 lines had a standard error of the slope less than 20% of baseline. In addition, only 65 of the of the linear regression analysis were significant (Table 4.3).204STUDY GAS constant Sig.95% Co lnter\ con.

DiscussionThe results of the study showed some variability. Of the 62 subjects asked to participate in the study, only 30 agreed. Of this cohort, due to equipment failure, only 24 underwent successful studies (80%), 4 failed due to complete failure of the impedance cardiac output monitor (13% of those studied) and 2 (7%) due to a failure of the micromanometer tipped catheter to measure or record accurately the pulmonary artery pressures.86 sets of paired data were successfully performed, whilst supine at rest and exercising, as part of 30 experiments. From the 86 sets of paired data, only 42 could be tested statistically for linearity and 3 failed the test of linearity, leaving only 45 % successful. Furthennore, the confidence intervals for the slope & the intercept were so wide, that only 32 of 86 obtained had slopes that had 95% confidence intervals that were within 20% of the base levels, and 65 with intercepts that had 95% confidence intervals that were within 20% of the base levels.These results indicate that at least on an individual basis, reliable Fressure-Flow (P~Q) plots generated by a combination of a micromanometer tipped catheter, thoracic bioimpedance, and supine straight leg raising exercise is not feasible in clinical practice in subjects investigated for pulmonary hypertension.Experimentally, however, cumulative effects in individual patient groups may still be detectable, if the results from several individuals were pooled. This method may still be useful in the investigation of effects of diseases and phannaceuticals in human experiments.214The thoracic bioimpedance Cardiac index seemed to be the less reliable of the two devices. If the cardiac index and the pulmonary arterial pressure values obtained during each episode of exercise were plotted against time, the measured mean pulmonary artery pressures followed more closely the exercise periods, with less variability than the increase in cardiac output measurements. It may be that another method of measurement for continuous cardiac output, like pulse contour continuous cardiac output (PiCCO) or continuous lithium dilutional cardiac output (LiDCO) (Warburton, D. E. et al 1999), or another exercise mechanism, like a supine cycle ergometer, may give better results. It is however worth noting that the LiDCO and PiCCO devices have not been validated for use during exercise. Simminou et al (2002), used a supine cycle ergometer to produce the exercise, and states that in all seven subjects the plots produced were recto-linear, but the statistical evidence to back up this statement was not produced.It is also worth noting that although we aimed to collect a total of 15-17 sets of paired data, 4 during rest and 11/12 during 3 minutes exercise, a large percentage of subjects could not maintain this exercise regime. In only 46 out of 86 studies, were 15 or more sets of paired data collected, and of these only 9 out of 30 of the studies completed the full regime whilst inhaling air, during exercise. The fraction of incomplete studies, in which the full term of exercise was not completed, when divided into disease categories, was as follows, 6 of 26 studies in IPAH subjects, 8 out of 12 studies in subjects with CTEPH, 12 out of 19 studies in subjects with CTD, and 9 out of 10 studies in subjects with COPD or ILD. The average time exercising achieved in those who did not complete the exercise was 110 secs (100 seconds in the 19 air inhalation studies, and215120 seconds in the 25 incomplete studies inhaling 0% or NO/O2).The linear regression analysis of sets of paired data include 4 taken just prior to exercise, as it was assumed that the anticipation of exercise, would lead to a slight increase in cardiac output. This was not always seen. The importance of this is that the resting values may be too contiguous, and alter the weighting of the linear regression equation. Furthermore, with the large numbers of incomplete exercise studies, the influence would be even gieater.Possible methods of increasing the number of sets of paired data would be to do repeated exercise tests or to continue monitoring pressure flow data after exercise. The problem with the former method is the fact that we were dealing with sick individuals. If an individual study is performed, without any problems, and with the pressme and flow values returning to baseline within the six-minute rest period, excluding set up time, the study lasted a minimum of 1/2 hr. In practice, the study would last at least an hour or more, from start to finish, and the individuals in whom repeated values are most required, were those who were unable to exercise for the full 3 minutes as they were fairly exhausted. Repeating the tests on the same day in such cases is clearly not feasible and other factors may change if the study was to be repeated on another occasion. With the latter possible method, to continue monitoring pressure flow data after exercise, the subjects in our study were detached from the gas delivery apparatus immediately post exercise, often at their own request, especially when inhaling air, and so the experimental conditions were altered. Furthermore, even if this had not been the case, the fact that the subject was not exercising, may also have altered the conditions.216The importance of attempts to eontinue to develop a method of producing pressure flow plots clinically, can be demonstrated by the paper by Simminou et al (2002), as well as chapters 1.6. Simminou et al (2002) demonstrate that there are clear differences in subjects at baseline and at 3 months after prostacyclin treatment, without a significant difference in traditional haemodynamic outcomes, which may be the reason for improved exercise tolerance. Future research might demonstrate differences in response to treatments or prognosis.Finally, a study investigating the use of dobutamine as a method of producing pressure flow plots clinically would be useful (Naeije, R. et al 1994)..217Chapter 5Analysis of the Pulmonary Pressure-Flow Response in Man during Exercise whilst inhaling Pharmacological Agents. & a Sub-analysis of the Response within DiseaseSubsets218 :■I5.1 Introduction 1As previously mentioned, the term and calculation of pulmonaiy vascular resistance, (PVR), which is the calculation in common usage in both the literature, and medical practice, is misleading. It is only correct where the pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (PAWP), which is a sunogate marker for left atrial pressure, is also the critical closing pressure. The critical closing pressure is the pressure at which blood flow ceases, and this may be at a higher pulmonary arterial pressure than left atrial pressure (McGregor, M. et al 1985). This may be due to alveolar pressure (on pulmonary capillaries (West, J. B. et al 1965)) or other factors external to the blood vessels, or due to elastic recoil of the blood vessel wall (Burton, A. C. 1951). However, by ignoring the critical pressure, an error is introduced in the analysis of any change in ‘resistance’, in that the ‘resistance’ as taken by PVR, may seem to decrease as cardiac output increases, without any change in the vasomotor, compliance, elasticity or any other physical properties of the pulmonaiy vasculature (Chapter 1.6) (McGregor, M. et al 1985).Several authors have now published data, demonstrating that pressure-flow plots, which demonstrate more accurately the state of the pulmonary vasculature, could be produced in both animals and humans, by various mechanisms (Evans, P. et al 1971; McGregor, M. et al 1985; Naeije, R. et al 1994; Naeije, R. 1996; Reeves, J. T. et al 1988).In our previous studies, (Chapter 4), we have shown that it is possible to produce such pressure-flow plots, in humans, using a combination of a micromanometer tipped pulmonaiy arterial catheter, and a non-invasive, thoracic bioimpedance cardiac output, during straight leg raising exercise, under clinical conditions in ‘diseased’ humans, with219a varying degree of suecess. An analysis of the pooled data of all the studied subjects, to review the response to the pressure-flow plots to receiving air, oxygen (O2) or a nitric oxide/oxygen combination (NO/O2), and a further sub-analysis of the data, was undertaken, to review whether differing disease subgroups responded in different ways.2205.2 Methods5.2.1. Patient group & EthicsRecruitment and Ethics are described in Chapter 2. In total, twenty four were successfully studied (Table 4.1). The data was pooled for all the studies, and where there were sufficient numbers of subjects, in a patient disease group, and then further analyzed. For the subgroup analysis, only the normal subject group (n=3), the idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) group (n=5), the pulmonary hypertension secondary to connective tissue disorder (CTD) group (n=5), and the chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) (n=4) (Table 5.1) were there sufficient subjects. In the 3 normal subjects, all 3 were females, the mean (± S.D.) age was 44 (± 9) years. The idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) group, consisted of 3 males and 2 females, 3 of which were vasodilator responders, and whose mean (± S.D.) age was 59 (± 11) years. The five pulmonary hypertension secondary to connective tissue disorder (CTD) group consisted of 4 females and 1 male, 4 vasodilator responders and 1 non responder, with an mean age of 54 ± 7 years. The four subjects in the chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) group, were all males, 3 were vasodilator non-responders, and their mean (± S.D.) age was 58 (±18) years.

The inhaled gas was delivered to the patient, as described in chapter 2.5.1, and shown in Figures 2.14 a- c and Figure 4.1. The right heart catheter (Gaeltec, Dunvegan, Isle of Skye), its insertion222storage and processing are described in chapter 2.1. Cardiac output was measured non- invasively by thoracic electrical bioimpedance (PhysioFlow 1, Manatee, France) as described in chapter 2.2 and the pulmonary pressure and cardiac output data combined as in chapter 2.5. Between 4-18 sets, [combined mean (± S.D.) of 14 (± 3.2), on air mean (± S.D.) 12.1 (± 3.7), with oxygen 14.6 (± 2.5), and with the nitric oxide/oxygen combination 14.9 (± 2.6)] of paired of data were collected at rest and exercise on each subject. All subjects had almost a full resting haemodynamics performed within 24 hours of the exercise test during routine right heart catheterization with a swan-gantz catheter, when MPAP, PWCP and CO were initially measured.The nitric oxide was supplied as previously described (chapter 4.2, figure 4.1).5.2.3. AnalysisAnalysis of the data obtained was performed using the SPSS 13.0 package as described in chapter 2.7.2235.3 ResultsThe combined data of all 24 subjects produced 308 sets of paired sets of data for inhaling oxygen, 357 for inhaling oxygen and 372 for inhaling the nitric oxide/oxygen combination.

The slopes produced in the group of ‘normal’ patients ranged from 2.6-4.1 mmHg •min «m^* L '\  which is higher than that previously noted for normal individuals (previously noted at -1.5 mmHg*min»m^*L''). Other studies have found that the slope in normals was 1 mmHg • in fit young men (Reeves, J. T. et al 1988), and assuming an average B.S.A. of 1.9, this would give a slope of 2.85 mmHg •min •m^^ There are several possible explanations for any discrepancies between our result in normals and findings from previous studies.Firstly, most of the studies looking at pulmonary pressure flow responses in man obstructed one of the main pulmonary arteries thereby doubling the flow of blood down the other artei*y. This avoided the possible error introduced of increasing left arterial pressure during exercise, which may alter the resultant slope. A second error is the action of straight leg raising exercise, which may alter the alveolar effects on the vasculature, as with this form of exercise, the abdominal muscles are often involved, increasing intra-abdominal pressure and thus splinting the diaphragm and altering thoracic pressure. As, the data in Chapter 3 demonstrated, the measurement of cardiac output by thoracic impedance may give reasonable trends, but the actual values of cardiac output derived from this method did not match accurately those derived from thermodilutional methods. Finally, in subject 1, the slope was significantly steeper than subjects 2 & 3 (Table 4.2a), and this may have biased the pooled result.In the ‘normal’ subgroup, the NO/O2 combination seemed to reduce the slope, and thus the resistance by the most.235In the IPAH subgi’oup, the slopes whilst inhaling air or O2 or NO/O2 combinations, were all similar, (8.6, 9.6, 9.0 imnHg #min • m^# L‘  ^ respectively), but analysis found a statistically difference between the air and the oxygen subgroups, with a suggestion that with high flow oxygen, the resistance actually increased. This is not what was expected. Both subjects 4 & 5 demonstrated a steeper individual slope for O2 as opposed to air. Although not statistically significant, the slope of the air group was less than the NO/O2 group, but the latter had a lower critical closing pressure (47 mmHg with air as opposed to 38 mmHg with NO/O2).Again in the CTD group of patients, all the slopes were similar (6.2 mmHg «min • m L'  ^for air, 6.5 mmHg •min • m^  ^ for O2 , 6.4 mmHg •min • m^^ L'  ^for the NO/O2 group), but the slope was significantly different when comparing air with oxygen, (p=0.003). Again, both O2 and NO/O2 results seem to suggest that resistance is increased when inhaling these gases. The critical closing pressure however seems to be lower when giving the O2 or NO/O2 mixture (closing pressure of air was 45mHg, O2 42mmHg, and NO/O2 38mmHg).In the final subgroup, of four CTEPH patients, there was a significant drop in slope (or resistance) from the baseline when inhaling air (slope of 10.3 mmHg •min • m^^ L'^) to both O2 inhalation (slope 8.2 mmHg •min • nf* L '\  p= 0.001) and NO/O2 inhalation study (slope 7.5 mmHg •min • m^  ^ U \  p<0.001) and also between the O2 study and the NO/O2 study of pooled data (p<0.001), which is what was expected in all the patient subgroups.236As mentioned earlier, the slope of the ‘normal’ subgroup was twice that which was expected. As previously demonstrated by other authors, the slope (or real resistance) of the IPAH group, was greater than the nonnal subgroup (Castelain, V. et al 2002; Janicki, J. S. et al 1985), but the slope produced here was less than noted in these other studies. The slope in the CTD group was also elevated but less compared to the IPAH group, and the CTEPH group was steeper, suggesting that the baseline resistance was greatest with CTEPH and least with CTD in the pulmonary hypertensive group. The reduction in resistance on giving NO/O2 was greatest for the CTEPH group but seemed to not occur in the other disease groups. In the idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertensive group, although the test for parallelism (or lack of difference) between slopes was non-significant (Table 5.4), the confidence intervals between the air and the NO/O2 slopes overlap (8.1-9.2 an 8.6-9.5 respectively). In this group the NO/O2 slope had a lower intercept (or closing pressure, air 46.83 mmHg (± 2.17) compared to NO/O2 38.65 mmHg (± 1.55).One of the weaknesses of this study was that due to low numbers of subjects, the data could not be split further into vasodilator responders and non-vasodilator responders. Both the IPAH and CTD groups had a preponderance of vasodilator responders (3 out of 5 and 4 out of 5, and the CTEPH group, non-vasodilator responders (at least 3 out of 4). It may be that there is a difference between the vasodilator responders and the non­vasodilator responders, but a larger number of subjects would be required for to divide each of the disease subgroups into differing vasodilator properties.237Chapter 6Pulmonary hypertension^ vasodilator non-responders: Fact or Fiction2386.1 IntroductionThe majority of patients with pulmonary hypertension have a thickened non-responsive vasculatui'e. This was demonstrated by a non-reduction of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) or mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP) to an acute trial of inhaled nitric oxide (NO), one of the most potent and specific pulmonary vasodilators (Peacock, AJ 1996; Zapol, W. M. et al 1994). If a subject was shown to have no response at rest, then it was felt that the pulmonary vasculature could not be affected pharmacologically. However as demonstrated by Castelain et al (2002), PVR measurements alone may not reflect the effects of pharmacological agents on the pulmonary circulation. This is because the extrapolated pressure -flow (P-Q) plot has a positive intercept in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension and other respiratory conditions (Castelain, V. et al 2002; Harris, P. et al 1968; Janicki, J. S. et al 1985). Consequently changes in PVR, which is (MPAP-Left Atrial Pressure [LAP])/CO), may not actually reflect changes to the underlying physiology of the pulmonaiy circulation but simply reflect changes in cardiac output, pushing the pressure up or down a static P- Q plot.The haemodynamic response of a subject to a vasodilator, at rest, on first presentation, is used to divide all patients into vasodilator responders and non-responders, the former having a greater than 20% improvement in either MPAP or PVR (2001), which allows patients to be selected for long term vasodilator therapy or disease targeted therapy (Rubin, L. J. 1997).The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether no response of pulmonary haemodynamics to a vasodilator at rest, (essentially PVR), meant that there was no239change in the P-Q profile, and hence no change in the nature of the pulmonary vasculature. In addition, if any change in the pressm'e-flow profiles was found, was it found in both vasodilator responders and non-responders. The measurements were perfonned with inhaled air, oxygen and a nitric oxide/oxygen (NO/O2) combination.2406.2 Methods6.2.1. Patient group & EthicsThe ethics and recruitment are described in chapters 2,8 and 2.6 respectively. There were 9 subjects in the vasodilator non-responder subgroup, of which 6  were male, 3 female, 2 had Idiopathic pulmonary hypertension (IPAH), one pulmonary hypertension secondary to connective tissue disorder (CTD), 4 secondary to chronic thromboembolic disease (CTEPH), and 2 due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and the mean (± S.D.) age was 58 (± 15) years (Table 6.1a). The diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension was made from the criteria from the 2002-WHO symposium (Simonneau, G. et al 2004).

Study ProtocolInitial haemodynamic evaluation was performed with the patient supine and breathing room air, according to our standard protocol as described in chapter 2.3. The inhaled gas was delivered to the patient, as described in chapter 2.5.1, and shown in Figures 2.14 a-c and Figure 4.1. Cardiac output was measured non-invasively by thoracic electrical bioimpedance (PhysioFlow 1, Manatee, France) and Cardiac Index (Cl) calculated from CO divided by body surface area. This thoracic electrical bioimpedance device has previously been described (Chapter 1.11, 2.2 and 3) (Charloux, A. et al 2000). The results were transferred to Microsoft Excel, and then processed to produce 16-second averages compatible intime with the MPAP. Between 9-19 sets, [vasodilator combined242mean (± S.D.) of 12.5 (± 2.5), on air mean (± S.D.) 10.7 (± 1.5), with oxygen 12.6 (± 2.5), and with the nitric oxide oxygen combination, 14.4 (± 2.1), and non-vasodilator responder combined mean (± S.D.) of 13.3 (+ 3.5), on air mean (± S.D.) 12.6 (± 3.3), with oxygen 13.1 (± 4.3), and with the nitric oxide oxygen combination, 14.1 (± 3.1)] of paired of data were collected at rest and exercise respectively on each subject. The exercise consisted of a maximum of 3 minutes, or less if the subjects could not manage it, of alternate straight leg raising. All subjects had almost a full resting haemodynamics perfonned within 24 hours of the exercise test during routine right heart catheterization with a swan-gantz catheter, at which time MPAP, PWCP and CO were initially measured, except subject 2 1 , who had previously had a vasodilator study, in which he was not a responder, and in whom total pulmonary vascular resistance (MPAP/CO) also had a less than 2 0 % drop with the NO/O2 combination.The nitric oxide was supplied as previously described (chapter 4.2, figure 4.1).6.2.3. AnalysisAnalysis of the data obtained was performed using the SPSS 13.0 package as described in chapter 2.7.2436.3 ResultsThe haemodynamic variables and patient groups are shown in Table 6.1 a & b. In the vasodilator non-responder group, the air and NO/O2 recto-linear lines, did not significantly deviate from linearity. The oxygen recto-linear plot, statistically deviated from linearity (F = 262, p -= 0.001). However, on reviewing the scattergrams, histograms of residuals, and normal probability plots of the residuals, all three lines seem to meet the criteria for linearity.The regression lines for vasodilator responders, were not able to be tested statistically for linearity, due to small study numbers, however on reviewing the scattergrams, histograms of residuals, and normal probability plots of the residuals, all three lines seem to meet the criteria for linearity.4 data points, in the 64 seconds prior to exercise and 5-13 data points, during exercise, were recorded on each patient, producing reasonable visually recto-linear plots in the majority of studies.The slope of the MPAP/CI plot tended to decrease but was not statistically significant in all patients on the NO/O2 mixture as compared to the slope on air. When the data points from the nine patients who were non-vasodilator responders, were pooled the relations between MPAP and Cl were rectilinear (Figure 6.1) with the following equations produced, on air MPAP = lO.HCI + 24.1, = 0.97, p< 0.001, with oxygen, MPAP =7.8.C1 +32.7, R  ^ = 0.97, p< 0.001 and NO/O2 mixture, MPAP -  6.9.C1+ 34.6, R  ^ = 0.98, p<0.001). The slope of the MPAP/CI plot was significantly decreased from air to244oxygen and the to the NO/O2 mixture (Figure 6.1, Table 6.2 & 6.3) (10.1 vs. 7.8 vs. 6.9 mmHg/L/min/m2; p<0.001) suggesting that in these non-vasodilator responder subjects, there is a decrease in true resistance after inhaling oxygen and a further decrease with the addition of nitric oxide.120 -a  1 0 0 -8 0 -60 -0 04 0 -2 0 -5 100Cardiac Index (CT, )Figures 6.1: Shows ihe linear regression plots o f ihe paired data o f cardiac index (Cl, L min ‘ m' )^ and mean pulmonary artery pre.ssure (MPAP, mmHg) produced during exercise, o f  ihe pool data o f ihe study non-vasodilator responder subgroup.

The slope of the MPAP/CI plot on testing byANCOVA was significantly decreased from air to oxygen, and increased form the air tothe NO/O2 mixture, and oxygen to the NO/O2 mixture (Figure 6.2, Table 6 . 2  & 6.3) (8.5vs. 7.8 vs. 8.9 mmFlg/L/min/m2; p = 0.001, p= 0.044, p<0.001).However the 95% confidence intei'vals for the slopes of the air and the NO/O2 groups overlapped, which may actually suggest that there is no significant decrease in resistance in vasodilator responders.246100 -8 0 -60 —cm0 2 84 6Cardiac Lidex (CI, )F iltres  6.2: Shows the linear regression plot o f  the paired data o f cardiac index (Cl, L m in’ m' )^ and mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP, mmHg) produced during exercise, o f  the piw led data o f the study va.sodilator subgroup.

This approach is misleading in many clinical and experimental circumstances (Ahmed, T. et al 1983; Graham, R. et al 1983; Lodato.R.T et al 1985; McGregor, M. et al 1985) and does not change 'with changes in the patients clinical condition (Castelain, V. et al 2002). In both isolated lung and in vivo the MPAP/ flow relationship is rectilinear over the physiological range of flow (Castelain, V. et al 2002; Janicki, J. S. et al 1985). In young normal himians this MPAP-LAP/CO line when extrapolated towards the y axis, may cross through the origin (Ekelund, L. G. et al 1967). However disease processes or pharmacological inteiwentions can alter both the intercepts, making it either positive or negative, across the pressure axis, or to alter the slope, (Castelain, V. et al 2002; Harris, P. et al 1968; Janicki, J. S. et al 1985; Leeman, M. et al 1988; Murray, P. A. et al 1986; Naeije, R. et al 1987). When closing pressure is greater than PCWP and flow varies, the discrimination of passive (or flow dependant) and active changes to PAP cannot be determined from single PVR calculations. The correct approach would be to determine P-Q over several levels of flow (McGregor, M. et al 1985).The extrapolated intercept is felt by most to represent the mean closing pressure of the pulmonary vessels. The slope is felt to represent the average cross sectional area of the opened vessels, (Dawson, C. A. et al 1988; Mitzner, W. et al 1987).We felt it important that the techniques used in this study could be easily replicated in a normal clinical setting. However, the method of increasing cardiac output does present problems and inaccuracies in the study. Straight leg raising is a difficult exercise to250perform and many subjects were unable to complete the exercise period. Secondly, straight leg raising uses abdominal muscles, leading to increased intra abdominal and intra thoracic pressures. It was hoped that the averaging of the pressures and cardiac outputs over 16 seconds would eradicate any swing in pressures form this source. A future study, repeating the studies using a supine cycle ergometer may reduce this error.The changes in the slopes of the recto-linear plots produced on linear regression analysis of the individual inhalational studies suggest that in the subjects reported to be vasodilator ‘non-responders’, that the NO/O2 combination, far from having no effect on the pulmonary vasculature, may decrease the actual resistance or effect the distensibility and compliance of the pulmonaiy vessels, (slope of the air plot 10.1 [95% confidence interval 9.8-10.5] compared with NO/O2 slope of 6.9 [95% confidence interval 6.7- 7.0]). It was noted that 4 out of the 9 subjects in this gi’oup had CTEPH, but this fall in slope remained true, even when data from the remaining 5 subjects was pooled and analyzed separately.More surprisingly, although statistically the recto-linear plots of the ‘vasodilator responsive’ pooled subjects were all different under ANCOVA analysis, and indeed the slope of the NO/O2 plot was greater than the air plot, it was noted that visually, the air and the NO/O2 inhalational plots seemed to run parallel. Indeed the 95% confidence interval of the air and the NO/O2 groups for their individual slopes, overlapped (95% confidence interval for the slope of the air plot, 8 .2 -8 . 8  and for the NO/O2 plot, 8.6-9.1). In only the oxygen gi'oup, was the slope decreased, compared to baseline on air. What was startlingly obvious was the overlap of the intercept between the air and the oxygen group, but the reduction of the intercept in the NO/O2 group (for air, 40.4, 95%251confidence interval 39.3-41.6, for oxygen, 40.0, 95% confidence interval 39.1-40.9, and for NO/O2 30.1, 95% confidence interval 29.9-31.7). As the ANCOVA analysis of the plots suggested a change in the slopes, further analysis of the intercepts was not undertaken, but this study suggests that in ‘vasodilator responsive’ subjects, the effect of the vasodilator is to the reduce the mean opening pressure of the vessels, but to leave the resistance of the vessels intact.The method of measuring cardiac output by thoracic bioimpedance has been validated in subjects with several respiratory conditions, but the accuracy in subjects with pulmonary hypertension during exercise had not been previously investigated. This analysis (chapter 3) suggests that although the actual values of cardiac output in an individual were not as accurate when compared to the thermodilutional method, but the percentage change in cardiac output, in an individual, were statistically comparable.Another problem has been that the subjects received between 40-80 ppm of NO in the NO/ 02 mixture. It has been shown that at 20 ppm, NO exclusively affects small arterioles. At 50 ppm and above, venules and small veins may be affected. This however should not be a major problem in this patient group as the expected main site of resistance would be before the venous system (Shirai, M. et al 1996).Hypoxia during exercise in subjects with cardiorespiratoiy disease may account for the increased steepness of the air P-Q plots. A reduction in the slopes the pressure-flow plots was seen in both the non-vasodilator and vasodilator groups, when inhaling oxygen alone. It was noted that the slope of the plots with oxygen in both groups was7.8.252A further problem may be that the change to the P-Q plot is secondary to either changes in LAP, intrathoracic pressure, or lung volumes. Although no attempt was made to assess lung volumes or intrathoracic pressures, by averaging over 16s (several respiratoiy cycles) we hoped to eradicate any changes, which would be due to changes in the respiratory rate or depth. It is hoped that in the near future, thoracic bioelectrical impedance will be able to give an accurate estimation of LAP.Due to the heterogeneous nature of the subjects studied, subjects with pulmonary venous hypertension were excluded. It would be useful, if further studies were performed, to repeat this sub analysis of vasodilator responsive and non-responsive subjects, within individual disease subgroups. A separate study, looking at the effects of various concentrations of NO, with and without oxygen would also be useful.Apart from the limitations of this study, there may be several reasons, other than actual direct vasodilating effects of vasodilators, to why the NO/O2 group had a reduced P-Q slope. During exercise, the subject may become hypoxic. The addition of oxygen may reduce this effect and thus reduce hypoxic vasoconstriction. In addition, during exercise there is adrenergic stimulation. Research has previously shown in dogs that blockade of P receptors leads to a parallel shift of the P-Q plot up and a blockade leads to a parallel shift down (Murray, P. A. et al 1986). It is known that NO affects the receptors, and may be possible that some NO diffuses to nerve endings. This infiltration of nerve endings may have differing effects in our vasodilator responsive and non-responsive groups.253Finally, the point of action of the vasodilator may not necessarily be at the point of maximum resistance. It has been postulated that the change of slope reflects change in Starling resistance and that resistance is mostly upstream from the point of obstruction. Thus, the vasodilatation may all be upstream from the pathological regions of obstruction.More research is required to see if the individual variations within subjects in their slopes or intercepts of their P-Q plots correlate with patient’s morbidity, mortality or other haemodynamic or clinical values.In conclusion, giving nitric oxide and oxygen to subjects who have no vasodilatory response at rest, does have an effect on the P-Q slopes, leading to a reduction in the slope and indicates that the vasculature is still responsive to vasodilators. In vasodilator responders, the effect of nitric oxide seems to be to reduce the critical closing pressure. To our knowledge, this is the first time that these differences have been found. This demonstrates that it is important to measure P-Q plots and responses to vasodilators at baseline. Differences in the extent of response in P-Q plots may be found in the future to be responsible for differences in morbidity and mortality, or demonstrate affects of vasodilator responses.In light of the results of this study, it would have been interesting to see whether in the Castilian et al (2002) study of the effects of prostacyclin at 3 months in non-vasodilator responders, whether these subjects had a reduction in resistance with NO or prostacyclin at the commencement of the study, and whether the resistance actually altered with long term treatment with prostacyclin. Another study of interest would be to assess the254vasodilator responders, who seem to reduce their critical closing pressure, and to follow them to discover if their pressure-flow plot response changes, in non-responders, on treatment, become more like responders.255Chapter 7Postural Effects on Pressure Flow gradients measured by Micromanoineter tipped Pulmonary Artery Catheter and Thoracic Impedance Cardiac output in subjects being inyestigated for Pulmonary hypertension2567.1 IntroductionIt has been demonstrated that changes in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) as defined by the difference between mean pulmonary arteiy pressure (MPAP) and left atrial pressure (LAP) divided by cardiac output (CO), may not truly reflect any changes in the vasomotor tone of the pulmonary vasculature. The production of pressure flow plots of MPAP vs CO, leads to a more accurate way of following changes in vasomotor tone (Castelain, V. et al 2002; Llarris, P. et al 1968; Janicki, J. S. et al 1985).We have performed a series of studies looking at the usefulness of producing pressure flow plots in clinical practice of subjects being investigated for possible pulmonary hypertension (Chapters 4-6). It was the intention of this part of the study that as part of the investigations the subjects would be offered cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), whilst measuring their pressure flow gradients. The intention was to investigate whether any of the CPET measurements were related to the pressure-flow slope or the intercept and could be used as surrogates. Unfortunately, there was a poor level of consent and recruitment amongst potential subjects, hence this was not possible to perform.2577.2 Methods7.2.1. Patient group & EthicsRecruitment and Ethics are described in Chapter 2. Six patients consented, but only four were successfully studied (2 males and 2 females) (Table 7.1). In two subjects, the study was unsuccessful due to problems with the thoracic bioimpedance device. The mean age (± S.D.) of the studied subjects was 55.5 years (± 17.9), but ranged from 33 to 74. The disease groups very heterogeneous, with one normal, one with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, one with pulmonary hypertension secondary to interstitial disease and one secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Subject NumberInitialsMPAP SPAP(1DPAPiniiHg)RAP PAWP PVR(mmHg / L.min )Age Sex CO(L ,mill )Diagnosis VasodilatorResponse1 M,C 17 23 11 47 2 55 F 8.1 normal N/A21 S,0 46 79 27 8 11 74 M 5.0 CTEPH N/A31 R,McD 43 74 26 11 8 16 60 M 2.2 COPD N36 F.B 43 60 26 9 22 4.2 65 F 4.9 PVH NMeanS.D.37.315.959.027.622.58.518.815.915,07.78.36.063.526.75.12.4Table 7.1: List of individual subjects with demographics and baseline haemodynamic results7.2.2.Equipment and ExperimentsInitial haemodynamic evaluation was perfonned with the patient supine and breathing room air, according to our standard protocol as described in chapter 2.3. The inhaled gas was delivered to the patient, as described in chapter 2.5.1, and shown in Figures 2.14 a- c and Figure 4.1. The right heart catheter (Gaeltec, Dunvegan, Isle of Skye), was as described in Chapter 2.1. Cardiac output was measured non-invasively by thoracic electrical bio impedance (PhysioFlow 1, Manatee, France) as described previously258(Chapter 1.11, 2.2 and 3) (Charloux, A. et al 2000). The results were transferred to Microsoft Excel, and then processed to produce 16 second averages compatible in time with the MPAP as described in chapter 2.5.Between 12-19 sets, [mean (± S.D.) of 16,2 (± 2.9)], of paired data were measured in these subjects whilst supine, breathing air performing straight leg raising exercises (chapter 4), and between 18-40 sets of paired data [mean (± S.D.) 30.8 (± 11.0)] were taken one minute prior, and during the cardiopulmonary exercise test. The cardiopulmonary exercise test was a standard ramp test, with an estimation of incremental work sufficient to allow 6-7 minutes before maximal exercise. All subjects had almost a full resting haemodynamics performed within 24 hours of the exercise test during routine right heart catheterization with a Swan-Gantz catheter, where MPAP, Svo2, PWCP and CO were initially measured.All subjects were exercised using the “Sensormatics V-max system” (Sensormatics, Yorba Linda, CA, USA) wearing an adult face mask (Hans Rudolph, inc. 72000, Kansas City, USA).7.2.3.

DiscussionIn all but one of the subjects, as well as in the pooled result, the slope pulmonary pressure flow response supine was gieater than the slope erect. However the critical closing pressure (the slopes’ intercept) was reduced in the semi-erect position. The latter change was expected, as when a human subject is erect, the left atrial pressure, initially is lower than then the supine pressure (Reeves, J. T. et al 1988). However, in an analysis of pooled data of other studies performed by Reeves et al (1988), found that although the pulmonary artery pressure starts at a lower level when at rest semi-erect, the rate of increase thereafter (the slope of the P-Q plot or the true resistance) in young healthy subjects is actually equal in both the supine and semi-erect exercise (Reeves, J. T. et al 1988). The subjects for which the semi-erect data was analysed were not all fit and young subjects (Bevegard, S. et al 1963; Groves, B. M. et al 1987; Reeves, J. T. et al 1987). In this study, of the 4 subjects tested, the results were not as expected. A possible explanation for this is that the type of supine exercise perfonned was different to that performed in other studies (straight leg raising, as opposed to supine bicycle ergometry), and that the inhalation of air at rest in this study was through a gas delivery system. Both of these changes may have combined to increase intrathoracic pressure. If this increase in intrathoracic pressure resulted in a steady increase in alveolar pressure, the result might be a continual rise in the outflow pressure, and a continual rise in the total or mean pulmonary artery pressure.Another source of error may have been the method used to monitor cardiac output, namely the Physioflow (Manatee, France) thoracic impedance device. This however has been validated in both COPD, and normal subjects at rest and in chapter 3,268demonstrating changes in cardiac output in an individual with pulmonary hypertension adequately. Another possible explanation is the heterogeneity of the disease group, and degrees of pulmonary hypertension. The slope of the only normal subject, was as expected, but that of the other 3 subjects, with COPD, CTEPH, and PVH, varied, with the former having a more shallow slope whilst supine and the latter two subjects, having more shallow slopes whilst semi-erect.The purposes of performing this study, namely comparing the differences in slope produced with varying posture in different disease groups, and comparing the slope and intercept of these produced pressure and flow plots, with variables obtained from cardiopulmonary exercise testing, was not able to be investigated, due to the relatively low number of studies achieved. This was because this study was the final investigation of a week of clinical and research procedures in subjects who were already feeling tired and ill. It may be possible however, by removing other parts of the studies perfonned on each of these subjects, to recruit greater numbers in the future, and complete this study in the future.269Chapter 8Pressure -Flow plots:Use of Dobutamine as a Surrogate for Exercise.2708.1. IntroductionTraditionally, the main method of assessing haemodynamically the success of any treatment in subjects with pulmonary hypertension was to review the changes to pulmonary vascular resistance, mean pulmonary artery pressure, and cardiac output. This is satisfactoiy if all three components improve, but may be misleading under other circumstances. As previously discussed, an increase in cardiac output, may lead to a small passive increase in mean pulmonary artery pressure, and an apparent decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance as traditionally calculated. This would erroneously then suggest that a pharmacological agent had led to some vasodilation of the pulmonary vascular circulation, when in effect its only real effect was to increase cardiac output, (McGregor, M. et al 1985).A more soimd way of assessing the effects on the pulmonary circulation, would be to plot the pressure -flow plots of a series of paired data of mean pulmonary artery pressure and cardiac output (or index) produced by altering the flow tlii’ough the lungs (Castelain, V. et al 2002; Harris, P. et al 1968; Janicki, J. S. et al 1985).There are several possible methods to achieve this. Traditionally, extra-corporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) by-pass has been used in children in a clinical context. This is no longer in regular clinical use. Another method would be to measure the pressure and flow before and after obstructing one of the two main branches of the pulmonaiy arteries (right or left) and effectively doubling the flow through the other artery (Lategola, M. T. 1958). With regards to subjects with pulmonary hypertension, such a sudden rise in pulmonary artery pressure may be dangerous, and might have . catastrophic haemodynamic consequences.271The final two options used are to increase cardiac output from the heart, either pharmacologically or via exercise (Kafi, S. A. et ai 1998). The latter has seen numerous experimental studies in humans (Castelain, V. et al 2002; Janicki, J. S. et al 1985; Reeves, J. T. et al 1988), but as shown earlier in chapter 4, is unlikely to be useful in an individual basis for the majority of patients.Dobutamine has been used in a number of experimental animal and human studies (Ducas, J. et al 1992; Furman, W. R. et al 1982; Hyman, A. L. et al 1985; Lejeune, P. et al 1987b; Lejeune, P. et al 1987a; Light, R. B. et al 1988; Naeije, R. et al 1994; Pagnamenta, A. et al 2003). It is the intention of this study, to examine the feasibility of dobutamine as an alternative to exercise, to produce pressure flow plots in a clinical context, and to examine any differences to pressure flow plots produced by this method, and by exercise.2728.2. Method8.2.1. Patient group & EthicsThe study was approved by the ethics committee of the West Glasgow’s NHS trust, and informed consent was obtained from all the patients. Subjects were recruited from all patients attending the Scottish Pulmonary Vascular Unit (SPVU) between January 2003 and July 2003, for invasive investigations. Five consecutive patients consented (2 males and 3 females) (Table 8.1). The mean age (± S.D.) of the studied subjects was 55,2 years (± 12.6), but the age ranged from 40 to 73. One turned out to be a normal subject, three had idiopathic pulmonaiy arterial hypertension (IPAH) and one pulmonary hypertension secondaiy to connective tissue disorder (CTD). Three had more than a 20% drop in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) to nitric oxide (NO, a pulmonary vasodilator), one did not, and one was not studied. Mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) ranged from 8  mmHg to 79 mmHg, with a mean (± S.D.) of 48.6 (± 24.5) mmHg. The range, mean and 95% confidence intervals for the other measured values were, right atrial pressure, 1 to 14 mmHg, mean 7,6 (± 4.5) mmHg, pulmonary artery wedge pressme 5 to 15 mmHg with a mean of 11.0 ±4.1 mmHg and PVR, ranging from 0.5 to 20 mmHg • min* L""""^  with a mean of 9.9 ± 6 .6 .273SubjectNumberInitialsMPAP SPAP(DPAPmmHg'RAP PAWP COL . n i i n ‘PVRm n i l - I g  /  L . m i n ' )Age Sex D iagnosisVasodilatorResponse2 i ,c 8 14 2 1 14 3.7 0 40 F normal5 G,C 57 91 37 6 7 4.6 9 50 M IPAH N6 W,F 79 137 48 11 14 3.3 20 67 M IP AH Y7 B,M 63 115 23 14 15 3.7 13 73 F IPAH Y15 I,P 36 62 17 6 5 4.4 7 46 F CTD YMean 58.8 101.3 31.3 9.3 10.3 3.9 12.3 55.2S.D. 24,6 43.2 15.8 4.5 4.5 1.0 8.2 16.0Table S.

Equipment and ExperimentsInitial haemodynamic evaluation was performed with the patient supine and breathing room air, according to our standard protocol as described in chapter 2.3. The inhaled gas was delivered to the patient, as described in chapter 2.5.1, and shown in Figures 2.14 a-c and Figure 4.1. The right heart catheter (Gaeltec, Dunvegan, Isle of Skye), its insertion storage and processing are described in chapter 2.1. Cardiac output was measured non- invasively by thoracic electrical bio impedance (PhysioFlow 1, Manatee, France) as described in chapter 2 . 2  and the pulmonary pressure and cardiac output data combined as in chapter 2.5. Between 41-45 sets, [mean (± S.D.) of 43 (± 1.6), on air and with the nitric oxide oxygen combination, mean (± S.D.) 42.6 (± 0.55)] of paired of data were collected at rest (4 sets) and during the dobutamine intravenous infusion, on each subject. The infusion lasted for a maximum of 10 minutes. All subjects had almost full resting haemodynamics performed within 24 hours of the exercise test during routine right heart catheterization with a swan-gantz catheter, when MPAP, PWCP and CO were initially measured.274The exercise protocol was performed as described in chapter 2.3 The number of data plots collected for the exercise part of the study ranged between 10-16 sets, [mean (± S.D.) of 13.4 (± 2.8), on air and with the nitric oxide oxygen combination, mean (± S.D.) of 14.8 (± 1.8)]. The nitric oxide was supplied as previously described (chapter 4.2, figure 4.1).8.2.3. AnalysisAnalysis of the data obtained was performed using the SPSS 13.0 package as described in chapter 2.7.2758.3 ResultsThe results of the study, was variable in individual subjects. In the pooled data, the slope of the regression line was greatest in the study, if inhaling air (6.23 with 95% confidence intervals of 6.0-6.42). As expected, the slope of the NO/O2 pooled study40Cai diac Index (CT, L* )Figures 8.1: Shows the linear regression plot o f  all the pooled paired data o f cardiac index (Cl, 7  min^ m^) and mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP, mmHg) produced during exercise, or during a 10 minute intravefwus dobutamine infusion (of 5-10 micrograms/kg/min).

However, the slopes of the dobutamine pressure-flow lines were not as expected. The air inhalation pooled data had a slope of 4.54 (95% confidence interval of 4.47-4.62), which indicated that it had the lowest resistance of all the studies. The slope of the NO/O2 inhalation dobutamine group was 5.42 (95% confidence interval of 5.35-5.50) (Figure 8.1, Tables 8.2). Comparison of the slopes by ANCOVA analysis found that there was a significant difference between the slopes of the air studies (exercise versus dobutamine, F 290, P<0.001), the NO/O2 studies (exercise versus dobutamine, F = 38, P <0.001), and between the studies of dobutamine (air versus NO/O2 slope, F = 218, P<0.001)(Table 8.2). Other analyses were not performed.The results of the individual subjects were more variable (Figures 8.2 a-e, and Table 8.2). In four subjects, the slopes of the dobutamine infusion studies were lower than the exercise study, (Table 8.2, figures 8.2a, b, d, e) (statistically true by ANCOVA analysis in 6  out of these 8  comparisons. Table 8.3). In two subjects, 5 & 11 (Figures 8.2c & e), the pressure -  flow slope was found to be negative for the inhalation of air whilst receiving dobutamine. Conversely, in subject 5, the NO/O2 & dobutamine pressure- flow slope was significantly steeper (11.42, with a 95% confidence interval of 5.08- 17.76) compared to the other studies in that subject (Table 8.2).277SUBJECT: 2Caidiac Lidex (Cl, L ':nh& \n^)Figures 8.2a: Shows the linear regression plot of the paired data of cardiac index (Cl, L min^ m'^ ) and mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP, mmHg) produced during exercise, or during a 10 minute intravenous dobutamine infusion (of 5-10 micrograms kg/min), in subject 2.

In subjects 15 (whilst inhaling air) and 7 (whilst inhaling NO/O2) it may have actually decreased in the minute following the commencement of the dobutamine infusion, before subsequently increasing (figure 8.3). Taking the last minute of the dobutamine infusion to represent the maximal increase in Cardiac index (Cl), the mean (± S.D.) increase in, as a percentage of baseline was 137 (± 19) % for air (range 116-161) and 135 (± 14) % for NO/O2 (range 118-154). More startling, was the relatively little increase in mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP), the mean (± S.D.) for dobutamine whilst inhaling air was 106 (± 14) %, (range 90-123), and whilst inhaling NO/O2 107 (± 7) %, (range 103-115). There was no statistically difference between the percentage increases in the air and the nitric oxide/ oxygen for neither Cl nor MPAP. There was also no statistical difference between the percentage MPAP pressure increase and baseline MPAP. The response to dobutamine in the individual subjects with respect to MPAP was again variable. Subject 15 has an apparent decrease in MPAP initially in both studies, followed in the NO/O2 with a late increase. Subject 5, seemed to initially have an increase in MPAP, but later, this was followed by a decrease. Subject 4 had an early and large increase in MPAP under both studies. Subject 2 has either a steady or late increase in MPAP under both studies, and in subject 7, the MPAP seemed relatively static.

D iscussionOver the past two decades, the inadequacies of our current clinical investigation of the pulmonary circulation have become apparent. The in-vivo investigation that would give the most information with regards to the pulmonary vasculature would be investigations to determine pulmonaiy impedance. As this requires surgically implanted devices, it is difficult to determine in humans, and is impractical in a clinical context. Thus, the next level of information would be to obtain more about the non-pulsatile component of the pulmonary circulation.It has been shown that pressure-flow plots avoid the errors generated in reviewing PVR and other static haemodynamic parameters, in assessing the state of dilatation and compliance of the pulmonary vasculature. Castelain et al (2002) found that in IPAH, those patients in whom there was no improvement in conventional haemodynamic measurements 3 month after commencement of intravenous prostacyclin, showed changes in pressure-flow gradients. This, they speculated, may account for the improved exercise tolerance found in this group. As demonstrated in chapter 6 , the pressure flow response to vasodilators may be different in responders as opposed to non-responders.The majority of pressure flow plots produced in recent years in man, were produced by exercise or by the artery occlusion technique. They have investigated subjects with heart failure, ischaemic heart disease, idiopathic pulmonaiy hypertension, connective tissue disorders, pulmonary embolic disease and normals (Castelain, V. et al 2002; Janicki, J. S. et al 1985; Reeves, J. T. et al 1988). They also pooled data obtained from several subjects to obtain their conclusions. However, studies have not been performed to discover changes in individual subjects. Our study of 24 subjects who were being289investigated for pulmonary hypertension, demonstrated that for individuals, pressure- flow plots produced by exercise are impractical, due to the poor success of achieving linearity and the wide confidence intervals for slopes and intercepts. Although changes in the exercise protocol and in the cardiac output measuring system might improve this, many of the subjects had significantly reduced exercise ability and this would lead to inadequate clinical test for these individuals.Dobutamine is an ionotropic agent that has been in use since the 70's. It has combined alpha and beta adrenoreceptor activity. Alpha receptors and B receptors are found in the peripheral systemic vasculature, and it seems that at standard doses the effects of dobutamine on the systemic vasculature seems to cancel itself out. Its main effect is on the beta-1 receptors in the myocardium (Leier, C. V. et al 1983) and leads to increase myocardial contractility (Vatner, S. F. et al 1972; Vatner, S. F. et al 1974). It is often used in cardiac patients in order to increase cardiac output. With regards to the pulmonary circulation, receptors are present, but are not thought to have any clinical relevance.This study used dobutamine as an alternative mechanism for producing pressure-flow plots. As with other studies in animals using dobutamine (Pagnamenta, A. et al 2003), we found that the steepness of the slopes of the recto-linear plots produced by the use of dobutamine rather than exercise, varied significantly between subjects. However, where there was a change in slope seen after inhaling a N 0/02 combination during exercise, this was only replicated in only two of the five subjects, during the dobutamine infusion.290The differences in the slopes produced from dobutamine as compared to exercise may be due to several reasons. It may be that during exercise autonomic stimulation actually has an effect on the pulmonary circulation. There is some evidence to back this up, in that following prolonged exercise, pulmonary vascular resistance may actually fall to below pre- exercise levels (Ekelund, L. G. 1967; Reeves, J. T. et al 1988). Furthermore, during exercise the respiratory rate and flow increases six fold. This increases the alveolar pressure and the intrathoracic pressure in normal humans and results in an increase in the critical closing pressure. In some of our subjects, with underlying lung disease the effect may be exaggerated.It was interesting to note the varying effects on MPAP despite a universal increase in cardiac index (Cl). Pagnamenta et al (2003) noted that in dogs with experimentally induced pulmonaiy hypertension, at doses higher than 1 0  pg kg""""^  min'^ the effect of dobutamine on the pressure-flow curves depended on the resting tone. It may be in humans, depending on the underlying cause of pulmonary hypertension, the concentration of dobutamine required to be affective by resting tone may actually decrease. Other possible explanations for the reduction in MPAP noted, is that the dobutamine part of the study was performed 20 minutes after 3 sets of 3 minute straight leg raising exercises were perfonned (over a 33 minute period). Although the exercise was mild, in chronically ill subjects with pulmonary hypertension who are haemodynamically restricted, this exercise may have led to an alteration of basal tone, which changed during the dobutamine study. Performing the dobutamine study several hours after the exercise study may resolve this possibility.It was also noted that the Cl only increased by a third in this study. It was decided to not291exceed 10 pg kg'  ^ min'^ in this initial study for safety concerns. It would be useful to repeat this study using the routine cardiac protocol for dobutamine stress tests. This would involve increasing the dobutamine concentration in 5 pg kg""""* min""""* increments every few minutes, until the desired result, or a 40 pg kg""""* min""""* maximal threshold is achieved (Mishra, M. B. et al 1997). Mislira et al (1997) found that only 25% of subjects with possible ischaemic heart disease reached their maximal stroke volume on a 10 pg kg'* min""""* infusion of dobutamine. In the pulmonaiy hypertensive subjects, a doubling of the Cl might be appropriate.A further pressure-flow study with dobutamine should be performed looldng at the effects of dobutamine, at various concentrations, on Cl and MPAP in humans with various diseases.From the results of this current study, dobutamine, at least under the cunent protocol cannot be recommended as a method for producing pressure flow plots in humans for routine clinical evaluation. Fuither studies, into its effect on humans, with pulmonary hypertension from a variety of causes need to be performed.292Chapter 9 General Discussion2939.1 Summary of resultsAlthough this thesis has been limited by subject recruitment, and equipment failures, it has added infonnation in several areas, but also brought up several new questions that require further studies. In some of the studies we performed, it would be useful to continue collecting subjects in order to get sufficient numbers to assess statistically.9.1.1. Non invasive cardiac output measurements in subjects with pulmonary hypertensionThe gold standard measurement of cardiac output is by the Pick method. In clinical practice, the thermodilutional method is the main method of obtaining cardiac output, but its accuracy with respect to pulmonary hypertension is questionable for several reasons, and the blood flow results are not instantaneous (Cigarroa, R. G. et al 1989; Kohanna, F. H. et al 1977).The physioflow 1, (© Manatee, France), in several previous studies seemed to have a higher accuracy then other thoracic impedance systems at measuring cardiac output, and it avoided the need for measuring plasma viscosity or distance between electrodes, it also benefited from an easy calibration system (Charloux, A. et al 2000). This device was potentially useful in subjects with pulmonary hypertension, but had not been previously validated in subjects with pulmonary hypertension.Our study, the results of which are in chapter 3, demonstrate that with regards to the use of the physioflow 1 (© Manatee, France), in subjects with pulmonary hypertension, in general clinical practice, it did not produce results consistent with results produced by the thermodilutional method. The correlation with the thermodilutional results was r^  =2940.463, with a regression equation of C O pf = 1.924 + C O th erm  • 0.844 (L#min'*). Assessment by the Bland- Altman method demonstrated that the physioflow overestimated cardiac output by 1.21 (± 1.85) L#min * when comparing the values with thermodilutional values, giving a mean difference (± S.D.) of 23.35 (± 35.9) %. A similar result was obtained during exercise. An overestimation could be expected, as previous findings have found excessive thoracic fluid, leads to a drop in estimated pressures, and in subjects with COPD and pulmonary hypertension, using other impedance devices, an overestimate was noted (Bougault, V. et al 2005). There is evidence that thermodilutional results in subjects with tricuspid regurgitation (and thus pulmonary hypertension), may be an underestimation (Hoeper, M. M. et al 1999).With regards to changes of cardiac output within an individual, the physioflow was much more promising. In an analyses of 21 subjects, whilst either exercising or receiving oxygen or nitric oxide, the percentage change from baseline gave a correlation, r^  = 0.81 (p < 0 .0 0 1 ), with a regression equation of,%ACOppBaselme = 3.16 + %ACOTUERMBaseline # 0.916 (%). Assessment by the Bland Altman method found that the change was a small overestimation of 2.08 (± 12.5) %, (giving 95% confidence intervals of between -23.0 and 27.1 %). Of the 21 subjects analysed, 3 did not have pulmonary hypertension, and 9 were pulmonary arterial hypertensive (WHO group I) subjects. The study, when sub­analysed, to avoid over-representing individual subjects, found a much poorer correlation for the oxygen and the nitric oxide group. In the nitric oxide group the percentage change from baseline gave a correlation, r^  = 0.02 (p = 0.63), with a regression equation of.295%ACOpFBaseline == 4,87 + %ACOTHERMBaseline • -0.07(%).The number of subjects studied was small, and if more subjects were obtained, better results may have been obtained.Our study had several areas of weaknesses. The first was the lack of any data of reproducibility of measurements on an individual when measurements are days apart. This was due to the limitation regarding ethics, but with this device potentially being an important tool in the future, a study looking into this would be useful.Another weakness was that the method being used to compare the physioflow with was the thermodilutional technique, which in itself has been suggested to be inaccurate, especially in the context of pulmonary hypertension or severe tricuspid regurgitation. Unfortunately, echocardiogiaphic data for severe tricuspid regurgitation was only retrospectively available in 13 of the 25 individuals. The Tick technique, at least amongst the pulmonary hypertensive subjects, would be a more fair technique to make a comparison, to evaluate the physioflow’s usefulness in a clinical situation.Two other weaknesses in the study were the small number of subjects in individual disease subgroups, making an individual disease sub-analysis difficult. In the exercise comparison, straight leg raising involves the intra-abdominal muscles more than other types of exercise, and is more likely to produce a poor signal for the physioflow than other methods of increasing cardiac output.2969.1.2. Pressure flow plotsWith regards to the production of pressure-flow plots, several areas were explored. Our aim for the project was to develop an easy and repeatable way of producing such plots in individual subjects in clinical practice. In order to do this, a combination of a micro­manometer tipped pulmonary artery catheter placed in the right pulmonary artery and the use of a continuous cardiac output monitor, in the guise of the physioflow 1 thoracic impedance device was used in order to measure pulmonary artery pressure and cardiac output respectively. The first method used to change the individual subjects cardiac output was straight leg raising exercise. The first problem that arose, was the high level of equipment failure with either the catheter failing to be placed adequately, measurement recordings failing to be stored, or the failure to get adequate signals from the physioflow. The failure rate was in 20% of subjects.The second problem, as found in chapter 3, was the discrepancy in cardiac output measurements taken by the physioflow 1 and by thermodilutional methods. Although in an individual, the changes in percentage from baseline were accurate, the lack of accurate quantitation mean that the slopes and intercepts produced in an individual subject would not be able to be compared with other individuals. Another problem is that no studies have been perfonned using the physioflow I to demonstrate reproducibility within an individual with pulmonary hypertension in terms of either cardiac output or pressure flow plots, over time.With regards to the successful production of linear pressure-flow plots, 8 6  sets of paired data were produced in these studies, whilst supine and performing straight leg exercises. The results of chapter 4 found that of the 8 6  plots of paired data, all had an acceptable297scattergram, but only 56 of the 8 6  (65%) had adequate histograms of ftequency versus regression standardized residuals and plots of cumulative probability of regression standardised plots. With regards for the ANOVA test of non-linearity, only 3 failed that test, but the test could not be performed on over half the linear regression plots, giving only 39 of 8 6  lines, achieved statistical linearity. When reviewing the confidence intervals of the slopes, only 38% of the slopes and 20% of the intercepts had confidence intervals which were within 2 0 % of the linear equation slope or intercept, making comparisons of small differences in the slopes or intercepts difficult.When the data was sub-analysed, by pooling subject data into their respective disease groupings, there was very little difference in the slope between inhaled gases, except in the subjects with chronic thromboembolic hypertension (CTEPH) (and normals). Excluding the chronic thromboembolic and normal subjects, the slopes in the disease subgroups all seemed to show a parallel shift in the pressure flow plots. In the chronic thromboembolic group, there was a significant reduction in the slope from air to nitric oxide. In both the IPAH and CTEPH group, oxygen seemed to increase resistance.An unexpected but interesting finding, which may explain the differences seen in chapter 5, was that non- vasodilator responders had a reduction in the slope of the pressure flow plot when given nitric oxide and oxygen combined, whereas vasodilator responders had a shift in their critical closing pressure (intercept) rather than a fall in their resistance. It may be that the effect of a high concentration of nitric oxide led to vasodilation of the pulmonary venules, and this may somehow altered the mean closing pressure.298Our attempt to use dobutamine for the production of pressure flow plots (chapter 8) was not successful It was found that despite a gradually increasing cardiac output in all 5 subjects throughout the study, the mean pulmonary arteiy pressme either increased within the first few minutes of the study and then reached a plateau, or in the case of one subject actually decreased. Its possible that the exercise perfoimed at least 20 minutes earlier (chapter 4), resulted in an alteration of the basal tone of the pulmonary vasculature (Ekelund, L. G. 1967; Reeves, J. T. et al 1988). This may also be due to the effect of dobutamine on either the alpha or beta receptors in blood vessels in the pulmonary vasculature. In the systemic circulation, these effects on the blood vessels nonnally cancel each other out, (Leier, C. V. et al 1983) but this may not necessarily be the case in the pulmonary circulation. It had also been previously noted that the effects of dobutamine on the pulmonary vasculature in dogs, at concentrations higher than used in our study, depended on the imderlying resting tone (Pagnamenta, A. et al 2003).2999.2. Future WorkThere are several areas, in which the results of this thesis indicate future studies may be useful. With regards to the physioflow device, it would be useful to study whether a given cardiac output at rest, and changes of cardiac output from baseline, by exercise or dobutamine, are reproducible when measured within individuals, when the measurements are separated by a gap of several days. The pressure flow gradients produced, should also be repeated after several days to assess whether the results in an individual subject remains constant, which would mean the device would be able to be used to track changes in individuals.When the studies were initiated, the nitric oxide group was given additional oxygen, irrespective of whether they were hypoxic at rest. This was in order to maximise the vasodilatory effects. However, as was noted in chapter 5, oxygen inlialation in the idiopathic pulmonary hypertensive subjects, seem to increase the slope and thus vascular resistance in some patients. During these studies, a direct comparison made between nitric oxide alone and nitric oxide/oxygen combination was not performed. It was noted that in chapter 5, in the IP AH subgroup, the slope of the pressure-flow plot actually increased with oxygen, and in the CTD group increased to 6.4 with the NO/O2 combination, and 6.5 with oxygen alone. It may be the effects of oxygen on the pulmonary vasculatui'e may differ depending on whether a subject is exercising. This would be a future avenue to pursue. Furthermore, Shirai et al (1996) found that nitric oxide at concentrations of 20ppm were sufficient to dilate pulmonary arterioles. At concentrations above 40ppm, the pulmonary venules start to be affected. A study comparing various dosages of nitric oxide and its effect on pressure-flow plots in individuals would be useful. This would be particularly interesting to see if by altering300the nitric oxide concentration, the effect on critical closing pressure alters, as the pulmonary venules vasodilate and outflow pressure alters. Using the pressure decay curve following pulmonary artery occlusion (Kafi, S. A. et al 1998), might help to partition the pulmonary vascular resistance. Finally, once the reproducibility of cardiac output measurements over time in an individual with pulmonary hypertension when measured by the physioflow 1 device is established long term studies, looking for changes in the response to vasodilators in subjects treated with disease modifying drugs, may be of interest.Additionally a pilot study, using other methods of exercise, for instance a supine bicycle ergometer, is needed, to see whether the plots produced are more linear. A study comparing the effects of breathing air with or without the use nitric oxide delivery system would also be useful.The use of dobutamine in these subjects, in order to produce pressure-flow plots, needs to be further investigated and ideally on separate days to any exercise studies. Further studies, using varying dosing regimes, also need to be performed, (either steady state or incremental up to 40 pg kg“^ min""""*), to discover the optimum regime.An unpublished review of high fidelity pulmonary artery pressure data, obtained over the past several years at the Scottish Pulmonary Vascular Unit, suggest that there is a linear relationship between systolic, diastolic, mean and pulse pressure, in the sense that knowing one pressure will allow the calculations of other pressures, through several derived equations. However, with regards to pulse pressure, the equation obtained, PAPP = 1.1 + 0.79 SAPP (mmHg), had the greatest variance, giving a standard301deviation of 6.61 mmHg. A further study of unpublished data, found that pulmonary artery pulse pressure was related to survival, in all cause pulmonaiy hypertension. The 2 year survival probability was 95 % for a pulse pressure of <55mmHg, but only 60% for a pulse pressure >70mmHg. Pulse pressure differences may be a reflection of differences in compliance or distensibility of the pulmonary vasculature. This is because pulse pressure is basically affected by four components. Compliance of the vessels that the blood is flowing through, the point of wave reflection (branch points), the volume of blood passed into the vasculature (stroke volume), and the frequency of flow pulsation (heart rate). It would be hoped, but not necessarily true, that when comparing the effects of pharmacological agents on a subject, the wave reflection sites would remain static. Thus further analysis of the pulmonary artery pressure data collected via the high fidelity pulmonary artery catheters and corresponding stroke volume and heart rate data from the physioflow 1 thoracic impedance device would be useful to investigate changes in compliance in individual disease groups. This would be especially be true when looking at changes in posture and in respect of vasodilator responses to oxygen or nitric oxide. (Data chapters 5-6).All the evidence suggests that the pulsatile nature of the pulmonary circulation is important in determining the amoimt of stress placed on the right ventricle, as the hypertrophy of the right ventricle is a major contributor to death. The ideal situation would be to look at pulmonaiy vascular impedance, but in humans, under normal clinical conditions, this would be impractical. Studying the pulmonary artery pulse pressure alone and in conjunction with stroke volume or heart rate would go some way in looking at this pulsatile component to blood flow.3029.3 ConclusionsAs a consequence of these studies, we have come to several conclusions, but the study has resulted in many more questions needing to be answered. It has been known for some years, that our current haemodynamic measurements of the pulmonary circulation are inadequate. This thesis attempted to look into several aspects of pulmonary circulation in order to improve our basic clinical investigations of all subjects.The thesis relates to the validation of the non-invasive cardiac output device, the physioflow 1, and its use in the production of pressure flow plots in subjects with pulmonaiy hypertension. With regards to this, we found, at least when compared with thermodilution cardiac output, the physioflow overestimated cardiac output by IL, and had a wide confidence intervals. It did, however, follow trends in cardiac output much more readily. Thus, it may be useful experimentally with the pooling of data, but it cannot currently be a clinical substitute for invasive measurement. If further reproducibility studies are performed and found to be accurate within an individual, it may then become a method of following changes in cardiac output in an individual over a period of time.The pressure-flow response to nitric oxide, varies from ‘vasodilator’ responders and non-responders, in an unexpected manner, and may also vary between disease aetiologies. Further investigations to understand this difference, may open up novel therapeutic options.Studies in both nonnal and pulmonaiy hypertensive humans with regards to the pulmonary circulations response to dobutamine are also necessary. Understanding this may help in allowing dobutamine to be used as a surrogate for exercise.303Reference ListAnonymous (1985), Long-term domiciliary oxygen therapy, Lancet. 2, (8451), 365-367.Anonymous (2004), Proceedings o f the 3rd World Symposium on Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension.

The most common approach is to estimate pulmonary artery systolic pressure from right ventricular pressure (assuming no pulmonic stenosis) determined as the sum of the right ventricular-right atrial pressure gradient and either an assumed or clinically determined right atrial pressure.

To test this hypothesis, we investigated the influence of pat on paCO2, and then assessed the influence of paCO2 on ICP by extrapolating data found in the literature.

Incremental resistance was computed as the slope of the P-Q degree relation, whereas critical closure was referred to as the extrapolated pressure intercept at zero flow. P-Q degree coordinates were obtained by varying Q degree through graded inflation of right atrial balloon. The gradients across the arterial segment (Pa = Ppa - Pc) and across the venous segment (Pv = Pc - Pw) of the pulmonary vasculature were defined by the computation of effective capillary pressure (Pc) obtained from the analysis of the transient decay of pulmonary artery pressure (Ppa) toward wedge pressure (Pw) after arterial occlusion. Six group E dogs were infused with endotoxin at a rate of 0.25 microgram/kg min, while six additional animals served as control (group C). Endotoxin induced increases in flow resistance from 0.056 to 0.096 mm Hg/ml/min/kg due to arterial vasoconstriction and increases in critical closure from 2.3 to 8.4 mm Hg due to a venous waterfall. Before and after endotoxin insult, we assessed effects of each of three levels of static lung inflation (PEEP) on P-Q degree relationships.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS",,"journal article, http://purl.org/coar/resource_type/c_6501, info:eu-repo/semantics/article","Human health sciences, General & internal medicine, Sciences de la santé humaine, Médecine générale & interne",,

This finding is analysed in the context of present understanding of propulsion of red blood cells (RBCs) and plasma by means of the arteriovenous pressure gradient. Interfacial forces between the red blood cells and the plasma are proposed as a rational explanation of the observed red blood cell velocities. While the arteriovenous pressure gradient across the capillaries propels the red blood cell and the plasma jointly, interfacial forces along the red blood cell membrane can propel RBCs at the cost of the plasma. Different options are explored for the physical origin of these interfacial forces and oxygen gradients are found to be the most probable source.</p",,bookPart,"Arterioles, Biomechanical Phenomena, Blood Flow Velocity, Blood Pressure, Capillaries/physiology, Cell Membrane, Erythrocytes, Hematocrit, Humans, Plasma",,Springer

An overall population-specific rule linking specific model parameters to increases in PEEP is formulated to predict the hemodynamic effects on arterial pressure, pulmonary artery pressure and stroke volume. Hemodynamic changes are predicted for an increase from 0 to 10cmH₂O with median absolute percentage errors less than 7% (systolic pressures) and 13% (stroke volume). For an increase from 10 to 20cmH₂O median absolute percentage errors are less than 11% (systolic pressures) and 17% (stroke volume). These results validate the general applicability of such a rule, which is not pig-specific, but holds over for all analyzed pigs.

Peterson,2016,"The theory of dynamic fluid motion involving the forces manifested by mass, acceleration, viscous friction and vessel wall tension have been considered and studied when arterial blood flow and pres-sure are pulsatile. These studies and considerations have resulted in the conclusion that arterial blood pressure is dependent upon all of these parameters and that the relationship of pressure and flow is more complex and nonlinear than heretofore generally believed. IT is generally held that Poisueille&apos;s lawadequately describes the relationships ofarterial blood pressure and flow. The basic assumptions underlying his law are that there is steady, laminar, parallel, flow of a New-tonion liquid in a straight, smooth walled tube. The arterial blood circulation is pulsatile, the fluid is non-Newtonion and the vessels are of complex geometry and elasticity. Consideration of these discrepancies between idealized and actual conditions leads one to question the usual approach to hemodynamics which linearly relates flow and pressure, and which designates arterial distensibility and vol-ume change as the primary determinants of pulse pressure. In addition to vessel distensibility two other effects must be considered in the case of arte-rial blood flow which accelerates and decel-erates. These are inertia and viscosity which are generally related in a complex manner to distensibility.

M., Fossion, Anny, Marcelle, Roland",1993,"The purpose of the present work was to explore the hypothesis that pulmonary vasoconstriction secondary to endotoxin insult results mainly from an increase in the critical closing pressure of the pulmonary vessels. Specifically, we reasoned that in the face of a Starling resistor located between pulmonary arteries and left atrium, upstream transmission of increased left atrial pressure (Pla) would be inversely related to the level of the pressure intercept (Pi) obtained by extrapolation from the linear pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa)--flow (Q degrees) plot. Six dogs (group E) were infused with Escherichia coli endotoxin (0.25 microgram/kg/min) for 2 hr, whereas six additional dogs (group C) served as control. During baseline conditions, Pi approximated LAP in both groups. In group C dogs, increasing LAP at constant Q degrees led to a proportional augmentation of Ppa. In group E dogs, endotoxin resulted in a shift of the Ppa-Q relationships to higher pressures due to both increases in Pi and slope. In addition, changes in Pla over the same range as in control dogs affected Ppa only at the highest levels of Pla. We conclude that endotoxin insult increases the critical closing pressure that exceeds Pla and induces the occurrence of a Starling resistor responsible for the production of an effective vascular waterfall",,"journal article, http://purl.org/coar/resource_type/c_6501, info:eu-repo/semantics/article","Human health sciences, General & internal medicine, Sciences de la santé humaine, Médecine générale & interne",,Wiley Liss

The major hypothesis was that connecting number names and the structure of the number system would help children better underst and the number system and use this underst and ing with transfer tasks. Two treatments were used, Counting by Tens and Counting by Ones. Counting by Tens used objects grouped by tens for counting, while the Counting by Ones used single objects which were connected by one. Study 1 had 60 kindergarteners from a rural community and Study 2 had 80 first graders from a middle class suburban system. Study 1 traced tendencies for achievement of Counting by Tens with long term effects and Study 2 compared the effects of the two treatments. The studies used a pretest-posttest-retention test design. Counting abilities, number concepts, and transfer tasks were assessed to measure the effects of treatments. Both Counting by Tens and Counting by Ones appear to be equally effective for counting abilities and number concepts and show similar results throughout. Counting by Tens was favored on transfer tasks, place value, addition and subtraction with two-digit numerals and word problems with two-digit numbers. Counting by Tens was effective on most tasks, while the Counting by Ones treatment was effective only on counting tasks and number concepts. Counting by Tens was beneficial for both high and low ability children on transfer tasks. Greater gains from the Counting by Tens treatment were maintained throughout the six months from posttest to delayed retention test in Study 1. The findings show that a Counting by Tens treatment which emphasizes the connection between number names and the structure of number system can serve broadly as a basis for mathematics learning in early school years.Doctor of Education (EdD)Curriculum developmentEarly childhood educationMathematics educationUniversity of Michiganhttp://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/161893/1/8821538.pd",,Thesis,Education,,

Secondly, I show the intelligibility of Kripke’s sceptical paradox expounded in Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language and claim that it would be a genuine problem to any theory of meaning. Then I argue that the sceptical paradox can be avoided by the proposed distinction. Thirdly, I show that if we adopt the semantic normativity, then the paradox seems unavoidable. But the paradox could be dealt with if we choose to embrace an alternative conception of normativity, which is intersubjective in character.

Syftet är också att undersöka om uppgifternas utformning har betydelse för elevernas lösningsförmåga. För att få svar på detta användes ett matematiktest där eleverna fick lösa tio subtraktionsuppgifter med olika utformning, samt redovisa sina beräkningar. I undersökningen framkommer att eleverna inte anpassar sina beräkningsstrategier utifrån uppgiftens utformning, bland annat när det gäller om uppgiften är med tiotalsövergång eller utan tiotalsövergång. Vidare framgår att stegvisa beräkningar är den mest effektiva beräkningsstrategin, men att den förekommer i lägst utsträckning. Talsortsvisa beräkningar leder ofta till felaktigheter i uppgifter med tiotalsövergång, men även i uppgifter utan tiotalsövergång. Undersökningen visar också att uppgifternas utformning påverkar elevernas lösningsförmåga och att störst svårigheter har eleverna när det gäller att lösa en naken uppgift med tiotalsövergång, där minuenden saknas.The objective of the study is to investigate whether children in year 3 adapt their calculation strategies on how the subtraction tasks are designed and to determine whether certain calculation strategies are better than others. Added to this, the study looks into whether the way the tasks are designed influences the children´s ability to find the solution. The study makes use of a maths test in which the children are required to solve ten differently designed subtraction tasks and to show how they come to the answer. The study shows that the children did not adapt their calculation strategies in accordance with the way the task is designed, for instance whether the task involves a tens transitions or not. It is seen that incremental calculation is the most effective strategy but also the one least frequently used. Partial sums often result in errors when tens transitions are involved but also with tasks without tens transitions. The study also shows that way in which the tasks are designed does affect the children´s ability to find the solution and that difficulties mostly arise when children are required to solve a naked task with tens transitions, where the minuend is absent",,"Student thesis, info:eu-repo/semantics/bachelorThesis, text","subtraction, calculation strategies, task design, solution ability, subtraktion, beräkningsstrategier, uppgifters utformning, lösningsförmåga",,"Karlstads universitet, Institutionen för språk, litteratur och interkultur"

Setelah itu jumlah sel - sel tubuh akan sedikit demi sedikit mulai menyusut. Akibatnya, penurunan fungsi pada tubuh secara perlahan tidak dapat dihindari. Hal ini disebut proses degeneratif (Maryam, 2008). Usaha untuk meningkatkan kesejahteraan sosial usia lanjut dalam pasal 4 dan 5 dijelaskan PP Nomer 43 tahun 2004 bahwa pelayanan kesehatan menjadi usaha meningkatkan kesejahteraan sosial untuk usia lanjut baik yang masih potensial atau tidak. Semakin bertambah usia, tubuh akan mengalami banyak permasalahan kesehatan(Altman et al., 1986). Osteoarthritis menjadi suatu proses menua yang menyebabkan keterbatasan pada orang dewasa.Negara tetangga kita, Australia kasus meningkat sesuai bertambahnya usia, usia di atas 25 tahun mencapai 13,9% dan usia lebih dari 65 tahun mencapai 33,6 % (El-Tawil et al., 2016). Urutan dua teratas adalah negara yang epidemiologi OA ditempati China dan India. Kisaran 5.650 dan 8.145 jiwa mengeluhkan OA lutut (Felson, 2006). Menurut survey Data Riset Kesehatan Dasar tahun 2013 pada usia diatas 15 tahun penderita penyakit sendi atau rematik 24,7%. Provinsi NTT menjadi provinsi dengan prevalensi Osteoarthritis tertinggi yaitu 33,1% dan Riau yang terendah dengan sekitar 9%, di Jawa Timur diatas 25%. Kurang lebih 32,99% warga Indonesia yang telah lanjut usia mengeluhkan asam urat, rematik/radang sendi, hipertensi, hipertensi, dan diabet. 56,7% pasien di RSUPN Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Jakarta pasien menderita OA (Soeryadi et al., 2017). Gejala OA lutut pada perempuan lebih tinggi daripada laki laki. Dengan 13% wanita serta 10% laki-laki. Osteoarthritis adalah salah satu contoh utama dari degenerasi yang mana mengakibatkan terbatasnya fungsional pada lansia. Hal itu disebabkan osteoarthritis berhubungan dengan malfungsi sendi juga otot serta berdampak pada keseimbangan serta cara jalan (Wageck et al., 2016).Berbagai masalah yang muncul menyebabkan penurunan aktivitas fungsional. Aktivitas fungsional sendiri merupakan kemampuan fungsional dalam melakukan berbagai kegiatan sehari-hari. Adanya nyeri merupakan penyebab utama penuruanan aktifitas fungsional pada penderita OA. Nyeri pada OA lutut berlangsung perlahan, nyeri timbul ketika melakukan aktivitas, saat istirahat nyeri akan hilang. Menurut (Fransen et al., 2015) dan (Cross et al., 2014), permasalahan yang timbul dari osteoarthritis sendi lutut yaitu nyeri di daerah lutut, keterbatasan gerak pada sendi lutut, dan kelemahan otot di daerah sendi lutut, adanya kekakuan sendi, krepitasi dan joint tenderness, bengkak, serta adanya keterbatasan fungsional yaitu saat melakukan aktivitas berdiri ke duduk, berjalan 15 meter serta naik turun anak tangga.Apabila tidak mendapat penanganan lebih lanjut akan mengakibatkan berbagai komplikasi seperti perubahan sendi yang irreversible, dan membuat terbentuknya nodus yang pada akhirnya berwarna merah, nyri dan kemudian bengkak, terkadang disertai matirasa, subluksasi sendi, kontraktur dan lebih parah dapat menimbulkan penurunan aktivitas fungsional (Kholisotin et al., 2021). Fisioterapi berperan penting dalam penanganan masalah yang ditimbulkan oleh Osteoarthritis. Pemberian intervensi untuk osteoarthritis salah satunya memberikan physical agent atau terapi latihan. Penelitian kami berfokus kepada pemberian intervensi isometric exercise juga pemberian modalitas TENS. Isometric exercise merupakan gerakan yang diperuntukkan kelainan struktur sendi dan perubahan kekuatan otot quadriceps. Exercise ini menguatkan otot-otot dengan gerakan dan menarik beban, dilakukan selama 5 detik dengan 5 sampai 10 kali pengulangan, diutamakan untuk penguatan otot paha. TENS merupakan terapi nonfarmakologi yang relatif murah dan aman. Efek modulasi rasa sakit dari TENS ditujukan untuk komponen perifer yang dapat diatur dengan mekanisme sentral. Efek penghambatan TENS didasarkan pada ‘Teori Gate Kontrol’ dari persepsi nyeri seperti yang dijelaskan oleh Melzack dan Wall. Teori ini menunjukkan bahwa stimulasi saraf aferen (A-beta) dapat mengaktifkan penghambatan interneuron di dorsal medula. Ini dapat melemahkan transmisi sinyal nociceptive dari A-delta dan C-fiber yang berdiameter kecilMETODEPenelitian yang dilakukan menggunakan jenis eksperimen dengan menggunakan “One Group Pretest and Posttest” karena cuma ada satu kelompok yang diambil sebagai subjek penelitian tanpa adanya pembandingan dengan kelompok yang lain. Dalam penelitian ini kelompok subjek penelitian diberikan Isometric exercise dan TENS. Frekuensi 2 kali seminggu selama 4 minggu. Rancangan penelitian seperti berikut.

Gambaran Umum RespondenPenelitian ini merupakan penelitian dengan metode pre and post test group untuk mengetahui adanya pengaruh pemberian isometric exercise dan intervensi TENS terhadap peningkatan aktivitas fungsional pada pasien osteoarthritis lutut di Planet Physio Kediri. Karateristik responden yang didapat sejumlah 15 orang dengan jenis laki laki sebanyak 6 orang dan perempuan sebanyak 9 orang. Dengan rentang usia 53 tahun sampai 69 tahun. Dan  paling banyak ditemukan adalah responden yang berusia 63 tahun sejumlah 4 orang. Faktor resiko yang tidak bisa pengaruhi adalah usia, ras, jenis kelamin dan gen.101Jurnal Keperawatan Muhammadiyah 7 (1) 20222. Hasil Kemampuan Aktivitas FungsionalPemeriksaan kemampuan fungsional bagi kondisi Osteoarthtritis adalah menggunakan WOMAC. Skala ini khusus untuk menilai kemampuan aktivitas fungsional pada kondisi osteoarthritis lutut.Dari hasil yang didapat menggunakan skala WOMAC, didapatkan hasil Pre Minimum 32 dan Pre Maksimum sebesar 81. Dan post test. Post Minimum sebesar 27 dan post maksimum 57,29. Sedangkan std. Deviasi setelah diukur menggunakan Wilcoxon didapat hasil pre dan post sebesar (pre 15,68 dan post 14,66) dan didapat selisih 1,2.Efek modulasi rasa sakit dari TENS ditujukan untuk komponen perifer yang dapat diatur dengan mekanisme sentral. Efek penghambatan TENS didasarkan pada ‘Teori Gate Kontrol’ dari persepsi nyeri seperti yang dijelaskan oleh Melzack dan Wall. Teori ini menunjukkan bahwa stimulasi saraf aferen (A-beta) dapat mengaktifkan penghambatan interneuron di dorsal medula. Ini dapat melemahkan transmisi sinyal nociceptive dari A-delta dan C-fiber yang berdiameter kecil. Sehingga nyeri dapat terasa berkurang. Sedangkan Isometric exercise merupakan latihan latihan yang dipergunakan untuk kelainan struktur sendi dan perubahan kekuatan otot quadriceps. Exercise ini menguatkan otot-otot dengan gerakan dan menarik beban, dilakukan selama 5 detik dengan 5 sampai 10 kali pengulangan, diutamakan untuk penguatan otot paha. Efek dari latihan ini dapat memperbaiki kekuatan otot yang lemah Sehingga dapat meningkatkan aktivitas fungsional pada penderita Osteoarthritis lutut. Efek biologis TENS sebagai penurun rasa nyeri dan efek dari latihan isometrik yang dapat memperkuat otot yang lemah dapat menjadi kombinasi yang bertujuan untuk memperbaiki aktivitas fungsional pada penderita Osteoarthritis lutut. KESIMPULANIsometric exercise dan modalitas TENS dapat diberikan kepada pasien yang menderita Osteoarthritis lutut dan menunjukan hasil yang baik dalam meningkatkan aktivitas fungsional. Sehingga mendapatkan kualitas hidup yang lebih baik. SARANSebaiknya Isometric Exercise dan modalitas TENS diberikan kepada penderita Osteoarthritis lutut sehingga aktivitas fungsionalnya bisa ditingkatkan dan mendapatkan kualitas hidup yang lebih baik.DAFTAR PUSTAKAAltman, R., Asch, E., Bloch, D., Bole, G., Borenstein, D., Brandt, K., Christy, W., Cooke, T.

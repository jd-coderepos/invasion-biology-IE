Where biological invasions have occurred, however, invasive alien species should have negative effects on indigenous faunal assemblages. To assess these predictions, we provide the first systematic ecological survey of the Collembola assemblages of pristine, sub-Antarctic Heard Island (53.1°S, 73.5°E) and compare the results to similarly conducted surveys of three other sub-Antarctic islands (Marion, Prince Edward, and Macquarie), characterised by assemblages including invasive Collembola. In particular, we examine differences in densities of three indigenous species (Cryptopygus antarcticus, Mucrosomia caeca, Tullbergia bisetosa) shared between the invaded islands and Heard Island. On average, density of these species was four or more-fold significantly lower on the invaded islands than on uninvaded Heard Island. Yet mean assemblage densities of springtails, accounting for variation among vegetation communities, did not differ substantially or significantly among the islands, suggesting that compensatory dynamics may be a feature of these systems. The invasion impact prediction of the ACDI is therefore supported. On Heard Island, indigenous assemblage variation is strongly related to vegetation community and less so to elevation, in keeping with investigations of Collembola assemblage variation elsewhere across the Antarctic. These findings, in the context of field experimental and physiological data on Collembola from the region, suggest that the climate-diversity predictions of the ACDI will play out in different ways across the Antarctic, depending on whether precipitation increases or decreases as climates change",,text,"Antarctica, Invasion impacts, Neutral theory, Springtail, Turnover",,'Elsevier BV'
Antarctic climate-diversity-invasion hypothesis,484099662,Invaders in waiting? Non-equilibrium in Southern Hemisphere seaweed distributions may lead to underestimation of Antarctic invasion potential,,"Laeseke, Philipp, Martínez, Brezo, Mansilla, Andrés, Bischof, Kai",2021,"Bioinvasions pose a major threat to global biodiversity. Correlative Ecological Niche Models (ENMs) can be a valuable tool to identify invaders and invasion sites. However, in cases when species are in non-equilibrium with their native environment (i.e. do not fill their niche), correlative approaches have limited power and invasions lead to shifts of the realized niche. In recent years, several new seaweed species have been reported in Antarctica. It is impossible to unequivocally identify which of these species are truly non-natives, however, here, we provide literature-based evidence that seaweed species have been introduced to Antarctica. Under this assumption, we reconstruct pre- and post-introduction niches of these species, calculate relative niche sizes and overlap between pre-Antarctic and Antarctic sites, and evaluate increase in niche size due to inclusion of Antarctic habitats. In seven species, the absolute occupied temperature range is dramatically enlarged, with minimum sea surface temperature (SST) being 2-5°C lower than in the pre-Antarctic ranges. In all species except one, summer SST is 5-20°C lower than in the pre-Antarctic ranges. As a result, several species’ niches increase dramatically. We hypothesize that species from the Southern Hemisphere do not cover their whole abiotically suitable range due to lack of settling substrate in cold-water regions while species from the Northern Hemisphere tend to fill their niches to a greater degree due to higher connectivity between tropic and polar regions along coastlines. Thus, while correlative ENMs for Northern Hemisphere species will probably be successful in predicting Antarctica as a suitable habitat, such models will likely be insufficient to do so for Southern Hemisphere species. From a precautionary standpoint, we argue that not only species from climatically matching regions pose an invasion threat for Antarctica, but that also species from other, climatically non-matching regions, might be potential invaders. In light of higher connectivity of the Antarctic continent with other continents this finding significantly increases invasion risk for Antarctica",,article,"barrier, bioinvasions, ecological niche modelling, intertidal, marine, niche shifts, polar, South Shetland Islands, species distribution modelling",,"eScholarship, University of California"
Antarctic climate-diversity-invasion hypothesis,250199036,Barriers to globally invasive species are weakening across the Antarctic,10.1111/ddi.12593,"Duffy, Grant A, Coetzee, Bernard W T, Latombe, Guillaume, Akerman, Alexander H., McGeoch, Melodie A., Chown, Steven L.",2017,"Aim: Biological invasions are a substantial threat to Antarctic biodiversity and a priority conservation policy focus for Antarctic Treaty Parties and the sovereign states of surrounding islands. Key to their strategies is prevention, including assessment of establishment risk for alien species. Despite establishment of some of the worst globally invasive species across the Antarctic region, assessments of establishment potential of these species are non-existent. Here, we address this deficit and determine whether these invasive species constitute a significant conservation threat to the broader Antarctic region both now and in response to future regional climate change. Location: Antarctica and the Southern Ocean islands (45°–90° S). Methods: We used ensemble species distribution models to assess the current and future climate suitability of the Antarctic region for 69 of the worst globally invasive species and 24 insect and plant species that have already established somewhere in the region. Results: The Antarctic continent is unsuitable for all of the worst globally invasive species under current conditions, but areas of the Antarctic Peninsula are predicted to become climatically suitable for up to six globally invasive species within the next century. By contrast, all Southern Ocean islands are presently climatically suitable for additional non-native species, with the threat increasing in the future. Main conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that climate, which is often cited as a key barrier to alien species establishment, may afford some protection to continental Antarctica, but that this protection is not currently extended to the Southern Ocean islands. Furthermore, existing climatic barriers to alien species establishment will weaken as warming continues across the region. This not only illustrates the value of applying distribution modelling methods to this largely ice-covered region, but demonstrates how these methods can be used to inform targeted surveillance of introduction pathways and sites that have the highest risk of establishment of invasive alien species.</p",,article,"Alien species, Biological invasions, Environmental niche, Sub-Antarctic island, Invasive species risk-assessment, species distribution modelling",,

To date, examples include a small number of vascular plants and a greater diversity of invertebrates (including Diptera, Collembola, Acari and Oligochaeta), which share features of pre-adaptation to the environmental stresses experienced in Antarctica. In this synthesis, we examine multiple classic invasion science hypotheses that are widely considered to have relevance in invasion ecology and assess their utility in understanding the different invasion histories so far documented in the continent. All of these existing hypotheses appear relevant to some degree in explaining invasion processes in Antarctica. They are also relevant in understanding failed invasions and identifying barriers to invasion.

With rapid climate change occurring in some parts of Antarctica, elevated numbers of introductions and enhanced success of colonization by aliens are likely, with consequent increases in impacts on ecosystems.

Non-native marine species will interact with other anthropogenic stressors affecting Antarctic ecosystems, such as climate change (warming, ocean acidification) and pollution, with irreversible ramifications for biodiversity and ecosystem services. We review current knowledge of non-native marine species in the Antarctic region, the physical and physiological factors that resist establishment of non-native marine species, changes to resistance under climate change, the role of legislation in limiting marine introductions, and the effect of increasing human activity on vectors and pathways of introduction. Evidence of non-native marine species is limited: just four marine non-native and one cryptogenic species that were likely introduced anthropogenically have been reported freely living in Antarctic or sub-Antarctic waters, but no established populations have been reported; an additional six species have been observed in pathways to Antarctica that are potentially at risk of becoming invasive. We present estimates of the intensity of ship activity across fishing, tourism and research sectors: there may be approximately 180 vessels and 500+ voyages in Antarctic waters annually. However, these estimates are necessarily speculative because relevant data are scarce.

These two species exhibit contrasting introduction histories and reproductive strategies and represent two referential case studies of biological invasion processes. We used a multistep process with a range of species distribution modelling techniques (ecological niche factor analysis, multidimensional envelopes, distance/entropy algorithms) together with a suite of thermoclimatic variables, to characterize the potential ranges of these species. Their native bioclimatic thermal envelopes in Eurasia, together with the different naturalized populations across continents, were compared next. The potential niche of P. pratensis was wider at the cold extremes; however, P. annua life history attributes enable it to be a more successful colonizer. We observe that particularly cold summers are a key aspect of the unique Antarctic environment. In consequence, ruderals such as P. annua can quickly expand under such harsh conditions, whereas the more stress-tolerant P. pratensis endures and persist through steady growth. Compiled data on human pressure at the Antarctic Peninsula allowed us to provide site-specific biosecurity risk indicators. We conclude that several areas across the region are vulnerable to invasions from these and other similar species. This can only be visualized in species distribution models (SDMs) when accounting for founder populations that reveal nonanalogous conditions. Results reinforce the need for strict management practices to minimize introductions.

So far, Antarctic biodiversity has been little affected by non-native species introductions owing to: (i) the late arrival of humans on the continent (c. 1820); (ii) the overall low intensity of human activity relative to other continents; and (iii) the concentration of most of that activity around a relatively limited number of research stations and tourist sites, particularly on and near to the Antarctic Peninsula and in the McMurdo region of Victoria Land. However, human activity is increasing, and Antarctica is increasingly vulnerable to both the human-mediated importation of non-native species and the redistribution of indigenous Antarctic species between biologically distinct areas within the continent. The Antarctic Peninsula warmed rapidly during the second half of the 20th century, and parts of the Antarctic continent are now starting to warm, with more widespread and substantial change expected over the next century. Consequently, terrestrial communities are increasingly vulnerable as climate change increases the risk of non-native species establishment and dispersal.

The intensification of human activity in this zone generates an array of environmental changes that increase the probability of bio-logical invasions (e.g., Frenot et al. 2005; Chwedorzewska 2009; Convey 2010).In the last few years, numerous papers have focused on understanding the mechanisms and predicting the processes of biological invasions. Among other things, they discuss the traits of the invasive species likely to successfully expand in a new ecosystem (e.g., Kleunen et al. 2010; Moles et al. 2008), predict the effects of climate change (Gilman et al. 2010), or search for links between ecological and evolutional changes (Facon et al. 2006). These theoretic and conceptual works are also intended to be applicable for developing management (research and conservation) programs, and their theoretical frameworks are “tools to organize research and evaluate the state of a subject area” (Foxcroft et al. 2011; McGeoch et  al. 2015; Thomsen et  al. 2011). Many models and frameworks, either of a broad nature (e.g., Blackburn et al. 2011; Gilman et al. 2010; Moles et al. 2008; Thomsen et  al. 2011), or describing specific species and/or regions (e.g., Facon et  al. 2006; Fox-croft et al. 2011; McGeoch et al. 2015) have been proposed by their authors as appropriate for the analysis of other invasions. However, to our knowledge such use has seldom been reported in the literature (Vardien et al. 2012).Out of these numerous works, “Expanding the conceptual frameworks of plant invasion ecology” (Foxcroft et al. 2011) deserves special attention as this work aims at “identify-ing the internal features of the receiving site and the nature of the potential invaders”. The framework had been applied to describe two plant species invasions in South Africa region (Foxcroft et al. 2011; Vardien et al. 2012). In order to evaluate if the application of an exist-ing framework in a new context is possible, we assessed the threat of biological invasions in the Maritime Antarctic using the framework of Foxcroft et al. (2011). We do not address a one region to one species relation, but analyze external factors that contributed to the susceptibility of the Maritime Antarctic region to invasions. The novelty in our work lies in evaluating whether such a framework can be used to analyze different invasion scenarios in a different context and with multiple species.MethodsWe analyzed literature on species alien to continental and Maritime Antarctica noted in the vicinity of the H. Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station situated on the western shore of Admiralty Bay on King George Island (hereinafter KGI), South Shetland archipel-ago, West Antarctica; 62°10′S, 58°28′W. The Arctowski Station lies within the Point Thomas Oasis. This is one of the largest seasonally ice-free areas (approx. 25  km2, Biodivers Conserv 1 3Lityńska-Zając et al. 2012) in the Maritime Antarctic region with relatively high tem-peratures during the austral summer (Galera et al. 2015; Kejna et al. 2013) and a con-stant flow of fresh water (Nędzarek et al. 2014) throughout most of the summer season from December to February, inclusive (Kejna et  al. 2013, Braun et  al. 2017, Sancho et al. 2017). It is also one of the most environmentally favorable areas in the Maritime Antarctic (Lityńska-Zając et al. 2012), therefore the most likely location in the whole region for biological invasions. The spatial isolation of this area and well documented logistics of the Polish Antarctic Station located there enabled a detailed assessment of the key driving factors for the probability of a successful invasion in the whole region. Environmental changes on KGI are an example of complicated processes taking place in the Maritime Antarctic region. We compared the reported incidents of alien species appearance with similar problems from other parts of the world, especially on spatially isolated islands.Our work has been arranged according to the expanded framework by Foxcroft et al. (2011) taking into account three groups of contributing factors: habitat susceptibility (invasibility of the habitat), system context (spatially explicit connectivity between the systems supplying and/or transporting potential invaders and habitat susceptibility to alien organisms), and species invasiveness (traits that predispose a species to be inva-sive). We considered the probability of biological invasions in Maritime Antarctic with detailed analysis of habitat susceptibility and system context. We do not concentrate on species invasiveness, as we analyze the threat of future invasions not knowing prop-agules of which species will arrive in the studied region. The sequence of ‘specific mechanisms’ in the Fig. 1 corresponds to the order of sub-chapters in our work.Habitat invasibility System context Species invasivenessSpecific mechanisms:•Geographical barrier – strong spatial isolation•Potential bioclimatic suitability – harsh climatic conditions•Resource availability – spatial and temporal diversity of trophic conditions•Native biodiversity – low richness of autochthonous species•Enemy release – low pressure of terrestrial consumers•Patchiness of habitat and open gaps– mosaic of microhabitats and low competitionSpecific mechanisms:•Migration pathways – limited transport capability•Functional connectivity – factors enabling the survival of alien propagules during transport•Propagule pressure – diversity of propagules reaching target region•Spatial and temporal patterns of propagule arrival – potential invasion hotspots associated with human occupied sites•Global change – rapid climate change•Residence time – low probability of survival through the lag phaseSpecific mechanisms:High plasticity, high resistance of propagules to harsh transport and habitat conditions, other mechanisms dependenton the invader speciesMain groups of contributing factors:Composite problem: What affects the probability of biological invasions in Antarctica?Fig. 1  A framework for the assessment of probability of biological invasions in Antarctica showing factors affecting the likelihood of an invasion. The diagram structure refers to Foxcroft et al. (2011) and Vardien et al. (2012) (slightly changed) Biodivers Conserv1 3Invasibility of the habitatIt is generally acknowledged that islands are more susceptible to invasion than continen-tal habitats due to prolonged isolation, low competitive capability of the native species, and empty ecological niches (Alpert et al. 2000; Brandes 2008; Trueman et al. 2010). This phe-nomenon has been studied extensively in tropical oceanic islands (Daehler 2006; Kueffer et al. 2010). On the other hand, a small island well isolated by geographic barriers, for example by specific ocean and air currents, may receive very limited propagule pressure, making it resist-ant to invasion due to its remoteness. Therefore, an invasion of an open habitat containing resources for the invader is not possible without the existence of dispersal corridors (Grime 2001).Discrepancies between reports indicate that the relation between the degree of island isola-tion and target habitat invasibility is not a simple one and in every instance can be governed by different factors (e.g., Daehler 2006; Kueffer et al. 2010; Von Holle and Simberloff 2005). Frenot et al. (2005) stated that cold islands are less susceptible to invasions than warm ones. For insects a similar relationship holds, although indigenous vascular plant richness is also an important correlate of the richness of alien insects. Investigations by Chown et al. (1998) sug-gested that larger Southern Ocean islands attract more human occupants, increasing the risk of alien organism transfer, while milder climate increases the chance of propagule establishment.Geographical barrier—strong spatial isolation of Point Thomas OasisThe Antarctic terrestrial and marine ecosystems are strongly isolated, without any gradual connectivity with those at lower latitudes. The isolation process commenced with the breakup of Gondwana and was maintained by the atmospheric Polar Vortex and oceanic Polar Frontal Zone (e.g., Barnes et al. 2006; Clarke et al. 2005; Convey 2010). Oceanic and atmospheric circulation patterns around the Antarctic significantly restrict the transfer of organisms into this region. Terrestrial ecosystems have developed on the ice-free “environmental islands” restricted to the coastal zones of the Antarctic Peninsula and the associated islands (e.g., Con-vey 2010; Houghton et al. 2016; Hughes and Convey 2010).One of such “island-like” enclaves is the Point Thomas Oasis on KGI, located approxi-mately 160 km from the Antarctic Peninsula (Zwolicki et  al. 2015). Although the distance from KGI to the nearest continent is relatively short in comparison with other oceanic islands (Kueffer et al. 2010), the nearest continent is Antarctica which is a marginal source of prop-agules. Therefore, the studied ice-free oasis is one of the most isolated areas on Earth, being separated from other terrestrial communities on the island by permanently glaciated zones (90% of KGI is ice covered year-round; Kejna et al. 2013; Zwolicki et al. 2015). There are over a dozen research stations and refuges located on KGI. Land transport between the sta-tions is highly restricted or non-existent, apart from the U.S.A. Copacabana Field Camp sum-mer station which is situated within walking distance of Arctowski Station (Kejna et al. 2013; Pudełko 2007). Travel between the other stations in the different polar oases is accomplished mainly by sea routes.Potential bioclimatic suitability—harsh climatic conditions of Point Thomas OasisThe isolation of Antarctic islands is a result not only of the physical distance to other con-tinents, but also of ecological isolation (Barnes et al. 2006; Clarke et al. 2005). Similarities Biodivers Conserv 1 3in environmental features between potential propagule source areas and the Maritime Ant-arctic zone are low. Harsh abiotic conditions on KGI are the main selective ecological filter for propagules of terrestrial organisms, diminishing the probability of their establishment. In this way, both spatial and ecological isolation may play the most important role in Ant-arctic islands invasibility (e.g., Alpert et al. 2000).The typical polar maritime climate on KGI can be described as extremely inhospitable for terrestrial organisms, especially for alien homeohydric species. Mean monthly tempera-tures of 2.4  °C in January (warmest month during the austral summer) and − 6.7  °C in July (coldest month, data from Admiralty Bay, see Galera et al. 2015) together with high variation in daylight duration (ca 4.5–19.5 h, Kejna et al. 2013) may highly impact the fit-ness of introduced organisms. The difficult environmental conditions are also shaped by cyclic freezing and melting, humidifying and drying, high intensity of solar radiation in summer, including UVB, lack of light in winter, and the strong winds which act both as a desiccation and an abrasion factor (Giełwanowska et al. 2011). For potential invaders from Europe, the temporal shift between summer seasons in the Northern and Southern Hemi-spheres (Galera et  al. 2015) may also present a problem in adjustment of physiological traits associated with their phenology.For small terrestrial plants and animals capable of physiological dormancy, the thick snow cover increases the likelihood of survival by providing an insulating blanket of snow where they can remain unaffected by the low temperatures and strong desiccating winds (Ochyra et al. 2008). At the same time the snow cover can extend the cold season by preserving cold temperature close to the soil surface and shortening the growing sea-son (Schroeter et al. 2010 and literature cited therein). In comparison with other Antarctic bioregions the mean yearly precipitation on KGI is relatively high (about 700 mm, Kejna et al. 2013); however, due to prevailing subzero temperatures organisms may still be sub-ject to physiological drought. Nevertheless, the Point Thomas Oasis seems to be one of the most favorable areas for living organisms in the whole of the Maritime Antarctic.Resource availability—spatial and temporal diversity of trophic conditions of Point Thomas OasisThe primary production of Maritime Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems is extremely low, making autochthonous resources of biogenic substance minimal (Williams 1994; Hop-kins et al. 2014). Vegetation communities in this region depend largely on marine-derived biogenic substances (main vectors—marine birds and pinnipeds, Green et al. 2015). The animal-mediated nutrient deposition creates spatially restricted over-fertilized sites (ornith-ogenic soils, Tatur et al. 1997). In contrast, deglaciation processes offer sites with a substra-tum nearly entirely devoid of organic matter. The chemical weathering of rocks, the most important source of nutrients in other climatic zones, is strongly inhibited in severe polar climates (Nędzarek 2008). These contrasting processes make habitats of Point Thomas Oasis very diverse in pH and substratum fertility (Tatur et al. 1997; Zwolicki et al. 2015). Typical for polar coastal oases, the most important limiting environmental factors are water and salinity stress (physiological drought and saline aerosols, Giełwanowska et al. 2011). The Antarctic substratum is characterized by instability due to the exfoliation of rock sur-faces and cryoturbation of soil and stones (e.g., Green et  al. 2015; Ochyra et  al. 2008), together with the presence of permafrost, solifluction or ablation, significantly limiting the development of terrestrial communities (Convey et al. 2009). Biodivers Conserv1 3Specific Antarctic flora and fauna makes the food resources for potential hetero-trophic invaders very different from their habitat of origin. Therefore, trophic resources may be accessible only for organisms capable of changing their diet and feeding behav-ior. This may present an impenetrable barrier for heterotrophic monophagic species which reach the Maritime Antarctic. For example wood pests recorded in the Arctowski Station (Chwedorzewska et al. 2013; Osyczka et al. 2012). In Antarctica there are no woody plants (e.g., Convey 2010; Hughes and Convey 2014), therefore in the receiving habitat there are no food resources for these organisms. These species are also unable to complete their life cycle without access to wood and bark. All timber in Antarctic is of allochtonic origin, brought in for construction purposes, wooden crates and pallets used for cargo packaging, or driftwood impregnated by seawater (Chwedorzewska et al. 2013). Another example is the problem of accessibility to proper food resources for vagrant bird species, particularly passerines. Gryz et  al. (2015) observed that the Austral Negrito Lessonia rufahasis was unable to feed on the flightless invertebrates in Antarctica. The species’ characteristic feed-ing behavior, based on catching flying insects, was not successful in this case.Resource availability has a very high temporal variation, which may be a problem for alien terrestrial organisms. This is connected with the low primary production of palatable plants—potential fodder for grazers. The extended duration of snow cover hampers access to lichens and dead plant biomass. Similarly, the food base for predators is available mainly in the austral summer season during the breeding, molting and/or resting seasons of mari-time vertebrates (Ciaputa and Siciński 2006; Jabłoński 1986; Salwicka and Rakusa-Suszc-zewski 2002; Trivelpiece et  al. 1987a). Therefore, according to the fluctuating resource availability theory advanced by Davis et al. (2000), the invasibility of communities at Point Thomas Oasis may be low due to the low levels of unused resources available to an invader and the temporal variation. Nevertheless, this might change with climatic fluctuations, making unused resources available for potential invaders at some future point in time.Native biodiversity—low richness of autochthonous species in the Maritime AntarcticNative Antarctic terrestrial communities typically have low species richness and are thought to have low functional redundancy. At the higher taxonomic levels, many groups are missing altogether, no native pteridophytes occur in the Maritime Antarctic. Vascular plants are represented by only two species of flowering plants (e.g., Convey 2010; Hughes and Convey 2014). The poorly developed Antarctic tundra consists mostly of cryptogams. Major components of the terrestrial biota are lichens (294 species on KGI; Olech 2004) and mosses (63 species on KGI, Ochyra et al. 2008). Fauna of true terrestrial animals of the Antarctic region (sub-Antarctic and Antarctica) is limited to small invertebrates (some 520 species of soil animals, but likely underestimated) from the groups: Diptera (only two species), Acari, Collembola, Tardigrada, Nematoda and Rotifera (Houghton et al. 2016).Apart from the cetaceans, which are fully aquatic, all other Antarctic megafauna spe-cies depend on the terrestrial environment to reproduce (Forcada 2008). Species diversity is low and includes 53 species of marine birds (13 breed on KGI) and six species of pin-nipeds (five species on KGI; Salwicka and Rakusa-Suszczewski 2002). Most of those ani-mals form large breeding colonies and resting concentrations on shore which remain very patchy and strongly depend on accessibility to the shore (e.g., Shirihai 2008; Sierakowski et al. 2017; Trivelpiece et al. 1987a).Biodivers Conserv 1 3It is widely claimed that the more isolated oceanic islands should be less resistant to invasion than the less isolated ones, because endemic species of isolated oceanic islands are weak competitors (Caujape-Castells et  al. 2010, but see comments by Kueffer et  al. 2010). Hughes and Convey (2014) argue that the long history of evolutionary isolation of Antarctic biota is evidenced by high levels of endemism across most groups of organ-isms. In fact, the high percentage of endemics refer to the biota of lichens (151 endemic species—39% of biota of lichens of the Maritime and Continental Antarctic, Ochyra et al. 2008). Approximately 170 animal soil species are endemic (about 33% of terrestrial inver-tebrates fauna of the sub-Antarctic and Antarctic, e.g., Houghton et al. 2016). Almost or entirely all Nematoda fauna is endemic, despite the fact that generally nematode worms are highly capable of long-distance dispersal (Convey 2010). In contrast, the flora of bryo-phytes is characterized by a low level of endemism—no endemic taxa occur in the flora of liverworts, and the relatively rich flora of mosses contains only 6% strict Antarctic endem-ics (Ochyra et al. 2008).The correlation between native species richness and the invasibility of a habitat has been discussed by many authors (e.g., Kueffer et al. 2010; Thuiller et al. 2007). It has been shown that the relationship between species richness and ecosystem invasibility is scale-dependent (Kühn and Klotz 2007; Richardson and Pyšek 2006). However, it seems that the number of the native species, including endemic species, is less important for invasibility than, for example, the presence or absence of a species that may interact with the potential invader (Borges et al. 2006). Therefore, as stated by Crawley et al. (1999), the characteris-tics of the dominant native species may be more important for habitat invasibility than the overall species richness.Enemy release—low pressure of terrestrial consumers in AntarcticaThe trophic complexity of the Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems is thought to be generally simple and mostly relies on marine resources. The different trophic levels are represented by singular species or not represented at all (Convey 2010; Frenot et al. 2005). All verte-brates (marine birds and pinnipeds) rely on marine resources for food (Hughes and Convey 2014); there are no terrestrial herbivores in the Antarctic region (Olech et al. 2011). Preda-tors that could present pressure for alien terrestrial animals are primarily skuas Stercorarius spp. and the southern giant petrel Macronectes giganteus, which are intelligent generalists with a diverse diet and the ability to quickly change their food preferences (e.g., Carneiro et al. 2015; Malzof and Quintana 2008). The similar abundant and highly successful avian predator, the kelp gull Larus dominicanus, is characterized by its dietary breadth, wide-ranging foraging strategies, and acclimation to modified landscapes (Gallagher et al. 2015). Among the pinnipeds, the fur seal species Arctocephalus spp. could potentially present pressure for alien animals. Some incidents of predation on various birds species have been recorded in the Antarctic (e.g., Ciaputa and Siciński 2006; Visser et al. 2008).The absence of terrestrial mammalian herbivores (Olech et al. 2011) and predators may present an advantage for alien species under the enemy release hypothesis. This may pro-mote higher susceptibility of native biota to the introduction of any heterotrophic organ-isms, which may remain without control by predators (Frenot et al. 2005). This characteris-tic of Antarctic habitats leaves open ground for unobstructed development of any potential newcomer according to the enemy release hypothesis (Blossey 2011; Keane and Crawley 2002). Biodivers Conserv1 3Patchiness of habitat and open gaps—mosaic of microhabitats and low competition in the Maritime AntarcticAntarctic ice-free areas are a mosaic of microhabitats (see section Resource availability), clearly differentiated by abiotic features, e.g., water conditions, salinity and/or nutrient con-tent of substratum. This patchiness also shapes the distribution of microorganisms in Mari-time Antarctic, making the interactions involved more limited in space and different from species-rich environments (Bölter et al. 1997). Harsh environmental conditions impact the poor development of vegetation and loose vegetation cover (see Wilson et  al. 2007 and sections The possibilities of bioclimatic suitability and Native biodiversity in this article). This type of open habitat leaves potential for ecological niches to be filled by newcomers and presents the possibility for establishment of novel trophic functions in the ecosystem (Hughes and Convey 2014).Due to the severe environmental conditions native Antarctic biota is characterized by a predominant life history of poor competitive ability and vulnerability to invasion by more effective competitors (Convey 2010; Hughes and Convey 2014). On one hand, this relaxed competitive ability of indigenous organisms is promoted by the harsh environmental condi-tions in Antarctica, and on the other by the spatial isolation of the islands (Kühn and Klotz 2007), enhancing the high invasibility of this region. The underlying assumption is that an invading species will benefit in a community where it does not encounter intense competi-tion for resources (Alpert et al. 2000).System contextIn the case of spatially isolated habitats, the breaking of geographic barriers is of major importance for the system context (spatial and temporal influence arising outside the habi-tat that might be invaded; Foxcroft et al. 2011). The breaking of a geographic barrier has been mostly achieved through deliberate introduction and cultivation of economic (espe-cially ornamental) plants. This general principle is pertinent in the majority of oceanic island plant invasions (e.g., Keller et al. 2011; Kueffer et al. 2010). In contrast, the prop-agule pressure on Antarctic islands is mainly mediated through inadvertent introductions. Strict phytosanitary regulations are aimed at reducing the likelihood of the introduction of alien propagules by this vector (Chown et al. 2012a; Hughes and Convey 2014). Due to the strict spatial and ecological isolation of the Point Thomas Oasis (chapter Geographical barrier), humans are the only vector of alien propagule dispersal. This is true for long dis-tance transportation (transoceanic), as well as for local propagule dispersal within the Ant-arctic between islands and ice-free oases. Transport duration and conditions have to meet propagule survival requirements to enable their establishment in the target environment. The route and mode of transport are key aspects for the probability of invasion success.The natural fine scale vectors are wind and birds, including vagrant species (birds found far outside their expected range). There are several potential mechanisms by which vagrant individuals arrive in the Antarctic. They may have either drifted off course from their nor-mal migration routes by austral gales (e.g., Lazo and Yañez 1989), traveling on errant head-ings (e.g., Lees and Gilroy 2009), or may represent the vanguard of individuals pioneering new migration routes—“pseudo-vagrants” sensu Gilroy and Lees (Gilroy and Lees 2003; Korczak-Abshire et al. 2011a). They may be potential diaspore migration agents.Biodivers Conserv 1 3Migration pathways—limited transport capability in the Maritime AntarcticAntarctica has received a rapid increase in tourism over the last two decades (e.g., Chwedorzewska 2009; Chwedorzewska and Korczak 2010). Tourist airplane flights over the Antarctic continent started in the 1950s and were soon followed by cruises to the South Shetland Islands (Frenot et al. 2005). In comparison with other areas of the World (Hulme 2009), the intensity of these visits remains small. The main means of transport of alien species into Antarctica are tourist and expedition ships, despite the quarantine inspections and fumigation at cargo facilities (Houghton et al. 2016). The number of cruise ship visits at Arctowski Station during each of the last seven austral summers has ranged from 7 to 29, with 350 to even 5700 persons landing per season (Chwedorzewska et al. 2015, Fig. 2). Most tourists are from Europe, North America and Japan (Chwedorzewska 2009). Above all, ships (touristic, research, fishing and military vessels) can be accompanied by vagrant birds (Gryz et  al. 2015; Korczak-Abshire et  al. 2011b), capable of bringing alien prop-agules to the Antarctic. Ship—assisting vagrant birds transported to South Shetland Islands have been reported by Couve and Vidal (2003) and Shirihai (2008).The abundance of propagules of alien species was found to be pathway dependent (Houghton et al. 2016). The majority of tourist ships depart from Ushuaia or Punta Are-nas and participate in multi-site tours. The sequence of sites visited over the short time period is from warmer areas of higher biodiversity (Tierra del Fuego and sub-Antarctic islands) to the cooler highly pristine sites in Maritime Antarctica and the Antarctic con-tinent (Chwedorzewska 2009). For most ships, the Polish Station is the first place visited after departure from South America. Furthermore, the same ships commonly visit high-latitude polar regions in the Northern Hemisphere within 6 months of departing for Ant-arctica (Chwedorzewska and Korczak 2010). Also the supply ship of the Polish Antarctic Station operates as a tourist ship in the Arctic during the boreal summer (Chwedorzewska 2009). This can increase the probability of introduction of non-native species with pre-adaptations to survive in polar conditions.Fig. 2  Tourists visiting Arctowski Station in the austral summer. Photo by M. Wódkiewicz Biodivers Conserv1 3Despite the huge number of landing people, tourism seems to contribute only a minor proportion of alien propagule traffic. The main reasons are strict phytosanitary regulations (www.iaato .org) and the short visit time—tourists are responsible for only 5% of total per-son days spent on land in Antarctica (Jabour 2009). In contrast the equipment and clothes of station personnel do not undergo such strict inspection. Station staff constitute a smaller group of people visiting the Antarctic (Frenot et al. 2005), however their stay is consid-erably longer and therefore creates a greater impact on the environment (e.g., Lee and Chown 2009a, b). It is estimated that about 75 Antarctic research stations are inhabited by around 4000 employees in austral summer while approximately 1000 people stay for the winter (Hughes and Convey 2014). In the last seven seasons the number of expeditioners working at Arctowski Station has ranged from 6 to 8 wintering persons (staying at the sta-tion at least 12 months) and 5–33 persons staying only for the austral summer (from 2 to 6 months, Arctowski Station logbook).For the Polish Antarctic Station the main means of transportation is by ship and heli-copter. Air transportation is not frequent and of marginal importance for Arctowski Station (small number of passengers and volume of cargo). While the transport of alien animals into Antarctica by air has been reported in literature (Frenot et al. 2005), the probability of an invasion mediated by air traffic in Point Thomas Oasis still seems to be low.Functional connectivity—factors enabling the survival of alien propagules during transport to Point Thomas OasisThe main introduction routes are associated with polar station provisioning. Alien organ-isms might be accidentally transported on packaging materials, vehicles, scientific equipment, construction materials. Fresh food products and staff personal items includ-ing clothes, boots and luggage all have the increased probability of propagule carryover (Chwedorzewska et al. 2013; Chown et al. 2012b; Lityńska-Zając et al. 2012). The Polish Station is usually provisioned once a year, with small amounts of fresh products resup-plied from South America several times during the summer season. The majority of cargo destined to Arctowski Station originates in Poland, but some fresh fruit, vegetables and eggs are supplied from Argentina. The produce are transported at 4 °C for approximately 40 days from Poland and 7 days from Argentina. These conditions may prolong the longev-ity of a wide spectrum of living organisms. The rest of the cargo (on average 30 tonnes per year), excluding frozen items, are kept in the ship’s hold, where conditions may also pro-mote survival of many propagules (Chwedorzewska et al. 2013).Transportation conditions may on the other hand limit the successful arrival of prop-agules to the target environment. In the case of animals with a short life cycle, long dura-tion transport presents a major barrier as the life of some invertebrates is too short to sur-vive the passage to King George Island where they could potentially close their life cycle (Chwedorzewska et al. 2013).Propagule pressure—diversity of propagules reaching Point Thomas OasisDue to the distinct spatial isolation of Antarctica, direct observations of alien propagule migration to the Polish Antarctic Station were possible. Due to strict control of potential vectors (compare sections Geographical barrier and Migration pathways) this presents a unique possibility to perform a direct study of propagule pressure.Biodivers Conserv 1 3Altogether 103 alien species were found to arrive to Point Thomas Oasis (Electronic Supplementary Material A1). During three summer seasons, 148 generative diaspores belonging to 45 species of flowering plants alien to the Maritime Antarctic were found on personnel field clothing, gear and equipment (Lityńska-Zając et  al. 2012). Juncus bufo-nius has not been physically observed in Antarctica, but its diaspores capable of germina-tion were found in soil samples collected in the vicinity of Arctowski Station (Cuba-Díaz et  al. 2013). A total of 45 specimens of non-indigenous lichens belonging to 24 species alien to the Antarctic biota were found on the cargo of one of the expeditions (mostly on wooden pallets and cases; Osyczka 2010). Also nine species of macrofungi were discov-ered on timber brought for one of the expeditions (Osyczka et al. 2012). In the cargo of three expeditions, altogether 271 live specimens of 24 species of invertebrates were found, mostly among the fresh fruits and vegetables (Chwedorzewska et al. 2013). Additionally, four specimens of insects belonging to two species were noted on timber materials for one of the expeditions (Osyczka et al. 2012). Only a Barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) individual observed in Point Thomas Oasis (Korczak-Abshire et al. 2011b) could be considered as an alien vertebrate species transported to Antarctica by a human vector as individuals of this species have been observed on vessels visiting Antarctica (e.g., Shirihai 2008; Couve and Vidal 2003; Joseph Charles Abshire, the captain of RV Laurence M. Gould, also observed a juvenile Barn swallow on board off shore of Livingston Island in South Shetlands archi-pelago on 6th Nov 2011).The relatively large propagule pressure in Antarctica, however unexpected it may seem at first, has also been confirmed by other authors (Hughes and Pertierra 2016; Houghton et al. 2016 and literature cited therein). Around 10 alien plant species have survived the Antarctic environmental conditions (sometimes their identification was ambiguous; Hughes and Pertierra 2016). Some alien species function only in artificial manmade habi-tats and are not observed in the outside environment, such as Trichocera maculipennis and Lycoriella ingenua (Hughes et al. 2005; Houghton et al. 2016; Hughes and Pertierra 2016) or populations of Drosophila melanogaster and Ctenosciara hyalipennis found almost every year in the vegetable warehouse at Arctowski Station (Chwedorzewska et al. 2013). All these findings indirectly confirm propagule pressure. Despite the relatively high spe-cies diversity of propagules reaching Arctowski Station (Electronic Supplementary Mate-rial A1) only one species (Poa annua) has penetrated the survival (Olech 1996), reproduc-tion (Wódkiewicz et al. 2013), as well as dispersal and environmental barriers (Olech and Chwedorzewska 2011; Galera et al. 2017).Spatial and temporal patterns of propagule arrival—potential invasion hotspots associated with human occupied sites in Antarctic stationsIn the context of the framework, it has been proposed that the spatial arrangement of hab-itats subject to different kinds and levels of anthropopressure (e.g., areas strongly trans-formed by man vs. relatively undisturbed natural habitats) “provides essential context that will influence the functional connectivity and transfer of propagules between patches” (Foxcroft et al. 2011). Simberloff (2009) also indicates that the spatial and temporal pat-terns of propagule arrival are an important component. It is typical that the areas of highest human-generated disturbance neighbor logistics cargo hubs (e.g., railway areas—Brandes 1983, 2005; Wiłkomirski et al. 2012; inland ports—Brandes 1989; airports and seaports—Tatem et al. 2006). A similar phenomenon can be observed in the Antarctic. Biodivers Conserv1 3Human activities in the Antarctic are concentrated mainly in small, scattered, ice-free coastal zones. Most of the research stations are also located at these coastal areas which are at the same time favorable to development of biological communities (e.g., Hughes and Convey 2014; Hughes et al. 2011). Moreover, the sites most likely visited by tourists coincide with the locations of most scientific bases and high wildlife concentration. Due to the interaction of the comparatively favorable microclimate and expanding human inter-est in the vicinity of research stations, the likelihood of encroachment by alien organisms increases. Areas near polar research stations generally receive frequent visits (station staff and some of the stations also tourists). The consequences may be visible immediately, but are often cumulative and may only become apparent over a longer time (Chwedorzewska and Korczak 2010). The construction and utilization of the Antarctic research station infra-structure results in irreversible environmental impacts (Hughes and Convey 2014; Frenot et al. 2005). Thus, all known introductions of terrestrial alien species have been found in the vicinity of the research stations (Hughes and Worland 2010; Hughes et al. 2012; Olech 1996). The majority of activities associated with the functioning of the stations are per-formed during the austral summer. This presents a high probability of alien propagules reaching potentially invasible sites and become established, in comparison with the winter season when the area is covered by snow and conditions disable life development.Tourists are attracted mainly to sites of high/medium biological diversity (Frenot et al. 2005 and literature cited therein), and their visits concentrate on small coastal areas rather than on inland ice (Bölter and Stonehouse 2002). The standard pattern of visits during the 1980s and 1990s was simply to land on beaches and observe any immediately accessible wildlife, but the options now include extensive walks, kayaking, skiing, and even a mara-thon (see www.marat honto ur.com). Currently, over 30,000 ship-based tourists visit the Antarctic region each year (Chown et al. 2012b), making use of the over 150 landing sites. While some locations receive only a few visits per decade, the most popular may be visited three times weekly throughout the summer season (even 430 landings per site, see iaato.org).Arctowski Station is one of the most attractive Antarctic research stations for tourists. Here, visitors have good access to such attractions as a penguin rookery, gathering places of pinnipeds, relics of the whaling industry (e.g., harpoons, whale bones), valuable plant communities, and a visit to the main station building (Zwolicki et al. 2015).Global change—rapid climate change on King George IslandEarlier studies indicated that the climate of Antarctica is closely linked with other parts of the global climate system (Summerhayes 2009; Turner et al. 2014). However recently Turner et  al. (2016) contradicted these findings stating that the local changes “are not primarily associated with the drivers of global temperature change but, rather, reflect the extreme natural internal variability of the regional atmospheric circulation”. Numerous authors showed that the climatic conditions of the Antarctic Peninsula region show the largest warming trend in the whole Antarctic (e.g., Nielsen and Wall 2013; Turner 2009; Turner et al. 2014). Data from 1948 to 2011 from nine meteorological stations located on KGI and on Deception Island, 120 km away from KGI (Kejna et  al. 2013) indicate that an increase in air temperature has occurred, reaching 0.19  °C/10  years. In summer, the warming was more than twice as high as in wintertime (Kejna et al. 2013). However the latest data of Braun et  al. (2017) indicate that the summer warming trend that persisted on KGI until the end of 20st century has collapsed. Data from the last years indicate that Biodivers Conserv 1 3the climate in the Antarctic Peninsula region is more variable in space and time than pre-viously expected (Turner et al. 2016; Braun et al. 2017; Sancho et al. 2017). Such rapid changes of weather conditions may disturb the ecosystem balance what may increase its susceptibility to invasions.In contrast to changes in mean monthly air temperature, the precipitation level on KGI has only changed minimally (Braun et al. 2017). In the Maritime Antarctic, summer pre-cipitation increasingly occurs as rain rather than snow (Chwedorzewska 2009). This increases liquid water availability during the vegetation season. The water availability is still increased by seasonal snow and glacial melt (Turner 2009; Turner et al. 2014). The melting of ice banks not only increases water resources but also uncovers large areas from under the ice cover (Chwedorzewska 2009). The most spectacular changes in polar regions are colonization and primary succession on glacier forefields recently denuded of ice (e.g., Chwedorzewska 2009; Olech et al. 2011). The process of climate warming in this region (even if local and temporal) will enable the survival and spread of alien species once intro-duced (e.g., Frenot et al. 2005; Olech and Chwedorzewska 2011) should they possess the strategy of soil seed bank formation. This poses the risk that Antarctic taxa, well adapted to cold environments, will come eventually under pressure and may be pushed out of their natural environments by newcomers (Chwedorzewska 2009; Convey 2003; Frenot et  al. 2005; Hughes and Convey 2014). If climate change follows a warming trend, the conse-quences may be expected to include increased diversity, biomass and trophic complexity, all of which contribute to the development of a more complex terrestrial ecosystem struc-ture (Convey 2006). Climate warming may alter the natural distribution limits for species or even whole communities (Convey 2003; Convey and Lewis Smith 1993). Consequences at ecosystem level may be wide-ranging, rather than being restricted to just the directly impacted taxa (Chwedorzewska 2008; Olech 1996).Providing a further climate warming the related factors, such as altered depth and extent of snow cover, permafrost melt, recession of glaciers, freeze–thaw cycles, and potential increase in the frequency and magnitude of extreme events, may influence plant and ani-mal communities (see overview by Nielsen and Wall 2013). For example the white-rumped sandpiper Calidris fuscicollis with only sporadic visits has become more frequent on KGI and can be the first example of a natural species range shift (Korczak-Abshire et al. 2011a; Trivelpiece et al. 1987b). This trend could be the result of short term and longer term vari-ations in weather and climate conditions during the austral spring and summer months, when this species is observed. In addition however, a higher air temperature, which is a result of predominant northerly winds bringing relatively warm and moist air, would prob-ably result in habitats more suitable for settlement and better food resources that would allow the birds to persist or survive. Such precedent has already taken place in Point Thomas Oasis area. Individuals of a non-native bird species Calidris fuscicollis have been seen feeding on accumulations of macroalgae remains after storms and exposed seaweed flora during warmer summer seasons (Korczak-Abshire et al. 2011a).The ozone hole has increased the penetration of UV-B radiation in Antarctica to levels similar as in moderate climate zone (Frenot et al. 2005; Robinson et al. 2003). The UV-B radiation varies throughout the year with elevated levels coinciding with the time of plant emergence from winter dormancy and melting of the protective snow cover (Robinson et al. 2003). While alien species that come from other climatic zones may be preadapted to higher UV-B levels, native Antarctic organisms may have had relatively little time for evo-lutionary adjustment and acclimation to new conditions (Robinson et al. 2003). However some Antarctic mosses have been found to quickly deploy sufficient UV protection (News-ham et al. 2002; Green et al. 2005). Negative effects of UV-B can be reduced by various  Biodivers Conserv1 3defense mechanisms (Robinson et al. 2003; Turnbull et al. 2009). However, their launch is associated with the additional costs, which may prove to be too large, especially for organ-isms living at the physiological limits of survival.The potential changes in species distribution due to climatic changes have been addressed by many authors (Thuiller et  al. 2007; in city environment—e.g., Neil and Wu 2006; Sukopp and Wurzel 2003, and literature cited therein). However, the patterns observed in the Arctic or alpine zones representing a spatial continuum within a continent (Nielsen and Wall 2013), may not apply to the Maritime Antarctic due to a lack in spatial connectivity between regions differing in climatic conditions.Residence time—low probability of survival through the lag phase in the AntarcticIn other regions under favorable conditions a long residence time is one of the most cited factors preceding a successful invasion (Houghton et al. 2016; Richardson and Pyšek 2006; Wilson et al. 2007) and has almost exclusively been studied post factum. In contrast, due to harsh weather conditions in the Maritime Antarctic, the factors promoting plant growth are met for only a short time during the year. Moreover, in some years they may not be reached at all. This would induce the residence time to be extended in comparison with the temperate regions. Also the stochastic occurrence of extreme conditions and any possi-ble human caused disturbance of the newly established population of an alien species may decrease the probability of alien species survival. These factors may break the residence time required for a species to accomplish a successful invasion. A good example is the dis-persal of P. annua on Deception Island interrupted by a volcanic eruption (Chwedorzewska et al. 2015).Species invasivenessThe characteristic of invasive species has already been analyzed by many authors (Keller et al. 2011; Kueffer et al. 2010; Moles et al. 2008; Pyšek and Richardson 2007). Treating functional traits of a potential invaders as a prerequisite for successful invasion is often criticized. During the last few years a debate has focused on genetic diversity and phe-notypic plasticity in alien populations of invasive species (Colautti et al. 2017; Espeland 2013). These phenomena restrict the possibility to fully study species invasiveness only to post factum situations—during an ongoing invasion. The assessment of risk associated with alien organisms while they are still in the lag time and before they enter the phase of expansion is therefore highly limited.In the case of invasions in Antarctica local climatic conditions may favor the invasion of poikilothermic and poikilohydric organisms, with a broad capacity to tolerate extreme conditions, notably low and rapidly fluctuating temperatures and tissue water content. Only a few flowering plants possess such traits. The transplantation experiments showed that Antarctic conditions prevent the survival and spread of intentionally introduced terrestrial plants. It is worth highlighting that these experiments resulted in accidental introduction of P. pratensis at Cierva Point (Danco Coast, Antarctic Peninsula; Pertierra et al. 2017).A successful invasion is more probable when conditions in the target community par-allel those in the native range of the invader. This especially pertains to similar climatic zones. Therefore, Arctic and alpine species originating from the coldest parts of the globe Biodivers Conserv 1 3may be especially fit for the particularly harsh Antarctic conditions. Arctic and alpine organisms may possess the necessary life history features making them resistant to unfa-vorable abiotic conditions, and similarly to Antarctic organisms may be of low competi-tive ability. However the probability of unintended exchange of propagules between these areas is extremely low (except potentially by transport in a tourist vessel operating both in the Arctic and Antarctic). This further diminishes the probability of invasion. The lack of any Arctic or alpine species in a list of 15 worst invasive alien plants in broader Antarctic (McGeoch et al. 2015) seems to confirm this hypothesis.Edaphic conditions prevailing in the Antarctic may favor the spread of species tolerating high soil salinity and unfavorable mechanic properties. This hypothesis has been confirmed under Maritime Antarctic conditions. For example, the only successful alien flowering plant P. annua exhibits a high tolerance to saline, poorly aerated, and compacted soils (e.g., Chwedorzewska et al. 2015; Giełwanowska et al. 2011). A population of this species exist-ing at Point Thomas Oasis for over 30 years displays specific traits that enabled its success-ful invasion (Wódkiewicz et  al. 2014, 2018; Galera et  al. 2015, 2017). High phenotypic plasticity of this species may be a key driving factor.ConclusionsOur work should be seen not as a direct comparison of South African (Foxcroft et al. 2011; Vardien et al. 2012) and Antarctic systems. The expanded conceptual framework opens up wider possibilities in analyzing invasions taking place in different systems. In such a way we may be able to refine our ideas instead of multiplying the number “disposable” tools such as theoretical frameworks. Moreover, the expanded conceptual framework used in this study enables an assessment of the threat of alien organisms belonging to different taxa. We have invoked additional mechanisms specific to the Antarctic region. However, we did not fully address one element of expanded framework—species invasiveness (Fig. 1), due to the goal of predicting invasions of undefined organisms, that is not belonging to a spe-cific taxa.The Arctowski Station system presented a unique opportunity to analyze relationships between system context and specific characteristics of the Antarctic habitat influencing the susceptibility of the region to invasion. The isolation and simple trophic complexity of the Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems, the legal obligation to enforce control over Polar Station functioning, relatively low penetration of Point Thomas Oasis by tourists, have all ena-bled a detailed analysis of factors influencing the probability of biological invasion of this area. The most important factors presenting a barrier to the encroachment of alien species are the harsh environmental conditions and high isolation of Antarctica. The pressure of autochtonous competitors and consumers may be seen as a less obstructive factor for the establishment of alien organisms.Our analysis indicates that Antarctica is threatened by invasions due to the complexity of factors belonging to the system context (Fig. 1). It is almost impossible to stop climate changes from increasing the habitat susceptibility of this region. Therefore, an effective way of preventing biological invasions in Antarctica seems to lie in reducing propagule pressure and eliminating alien populations as early as possible.Acknowledgements This work was supported by The National Science Centre by a Grant No 218361 (2013/09/B/NZ8/03293).

Location: Australia's Antarctic continental stations: Davis, Mawson and Casey, East Antarctica; and subantarctic islands: Macquarie Island and Heard and McDonald Islands. Methods: Our study uses a novel machine-learning algorithm to predict which currently known hull fouling MIS could survive in shallow benthic ecosystems adjacent to Australian Antarctic research stations and subantarctic islands, where ship traffic is present. We used gradient boosted machine learning (XGBoost) with four important environmental variables (sea surface temperature, salinity, nitrate and pH) to develop models of suitable environments for each potentially invasive species. We then used these models to determine if any of Australia's three Antarctic research stations and two subantarctic islands could be environmentally suitable for MIS now and under two future climate scenarios. Results: Most of the species were predicted to be unable to survive at any location between now and the end of this century; however, four species were identified as potential current threats and five as threats under future climate change. Asterias amurensis was identified as a potential threat to all locations. Main conclusions: This study suggests that the risks are very low, but plausible, that known hull fouling species could survive in the shallow benthic habitats near Australia's East Antarctica locations and suggest a precautionary approach is needed by way of surveillance and monitoring in this region, particularly if propagule pressure increases. While some species could survive as adults in the region, their ability to reach these locations and undergo successful reproduction is considered unlikely based on current knowledge.</p",,Contribution to Journal,"climate change, East Antarctica, gradient boosting, hull fouling, invasion biology, machine learning, Northern Pacific sea star, ports, subantarctic, XGBoost",,Wiley-Blackwell Publishing Ltd
Antarctic climate-diversity-invasion hypothesis,186546685,Antarctica’s ecological isolation will be broken by storm-driven dispersal and warming,,"Fraser, Ceridwen I., Morrison, Adele K., Hogg, Andrew Mc C., Macaya, Erasmo C., van Sebille, Erik, Ryan, Peter G., Padovan, Amanda, Jack, Cameron, Valdivia, Nelson, Waters, Jonathan M.",2018,"Antarctica has long been considered biologically isolated1. Global warming will make parts of Antarctica more habitable for invasive taxa, yet presumed barriers to dispersal—especially the Southern Ocean’s strong, circumpolar winds, ocean currents and fronts—have been thought to protect the region from non-anthropogenic colonizations from the north1,2. We combine molecular and oceanographic tools to directly test for biological dispersal across the Southern Ocean. Genomic analyses reveal that rafting keystone kelps recently travelled >20,000 km and crossed several ocean-front ‘barriers’ to reach Antarctica from mid-latitude source populations. High-resolution ocean circulation models, incorporating both mesoscale eddies and wave-driven Stokes drift, indicate that such Antarctic incursions are remarkably frequent and rapid. Our results demonstrate that storm-forced surface waves and ocean eddies can dramatically enhance oceanographic connectivity for drift particles in surface layers, and show that Antarctica is not biologically isolated. We infer that Antarctica’s long-standing ecological differences have been the result of environmental extremes that have precluded the establishment of temperate-adapted taxa, but that such taxa nonetheless frequently disperse to the region. Global warming thus has the potential to allow the establishment of diverse new species—including keystone kelps that would drastically alter ecosystem dynamics—even without anthropogenic introductions",,Letter,"Taverne, Environmental Science (miscellaneous), Social Sciences (miscellaneous)",,

Current species diversity indeed decreases toward the poles, with Antarctica for instance being depauperate compared to tropical regions. This ubiquitous pattern has long attracted the attention of naturalists and more recently of evolutionary biologists and paleontologists to understand why species diversity peaks at the equator. However, it remains poorly understood how polar biodiversity originated and diversified. Antarctica is currently defined as three large biogeographic regions: the Maritime Antarctic, the sub-Antarctic, and the Continental Antarctic. The Maritime Antarctic region is largely separated from the rest of the world’s oceans due to the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), differences in temperature along the Antarctic Polar Front (APF), and the presence of a deep sea surrounding the Antarctic shelf (1). The sub-Antarctic region consists of dozens of islands contained within the APF, generally characterized by the presence of tundra (absent from the Continental Antarctic) and fellfield habitats. As for the Continental Antarctic region, it is mostly uninhabitable, with less than 0.5% of its surface being ice-free. A long-standing idea is that biodiversity in Antarctica is low, and only constituted of old and poorly diversified lineages. In PNAS, a study (2)—relying on both microevolutionary and macroevolutionary approaches—challenges this idea and shows that terrestrial life can thrive there",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/article, Journal articles",[SDV.BID]Life Sciences [q-bio]/Biodiversity,,National Academy of Sciences

The introduction of non-native species can have severe consequences for indigenous biota with changes in both ecosystem structure and function. The Antarctic region has not escaped this threat. The introduction of invasive species, including vertebrates, invertebrates and plants, has altered substantially the ecosystems of many sub-Antarctic islands. In contrast, the Antarctic continent itself currently has few confirmed non-native species, but numbers are increasing. Possible future increases in human presence in the region, either through tourism, governmental operators or other commercial activities, will increase the risk of further non-native species introductions, while climate change may enhance the likelihood of establishment and range expansion.

Non‐native marine  species will interact with other anthropogenic stressors affecting Antarctic ecosystems,  such as climate change (warming, ocean acidification) and pollution, with irreversible  ramifications for biodiversity and ecosystem services. We review current  knowledge of non‐native marine species in the Antarctic region, the physical and  physiological factors that resist establishment of non‐native marine species, changes  to resistance under climate change, the role of legislation in limiting marine introductions,  and the effect of increasing human activity on vectors and pathways of introduction.  Evidence of non‐native marine species is limited: just four marine non‐native  and one cryptogenic species that were likely introduced anthropogenically have been  reported freely living in Antarctic or sub‐Antarctic waters, but no established populations  have been reported; an additional six species have been observed in pathways  to Antarctica that are potentially at risk of becoming invasive. We present estimates  of the intensity of ship activity across fishing, tourism and research sectors: there  may be approximately 180 vessels and 500+ voyages in Antarctic waters annually.  However, these estimates are necessarily speculative because relevant data are  scarce.

This paradigm, as well as incorporating a new and much longer timescale in which to consider the evolution and adaptation of Antarctic terrestrial biota, opens important new cross-disciplinary linkages with geologists and glaciologists seeking to unravel the history of the continent itself. This unique biota now faces the twin challenges of responding to the complex processes of climate change facing some parts of the continent, and the direct impacts associated with human occupation and activity. In many instances, this biota is likely to benefit, initially at least, from the current environmental changes, and there is an expectation of increased production, biomass, population size, community complexity, and colonisation. However, the impacts of climate change may themselves be outweighed by other, direct, impacts of human activities, and in particular, the introduction of non-indigenous organisms from which until recently the terrestrial ecosystems of the continent have been protected. The Antarctic research community and those responsible for governance under the Antarctic treaty system are faced with the pressing challenges of (1) ensuring there is sufficient baseline monitoring and survey activity to enable identification of these changes, however caused and (2) ensuring that effective operational management and biosecurity procedures are in place to minimise the threat from anthropogenic activities",,"Publication - Article, PeerReviewed",Ecology and Environment,,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC'

Chwedorzewska,2014,"Abstract: Although the Antarctic has avoided the worst effects of alien species, its future seems endangered due to increasing natural and man−made pressures. Rapid changes in three major environmental variables have occurred in the Antarctic region during the last decades. In the short term terrestrial biota are likely to benefit from reduced environmental stresses, but in the long run the colonization of the region by lower latitude species with greater competi− tive ability will become increasingly important and can lead to large−scale changes in biologi− cal composition and trophic complexity in some existing Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems. Moreover, the recent dynamic climate changes combined with human activities in the Antarc− tic region might modify the status of several alien species which have hitherto been consid− ered transient or persistent and could, therefore, become naturalized and threaten the native communities on a larger scale than today, or influence the status of naturalized species.

The present study provides an overview of the vulnerability of sub-Antarctic terrestrial communities with respect to two interacting factors, namely climate change and alien insects. We present datasets assimilated by our teams on the Kerguelen Islands since 1974, coupled with a review of the literature, to evaluate the mechanism and impact of biological invasions in this region. First, we consider recent climatic trends of the Antarctic region, and its potential influence on the establishment, distribution and abundance of alien insects, using as examples one fly and one beetle species. Second, we consider to what extent limited gene pools may restrict alien species' colonisations. Finally, we consider the vulnerability of native communities to aliens using the examples of one beetle, one fly, and five aphid species taking into consideration their additional impact as plant virus vectors.

The ACC is formed where cold seawaters sink beneath the northerly warmer waters. It acts as a biological barrier: organisms are not able to cross it because of the deeply different physicochemical properties of seawaters. Thus, only large animals can cross it (cetaceans, seabirds). The atmosphere over the southern hemisphere shows also a polar front where the Ferrell Cell (mid-latitude air circulation) meets the polar cell: in the former, the air flows toward the poles and eastward near the surface and equatorially and westerly at higher altitudes. At the front, air rises and travels towards the pole, where it sinks forming the polar highs. The Antarctic continent and the Southern Ocean are almost isolated from the other oceans and air masses and thus the turnover is very low. These geographical and air/ocean circulation features make this region of the planet difficult to be reached by persistent organic pollutants (POPs). At the same time, other characteristics of the continent and of the Southern Ocean affect the sinking and bioaccumulation of POPs in abiotic and biotic compartments of Antarctic ecosystems. © 2012 by Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC",,info:eu-repo/semantics/bookPart,,,place:BOCA RATON
Antarctic climate-diversity-invasion hypothesis,584414746,Climate change and invasion impacts in the sub-Antarctic,10.5281/zenodo.4751646,"Treasure, Ann",2012,"Climate change and biological invasions are major threats to biodiversity. In particular, these threats are predicted to influence terrestrial systems in the sub-Antarctic, where significant ecosystem responses to both have already been seen. In this thesis, the  sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Island group is used as a model system in which to investigate key questions relating to climate change and invasive species impacts. The island group comprises two islands, Marion (MI) and Prince Edward (PEI), both of which are experiencing rapid warming, yet have different invasive assemblages and in consequence are experiencing different impacts.  Variation in the patterns of invasive species richness and abundance and their underlying causes are matters of considerable ecological and conservation significance. While an increase in thermal energy availability typically results in an increase in species richness, the mechanisms underlying these patterns are poorly understood. In Chapter 2 of this thesis, these relationships are explored for springtails, an important component of the soil fauna on Marion Island. Energy explains a large amount of the spatial variation in indigenous and invasive springtail species richness. Disturbance thresholds and stressful temperatures are more important than increased population sizes in determining this variation in species richness. As both indigenous and invasive springtail species richness and abundance are strongly related to temperature, a warming climate could have  far-reaching consequences for these organisms. In particular, invasive species are predicted to be at an advantage relative to indigenous species under warming conditions.  One species where this seems especially likely, given its physiological responses to experimental warming and drying, is the large invasive tomocerid, Pogonognathellus flavescens. Determining whether this will be the case depends on understanding the factors underlying its range limits and abundance structure. Moreover, few studies have sought to distinguish the causal basis of abundance structure and range limits, particularly for invasive species. Thus, in Chapter 3, local microclimate variables and physiological tolerances of the invasive springtail, P. flavescens (a habitat generalist), are examined. The results suggest that the species should be widely distributed across a range of habitats on MI. However, the springtail is restricted to indigenous Poa cookii tussock grassland habitats in the southeast. The current range limits are set by dispersal limitation (i.e. contingent absences) whilst abundance structure is a function of variation in soil substrate quality. However, over time, the widening distribution of P. cookii, as a consequence of a major management intervention (the eradication of feral cats), may enable P. flavescens to colonise all suitable areas.  In Chapter 4, the focus changes to what has been considered the third major response to climate change, along with range and phenological responses - changing animal body sizes. Body size is one of the most significant and obvious features of animals and is of considerable ecological and physiological importance. A prediction of the temperature-size rule (TSR) is that with warming, body size of the weevil species on both MI and PEI should decline. However, predation by mice of the weevils on MI should fundamentally affect the pattern of such change, causing it to differ from neighbouring PEI, indicating synergistic impacts between climate change and invasions. Analysis of a 24-year data set indicates a decline in the body size of all weevil species on PEI with increasing temperature. However, on MI, a negative relationship between mean annual temperature and body size is found only for Palirhoeus eatoni, a species not eaten by mice. A possible explanation for the positive relationships found for the other species could be due to higher metabolic demands imposed on mice in colder years than in warmer ones. Any increase in predation coupled with a preference for larger sizes, which the mice clearly show, would lead to a decline in the mean size of the weevil species. Due to the relationship between body size and metabolic rate and the importance of the weevils in the islands' food webs, changes to the body size of these organisms could have significant consequences for the island ecosystems' functioning.  The thermal environment experienced by organisms also has a direct effect on survival, growth and reproduction. The physiological response of organisms to rapidly changing climates is therefore a primary concern. Organisms may respond to variable environmental conditions through phenotypic plasticity as well as behaviour. Chapter 5 of this thesis shows that of the weevil species and populations investigated on MI, most display phenotypic plasticity, the form of which is in keeping with the 'Hotter is Better' hypothesis. This could be due to rare extreme temperature events and the advantage for the performance curves to incorporate high temperatures experienced in the environment. Mismatches between thermal optima and preferred temperatures displayed by all species could mean that these weevils are well equipped to cope with warming conditions on MI unless the prediction of an increase of rare extreme events such as extreme temperatures is realised.  Rapidly changing climates and an increase in the introduction of non-indigenous species are issues of major conservation concern. This has increased the significance of studies on the impacts of these threats. However, this thesis shows that to understand such processes, it is essential that an integration of disciplines be undertaken. This thesis thus adopts a multidisciplinary approach and highlights key issues associated with both climate change and biological invasions. The patterns and predictions of species and community responses to these environmental changes are complex. Moreover, predicting such responses is likely to be problematic, especially as multiple factors will change concurrently and how these factors might change is unclear. This highlights the importance of long-term records for understanding organism responses to such changes. Furthermore, impacts on indigenous species are likely to be exacerbated by the predicted increase in the rate of introductions with climate change. This makes the case for preventing the dispersal of invasive species to new areas all the more important.To assess the impacts of climate change and invasive species in the sub-Antarcti",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/other, dataset","species-energy relationships, thermal biology, body size, abundance structure, Climate change, invasive species, sub-Antarctic, Marion Island, PhD",,

The discovery of non-native kelp washed up on Antarctic beaches led us to question the permeability of these barriers to species dispersal. According to the literature, over 70 million kelp rafts are afloat in the Southern Ocean at any one time. These living, floating islands can play host to a range of passenger species from both their original coastal location and those picked in the open ocean. Driven by winds, currents and storms towards the coast of the continent, these rafts are often cited as theoretical vectors for the introduction of new species into Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic islands. We found non-native kelps, with a wide range of """"hitchhiking"""" passenger organisms, on an Antarctic beach inside the flooded caldera of an active volcanic island. This is the first evidence of non-native species reaching the Antarctic continent alive on kelp rafts. One passenger species, the bryozoan Membranipora membranacea, is found to be an invasive and ecologically harmful species in some cold-water regions, and this is its first record from Antarctica. The caldera of Deception Island provides considerably milder conditions than the frigid surrounding waters and it could be an ideal location for newly introduced species to become established.

These unique biotic communities on Earth are facing complex climatic and environmental changes. Terrestrial ecosystems in the Antarctic Peninsula Region (APR) have experienced the highest rate of climate warming and, being the most impacted by human activities, are facing the greatest risk of detrimental changes. This review provides an overview of the most recent findings on how biotic communities in terrestrial ecosystems of the Antarctic Peninsula Region (APR) are responding and will likely respond to further environmental changes and direct anthropogenic impacts. Knowledge gained from studies on relatively simple terrestrial ecosystems could be very useful in predicting what may happen in much more complex ecosystems in regions with less extreme temperature changes. The rapid warming of the APR has led to the retreat of glaciers, the loss of snow and permafrost and the increase of ice-free areas, with a consequent enhancement of soil-forming processes, biotic communities, and food web complexity. However, most human activity is concentrated in APR coastal ice-free areas and poses many threats to terrestrial ecosystems such as environmental pollution or disturbances to soil communities and wildlife. People who work or visit APR may inadvertently introduce alien organisms and/or spread native species to spatially isolated ice-free areas.

Location. Possession Island, Crozet archipelago (French sub-Antarctic islands). Methods. Single-species distribution models were used to explore the effect of high-resolution topoclimatic and human-related variables on the occurrence of six alien plants colonizing French sub-Antarctic islands. Furthermore, plant responses to human-related variables and the effect of those variables in interaction with plant traits were analysed by means of a multi-species distribution model. This allowed identifying functional features mediating the influence of human activities on the occurrence probability of alien plant species. Results. We observed two main invasion patterns: (a) species predicted to occur close to the introduction sites, whose occurrence probability appeared to be strongly affected by anthropogenic factors; and (b) species predicted to occur nearly everywhere on Possession Island, except in areas featuring particularly harsh climatic conditions. Differences in the influence of human-related variables on the occurrence of the alien species were mostly related to their life history, plant height and residence time, with perennial and low-statured species introduced earlier appearing less dependent on human-induced dispersal and disturbance. Conclusions. We conclude that both topoclimatic and anthropogenic factors affect plant invasion on sub-Antarctic islands. Specifically, species predicted to occur close to their introduction sites appear much more dependent on human presence and activity, potentially due to the lack of key functional traits allowing them to spread successfully across Possession Island under the harsh sub-Antarctic climate.

However, this may be due to an absence of information on impacts, including changing species occupancy and forecast occupancy, rather than lack of impact per se. Here we use the plant invaders on the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands (PEIs) and spatially explicit modeling of presence–absence survey data to demonstrate that the geographic extent of many invasives is increasing and is forecast to lead to occupancy of >60% of the islands’ surface area by 2060, with ongoing climate change. In keeping with theory, proximity to human activity, neighboring populations (i.e. propagule pressure) and residence time, along with more minor contributors such as elevation, explain >50% of the variation in the occupancy of each of the six main invasive species on the islands. Human disturbance and changing climates seem to have led to recent increases in the rate of range expansion. Our results suggest that impacts of island plant invaders may be more significant than previously estimated, largely owing to prior data deficiency. More specifically they also suggest that control plans for the PEI (and other Southern Ocean Islands, SOIS) should first target less widely distributed species, which are invasive elsewhere. They also indicate that for the other SOIS, and for Antarctica, surveillance and anticipatory control plans should be in place",,Journal Article,"Antarctic, Environmental change, Invasive alien species, Propagule pressure, 1105 Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, 2309 Nature and Landscape Conservation",,'Elsevier BV'

In this study, we collected air samples from 100 locations around the 21 Southern Ocean to analyze bacterial biodiversity in the circumpolar air around the Antarctic 22 continent as understanding dispersal processes is paramount to assessing the risks of 23 microbiological invasions. We also compared the Southern Ocean air bacterial biodiversity to other 24 non-polar ecosystems to identify the potential origin of these Southern Ocean air microorganisms. 25 The bacterial diversity in the air had both local and global origins and presented low richness overall 26 but high heterogeneity, compatible with a scenario whereby samples are composed of a suite of 27 different species in very low relative abundances. Only 4% of Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) 28 were identified in both polar and non-polar air masses, suggesting that the polar air mass over the 29 Southern Ocean can act as a selective dispersal filter. Furthermore, both microbial diversity and 30 community structure both varied significantly with meteorological data, suggesting that regional 31 bacterial biodiversity could be sensitive to changes in weather conditions, potentially altering the 32 existing pattern of microbial deposition in the Antarctic.3334 Keywords3536 Antarctica, Aerobiology, Dispersal, Bacteria, Biodiversity, Invasion, Climate Change3738 Introduction39 Parts of Antarctica are warming at record rates, affecting both ecosystems and associated 40 biota and processes (Convey & Peck, 2019, Pörtner et al., 2019, Clem et al., 2020). The resulting 41 changes are difficult to predict as the impact of climate change on these local communities and their 42 ecosystem functions are still not well defined. It has been predicted that anthropogenic activities 43 and climate change will weaken both biogeographic boundaries and dispersal barriers of terrestrial 44 and marine ecosystems, increasing the risks of biological invasions (Convey & Peck, 2019). 45 Although humans participate in the dispersal of non-indigenous microorganisms, the impact of 46 anthropogenic activities is still limited in Antarctica (Cowan et al., 2011) and aerial transport 47 remains the primary source of new biological input such as moss and lichen spores, near-48 microscopic fauna and microorganisms (Marshall et al., 1996; Smith et al., 2013, Barberán et al., 49 2014, Barberán et al., 2015, Smets et al., 2016, Maki et al., 2019). However, the contribution of 50 aerial dispersal in shaping the overall pattern of biodiversity and ecosystem function remains poorly 51 understood. 52 For Antarctic invasions (and ultimately colonisation), access might represent a particular 53 challenge as the continent is both geographically remote and air and water currents in the region 54 form a potential dispersal barrier around the continent. Indeed, it has been suggested that the 55 Antarctic Convergence zone within the Southern Ocean, and the resulting Antarctic circumpolar 56 vortex, as well as the ‘cyclone belt’ surrounding Antarctica (with commonly four or five distinct 57 cyclones effectively ‘following’ each other around the continent) can act as a dispersal barrier for 58 airborne organisms (Pearce et al., 2009, Womack et al., 2010, Archer et al., 2019, King-Miaow et 59 al., 2019, Uetake et al., 2020). Whether that is the case and the implication of a changing climate 60 on this potential dispersal barrier are yet to be determined (Womack et al., 2010). It is also worthy 61 of note that the large-scale atmospheric patterns around the continent are from west to east. As a 62 result, airborne organisms may circulate around the continent several times before moving further 63 south. 64 For decades, the focus has been on macro-organisms (Lonsdale, 1999) with only recent 65 interest for microbial invasions (Mallon et al., 2015, Kinnunen et al., 2016, Malard & Pearce, 2022). 66 This is largely because for a long time, ‘everything is everywhere, but the environment selects’ 67 (Bass Becking, 1934) led to the assumption that microorganisms lack the biogeographic patterns 68 necessary for differential distribution. Only the development of high throughput sequencing has 69 been able to provide overwhelming evidence that microorganisms do display specific 70 biogeographic distribution patterns (Tedersoo et al., 2014, Bahram et al., 2018, Delgado-Baquerizo 71 et al., 2018) suggesting the potential for dispersal limitation and that microbial invasions are likely 72 to be ecologically important, impacting the diversity and function of resident communities.73 Whether microbial biogeography in the atmosphere exists at all is still open to question and 74 requires further research. Indeed, little attention has been given to microbial diversity patterns in 75 the atmosphere as the environment has traditionally been regarded as a conduit rather than a habitat 76 (Wommack et al. 2010). Recent studies have begun addressing these issues in the atmosphere, 77 showing for example that marine bioaerosol communities can be distinct from those found in 78 adjacent terrestrial locations (Siefried et al. 2015). Overall, studies in other regions have shown that 79 patterns of microbial dispersal are predominantly local (Herbold et al., 2014) interspersed with 80 sporadic long-range events (Smith et al., 2013, Barberán et al., 2014, Barberán et al., 2015, 81 Crawford et al., 2017, Maki et al., 2019). If the aerial microbiology around the Antarctic follows 82 this pattern, it will have very important implications in terms of conservation and the maintenance 83 of the microbial biodiversity in the region. Indeed, lower environmental filtering due to the 84 weakening of dispersal barriers induced by climate change may support the transport and 85 establishment of cosmopolitan taxa, capable of long-distance dispersal, over more specialized and 86 endemic taxa and may support the invasion of non-indigenous taxa to the Antarctic. Therefore, 87 identifying the origin of incoming airborne microbes is essential to predict the potential impact of 88 their integration into local ecosystems. 89 Although it is now well established that microorganisms spread through the air, the process 90 is limited by survival (Cowan et al., 2011), which is likely to have represented a significant natural 91 barrier against this type of invasions in the past. However, whether microbial survival in air is to 92 change, or can change following rapid climate warming, remains to be determined. Microorganisms 93 are known to be metabolically active in the atmosphere (Tignat-Perrier et al., 2020). They 94 participate in cloud formation, impacting precipitation patterns through ice nucleation (Fröhlich-95 Nowoisky et al., 2016, Šantl-Temkiv et al., 2019); therefore, airborne microorganisms have 96 influence on cloud formation, radiation and precipitation (Sato & Inoue, 2021). The changing 97 climate leads to changes in the frequency, intensity, spatial extent, duration, and timing of extreme 98 weather and climate events in general (Seneviratne et al., 2021) and in particular also over the 99 Southern Ocean (Meucci et al., 2020, Hepworth et al., 2022). Moreover, persistent features that 100 strongly influence the atmospheric dynamics of the Southern Ocean change with a changing 101 climate, such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation (Cai et al., 2022) and intensification and 102 latitudinal shift of the westerly winds (Perren et al., 2020, Liang et al., 2021). Thus, understanding 103 the direct link between climatological conditions and biological dispersal is essential to determine 104 the rate of climate-driven ecological change worldwide and for the Antarctic, over the Southern 105 Ocean. Studies have already suggested that temperature, UV radiation, humidity and weather-106 related factors may impact atmospheric diversity elsewhere (Šantl-Temkiv et al., 2018, Tignat-107 Perrier et al., 2019) while others have found little to no correlation (Uetake et al., 2020), illustrating 108 the need for more global and standardised research in the field. 109 To answer these questions, the first step is to investigate the biodiversity of the atmosphere, 110 the factors that influence this aerial diversity and to identify potential dispersal barriers. To date, 111 the overwhelming picture emerging from the air sampled across the Antarctic is one of relatively 112 low biomass but high diversity across all samples (Busse et al., 2003, Pearce et al., 2009, Van Houdt 113 et al., 2009, Bottos et al., 2014, Herbold et al., 2014, Archer et al., 2019). However, the drivers of 114 this diversity and its origins remain elusive. 115 In this study, we collected air samples from 100 locations around the Southern Ocean and 116 its islands as well as seven concurrent precipitation samples. This included unique samples from 117 marine areas that are normally inaccessible as well as the sub- and peri-Antarctic islands. Focusing 118 on bacterial communities, we used this data to make two core comparisons: a) Southern Ocean 119 samples derived in this study with existing published sequences derived from different habitats 120 around the globe, and b) sequences obtained in this study combined to air sequences from other 121 studies and separated North and South of the Antarctic Convergence zone. The primary aim of this 122 study was to test the hypothesis that the Antarctic Convergence zone acts as a dispersal barrier, 123 limiting the risk of microbiological invasions to continental Antarctica. 124125 Results and Discussion126127 1. Which bacterial taxa dominate Southern Ocean Air?128 Southern Ocean air samples were collected between December 2016, and March 2017, 129 whilst the R/V Akademik Tryoshnikov circumnavigated the Antarctic continent on the Antarctic 130 Circumpolar Expedition (ACE) (Landwehr et al., 2021) [Figure 1, Supplementary Data 1]. A total 131 of 107 samples (± 19032 reads/sample) with 1013 assigned amplicon sequence variants were 132 identified in Antarctic air and precipitation samples. Overall, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, 133 Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla across all samples [Fig. 1]. These 134 phyla are consistent with other studies of global aerobiological biodiversity (DeLeon-Rodriguez et 135 al., 2013, Smith et al., 2013, Cuthbertson et al., 2017, Mayol et al., 2017, Els et al., 2019, Tignat-136 Perrier et al., 2019, Tignat-Perrier et al., 2020, Lang-Yona et al., 2022), including Antarctica 137 (Archer et al., 2019, Uetake et al., 2020). While these four phyla have been shown to dominate the 138 atmospheric diversity globally, many others have been identified, and across this study twenty-139 seven bacterial phyla were identified [Supplementary Data 2]. These included, for example, 140 Nitrospirota, Verrucomicrobia, Plantomycetes and Acidobacteria, which are important members of 141 most airborne communities (Bowers et al., 2009, Bowers et al., 2011, Šantl-Temkiv et al., 2018, 142 Els et al., 2019), including in Antarctica (Bottos et al., 2014, Uetake et al., 2020). The presence of 143 these phyla may also indicate the importance of the contribution from aquatic or soil bacterial 144 sources (DeLeon-Rodriguez et al., 2013, Uetake et al., 2020). 145 We also identified a total of 378 genera [Supplementary Data 2], notably Enhydrobacter 146 (Gammaproteobacteria, relative abundance: 4.8%), Psychrobacter (Gammaproteobacteria, relative 147 abundance: 3.7%), Staphylococcus (Firmicutes, relative abundance: 1.2%), Mesorhizobium 148 (Alphaproteobacteria, relative abundance: 1.2%) and Acinetobacter (Gammaproteobacteria, 149 relative abundance: 0.9%). These have all been identified in Antarctic air samples (Archer et al., 150 2019) and elsewhere (Els et al., 2019, Archer et al., 2020, Tignat-Perrier et al., 2020). While the 151 relative abundance of each genus is variable, consistent genera are identified in air samples globally. 152 For example, Enhydrobacter has recently been identified in the air over the Atlantic and Pacific 153 Oceans but not in the associated oceanic waters. Enhydrobacter has been proposed for a 154 reclassification to the family Rhodospirillaceae (purple non-sulfur bacteria, in the 155 Alphaproteobacteria), a family of phototrophic organisms. Lang-Yona et al. (2022) also found that 156 Massilia, Acinetobacter and Mesorhizobium were associated with oceanic air communities. Across 157 all aerobiology studies to date, it appears that there are consistent dominant phyla and genera, 158 suggesting that there may be a common aerial microbiome, but that abundance and diversity may 159 vary significantly by region (Archer et al., 2021 Preprint).160161162163164 Figure 1: Map of the air sampling locations, shaped by sample type and coloured by the origin of 165 the air mass (back trajectory) relative to the Antarctic Convergence.

The microbial taxa dominating Southern 167 Ocean (SO) air are highly variable with geographic location, even for consecutive samples and at 168 the Phylum level. 169170 2.  How does the Southern Ocean air biodiversity compare globally with other ecosystems?171 a. Alpha diversity 172 We compared the alpha diversity of the Southern Ocean air (SO air) and precipitation 173 samples to published sequences from air sampled from other locations (referred to as ‘global air’) 174 and both marine and terrestrial (ie. non-air) ecosystems [Fig. 2, Fig. S1]. Overall, the richness and 175 diversity were much lower in all air samples (mean air richness/diversity: 27.5-30.6/1.83-2.57) 176 when compared to soil and marine ecosystems (mean global soil richness/diversity: 560/5.5, mean 177 open ocean richness/diversity: 233/3.58). The Southern Ocean air diversity also showed a higher 178 heterogeneity (mean SO air Simpson index: 0.70) [Table S1] than other ecosystems. Globally, we 179 found that soil microbial richness and diversity tended to a maximum in temperate regions, 180 confirming a previously observed pattern (Bahram et al., 2018). Marine microbial biodiversity 181 tended to increase towards the poles, also a pattern that had previously been observed (Ladau et al., 182 2013). However, while air-borne microbial richness was relatively stable with latitude across the 183 globe, diversity decreased significantly with increasing latitude [Fig. 3]. Regionally, Uetake et al. 184 (2020) demonstrated a decrease in alpha diversity of airborne bacteria communities with increasing 185 latitude, from Australia to the Antarctic continent. We should note that the Arctic is not represented 186 in this comparison due to a lack of data availability from that region, and, as such, high latitude air 187 samples correspond only to the Southern Ocean air samples collected in our study. Whether this 188 pattern holds for the Arctic region is still to be determined. Overall, the decrease in diversity at high 189 latitudes was driven by the high unevenness of the airborne communities [Fig. 3]. Indeed, the 190 Simpson index indicated that some communities were very uneven, especially at the highest 191 latitudes, with one or few species largely dominating the communities [Fig. 3]. This variability of 192 SO air communities was also reflected in the community composition [Fig. 1, Fig. 4A] and is in 193 line with other highly variable airborne communities elsewhere (Lang-Yona et al., 2022)194195196197 Figure 2. Comparison of the alpha diversity of Southern Ocean air (SO Air, n=100) and 198 precipitation (SO Precipitation, n=7) to other global air samples (global air, n=98) and other non-199 air ecosystems including surface open ocean (n=123), surface coastal ocean (n= 7), global soils 200 (n=146), Arctic soils (n=43) and Antarctic soils (n=113)201202203204 Figure 3: Latitudinal distribution of the richness and diversity of air (n = 198), marine (n = 130) 205 and soil (n = 302) bacterial communities. The absolute latitude was used, merging northern and 206 southern latitudes. Second order polynomials fits are shown with R2 and associated p-values.207 b. Beta diversity208 We compared the beta diversity of global bacterial communities using non-metric 209 multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to view differences in community composition between sample 210 types [Fig. 4A]. The Antarctic soil communities were different from other soil communities and 211 presented lower richness and diversity than other soil samples [Fig. 2]. This was further observed 212 at the phylum level, with Antarctic soils harbouring more Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes [Fig. 213 4B]. Surface open ocean marine communities clustered away from coastal ocean marine 214 communities, primarily due to the high relative abundance of Cyanobacteria, which represented 215 over 50 % of the surface ocean communities. Global air communities clustered away from Southern 216 Ocean air communities, with Proteobacteria representing 75 % of the global air communities. Utake 217 et al. (2020) looking at global patterns of bacterial diversity in the air found a latitudinal 218 differentiation of composition at the phylum level. Here, we observed more Proteobacteria in global 219 air community samples while Southern Ocean air communities harboured more Firmicutes and 220 Bacteroidetes, known to form endospores protecting the genetic material of the bacteria (Martiny 221 et al., 2006, Filippidou et al., 2016). However, we observed a decrease in Firmicutes but increase 222 in Bacteroidetes with increasing latitude. While the difference in communities may reflect the 223 selection pressure of local environmental conditions, we cannot exclude the influence of different 224 sampling protocols and sequencing approaches on the community composition, despite the use of 225 the same primers. Overall, global air, marine and terrestrial communities were different from each 226 other (PERMANOVA, R2 = 0.14, p = 0.001), and Southern Ocean air communities were unique, 227 highly heterogeneous, and different from other airborne communities elsewhere PERMANOVA, 228 R2 = 0.08, p < 0.001).   229230231232 Figure 4. A. Visualization of community dissimilarity using non-metric multidimensional scaling 233 (NMDS) of the Bray-Curtis distance between air, marine, and soil bacterial communities. B. 234 Relative abundance of bacteria at the phylum level. 235236 c. Biomass237 In this study, 3,322,968 L of air was collected in total across an 85-day period. It contained 238 a total cell density as estimated by qPCR of the 16S rRNA gene of 7.5 x 102 cells m-3 and above. 239 Despite the comparative hostility of the environment, remoteness from traditionally recognised 240 sources of air-borne bacteria, apparent low levels of nutrients and desiccation, significant numbers 241 of bacteria were consistently found across the region. This is much lower than has been cited for 242 other locations around the globe. Indeed, studies have shown that global concentrations of bacteria 243 in the atmosphere generally range from 104 to 106 cells m-3 although these studies have showed that 244 the range of airborne microbial concentrations is far wider than this and is highly variable (Gandolfi 245 et al., 2013, Šantl-Temkiv et al., 2018, Maki et al., 2019, Tignat-Perrier et al., 2019). For example, 246 across nine global sampling sites, bacterial concentrations varied from 9.2 x 101 to 1.3 x 108 cells 247 m-3 with the lowest concentration recoded in Station Nord at the Villum research station 248 (Greenland) and the highest bacterial concentration recorded on the semi-arid plateau of Namco 249 (China) at over 4700m elevation (Tignat-Perrier et al., 2019). In Nuuk (Greenland), bacterial 250 concentrations of 1.3 × 103 ± 1.0 × 103 cells m-3 have been recorded (Šantl-Temkiv et al., 2018) 251 while bacterial concentration in free tropospheric air above the Alps ranges from 3.4 x 104 cells to 252 2.67 x 105 m-3 (Xia et al., 2014). Of particular relevance to this study, the average microbial 253 abundances in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) are quoted as ~ 1.9 × 104 bacteria m−3 (Mayol 254 et al. 2017).  Hence, in common with broad scale observed patterns in the higher animals and plants, 255 we observed a significant decrease in biomass with latitude. We can therefore conclude that the 256 total biomass in the atmosphere over the Southern Ocean is low, and between one to two orders of 257 magnitude lower than the biomass found elsewhere. This observation was consistent with the 258 abundance of fluorescent particles 0.00017-0.1201 m3, a previously used best estimate of biomass 259 in the air above the Southern Ocean (Moallemi et al. 2021).260261 3. How unique are Southern Ocean airborne communities?262 The Southern Ocean air and global air communities shared 4% of the total number of ASVs 263 combined totaling 139 shared ASVs [Fig. 5A], primarily Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and 264 Actinobacteria [Fig. 5B]. This result alone suggested that the air over the Southern Ocean does not 265 act as a strict dispersal barrier but a rather selective barrier to microorganisms entering the Antarctic 266 (since these common ASVs were identified in non-polar ecosystems). However, the relatively low 267 number in common strongly suggests that it could be acting as a selective dispersal filter. 268 Furthermore, although this is a relatively low number of ASVs, their mean relative abundance 269 across all samples was equivalent to 36 % of the communities. In comparison, the 788 ASVs unique 270 to the Southern Ocean air represented 34 % of the communities while the 2270 ASVs unique to the 271 global air also represented 30 % [Supplementary data 3]. In other words, about 1/3 appear 272 potentially restricted to the Southern Ocean, 1/3 appear potentially common to the rest of the globe 273 (except the Southern Ocean) and 1/3 appear cosmopolitan in terms of relative abundance. This 274 result highlights the presence of a low number of highly abundant taxa, and a high number of very 275 low abundance taxa in each community and confirms the very high variability in diversity discussed 276 previously in this study and observed by other studies and is important in terms of why microbial 277 biodiversity is important ie though environmental function and community resilience (via factors 278 such as functional gene redundancy).  279280281282283 Figure 5. A: number of ASVs (# ASVs) shared between global air and Southern Ocean air samples. 284 The percentage indicates the relative abundance (Rel. Ab.) represented by the number of ASVs 285 across all samples. B. Relative abundance of shared bacteria at the phylum level. 286287 This result is perhaps unsurprising, as core microbiomes are starting to emerge as a common 288 feature of microbiological biodiversity and biogeography studies worldwide. Els et al. (2019) 289 identified a core microbiome in free tropospheric air microbial community over Mount Sonnblick 290 in the Austrian Alps (3106 m above sea level) which consisted of 61 OTUs (11% of all the OTUs 291 they detected). Archer et al. (2019) found in a direct comparison that Antarctic non-native 292 assemblages shared only 5.7% of bacterial ASVs with markedly more diverse bioaerosols found in 293 New Zealand. In contrast, in this study, while 139 ASVs were shared between Southern Ocean air 294 and global air, we did not identify any ASV present in over 50 % of all air samples. The most 295 prevalent ASV shared by 25 % of all samples was classified as a Psychrobacter 296 (Gammaproteobacteria). They are aerobic, Gram-negative coccobacilli and most Psychrobacter 297 strains are psychrotrophic and can grow at 5 °C. Many strains are also radiation resistant, making 298 them well adapted to live in the air (Juni, 2015).    299 The 4% ASV similarity in polar and non-polar air were diverse in taxonomy including both 300 cosmopolitan species and extremophiles, most represented by only one sequence variant (where 301 more than one ASV, the number is indicated in parentheses). Of the 139 ASVs identified as present 302 in both Antarctic and non-Antarctic air, about 50% were attributable to specific environmental 303 species [Table 1]. 304305Notable characteristics  GenusUbiquitous to all ecosystems Pseudomonas (4), Brevundimonas (2)Cosmopolitan/ubiquitous in soils and/or waterAcinetobacter (6), Actinomyces, Flavobacterium (3) and related Sphingobacterium, Sphingobacteriaceae, Empedobacter, Massilia (3), Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum (3), Rhodococcus, Variovorax and Bacteroides (4)Identified in Freshwater Aeromonas, Brevundimonas (a Gram negative bacterium widely distributed in nature), Candidatus Limnoluna affiliated with the Phylum Actinobacteria, Candidatus Planktophila an actinobacterium representing one of the most important taxa in freshwater bacterioplankton, Caulobacter an aquatic bacterium that thrives in nutrient poor environments, Chryseobacterium (2), Enhydrobacter, Aquabacterium (2) and Rhodoferax (purple non-sulphur bacteria)Identified in air Enhydrobacter and AerococcusExtremophiles Shewanella, Psychrobacter, TepidomonasGram positive Blastococcus, Blastomonas, Brachybacterium, Carnobacterium, Corynebacterium (7) and ActinomycesFunctional (involved in the Nitrogen cycle)Ellin6067, Lentimicrobium, Noviherbaspirillum, Paracoccus, Burkholderia-Caballeronia-Paraburkholderia, BradyrhizobiumFunctional (Methylotrophic) MethyloteneraOther notable taxa (as not marine) Betaproteobacterium Malikia and Cornamonadaceae (3)306307 Table 1: A non-exhaustive list of the genera shared across all air samples and their ecosystem or 308 notable characteristics  309310 4. What is the role of the sub- and peri-Antarctic islands? 311 In this study, while most samples were collected aboard the ship (n=90) in the Southern 312 Ocean (SO air over ocean), samples (n=10) were also collected on land, on the Antarctic and sub-313 and peri-Antarctic islands (SO air over land). Despite the species richness of air over terrestrial and 314 marine environments being similar (ANOVA, p = 0.58), a significant difference was found in both 315 the Shannon and Simpson diversity indices between Southern Ocean air samples taken over marine 316 sites when compared to those taken over terrestrial sites [Fig. S2A]. Air communities were equally 317 rich but communities over oceans were very uneven compared to those taken over islands. The 318 difference in community composition between air samples was driven by the high variability of 319 communities over the Ocean [Fig. S2B]. In total, 689 ASVs were uniquely identified in SO air over 320 ocean while only 87 ASVs were unique to the air over land [Fig. S2C]. Furthermore, we observed 321 that each of the Islands had a distinct pattern of biodiversity in the air above them, suggesting that 322 each of the Islands in the Southern Ocean is unique [Fig. S3]. The pattern of aerial biodiversity 323 above the Islands of the Southern Ocean suggests that for the Southern Ocean at least, we can 324 probably discount the ‘air-bridge’ or ‘stepping-stone’ hypothesis, by which microbial biodiversity 325 does not reach the Antarctic continent by using islands as stepping-stones to reduce the effective 326 distance it is necessary to travel. It does, however, argue for the importance of conservation and 327 biosecurity measures tailored to each island location, since each island has its own unique 328 biodiversity (and hence influence on the environment around it). 329330 5. Which environmental factors affect Southern Ocean air bacterial communities?331 a. Pressure and cyclones332 We tested the influence of several key environmental and meteorological variables on the 333 diversity and community composition. Of the environmental parameters recorded at the time of 334 sampling (latitude, longitude, pressure, air temperature, relative humidity, average wind direction, 335 average wind speed, maximum wind speed, minimum wind speed, dew point, cloud level and solar 336 irradiance) and the atmospheric state over the five previous days of each sample (cold or warm 337 advected air, maximum potential temperature (theta), median latitude of air mass trajectory and the 338 presence or absence of a cyclone), none correlated with the aerial richness, diversity and evenness 339 of communities over the Southern Ocean [Table S2]. The random forest models did not explain any 340 of the variance observed in alpha diversity of these communities.  We can therefore tentatively 341 conclude that, at least in the immediate to short-term, the atmospheric environment itself is not the 342 primary determinant of the bacterial diversity of the air above the Southern Ocean.343 However, when investigating the effect of environmental parameters on community 344 composition, we found that the average maximum potential temperature (max theta indicates the 345 altitude of the originating air mass) and the air pressure resulted in a significant relationship with 346 community composition based on the permanova test [Table S2] and that the presence of cyclones 347 might increase the dissimilarity of communities [Figure 6A].  348349350351 Figure 6. A. Differences in community dissimilarity (Bray-Curtis) with the presence and absence 352 of cyclones. B. Linear model of community dissimilarity (Bray-Curtis) along the maximum 353 potential temperature of five-day back trajectories. C. Linear model of community dissimilarity 354 (Bray-Curtis) along the pressure gradient.355 High maximum potential temperature displayed somewhat higher community dissimilarity 356 [Fig. 6B]. As the potential temperature is a surrogate for the air mass origin, a high value suggests 357 that air masses have descended diabatically from the atmosphere further aloft, likely indicating their 358 origin from further north, perhaps the rest of the globe, hence the high variability in community 359 composition (although the data itself does not validate this interpretation). During low pressure 360 system situations, the community composition is more dissimilar and less stable [Fig. 6C]. Low 361 pressure systems are associated with cyclones, a frequent and highly characteristic feature of the 362 Southern Ocean (Papritz et al., 2014), and indeed we do see, albeit weak, a relationship between 363 higher community composition dissimilarity and cyclone presence [Fig. 6A].364 Clearly, an in-depth interpretation of this relationship is not possible with the observations 365 available. Indeed, we are still a very long way from an understanding of exactly how physical 366 parameters would mechanistically influence communities in the air. However, it is conceivable that 367 the cyclogenesis mixes air masses from different sources, leading to more diverse and variable 368 communities. 369 b. Precipitation370 In this study, we collected some precipitation samples during the rare events (n=7 371 precipitation events but only four days of precipitation in total) as well as air samples before or after 372 the event. Precipitation samples presented higher richness and communities were significantly 373 different from Southern Ocean air sampled on the same day [Fig. S4]. Precipitation samples were 374 largely dominated by Proteobacteria (Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria) while 375 concurrent air samples were more diverse with Firmicutes, Alpha- and Gamma- Proteobacteria and 376 Actinobacteria [Fig. S4]. Interestingly, 15 of the ASVs shared with the precipitation samples were 377 also identified in the 4% of shared ASVs between the polar and global air. These included 378 Enhydrobacter, Bradyrhizobium, Aquabacterium and Rhodoferax (Table 1). 379 Recent studies have shown that precipitation communities differ significantly from the air 380 communities at the time of precipitation events. For example, a study showed an increase in 381 bacterial concentrations in the air preceding a storm (Xia et al., 2013) and others have suggested 382 that microorganisms precipitated with fog, cloud water, snow, hail or rain differ in their species 383 composition from free tropospheric air masses and thus, do not mirror the air community structure 384 (Amato et al., 2017, Els et al., 2019, Evans et al., 2019). These studies suggest that snow or cloud 385 samples are not suitable proxies for free troposphere air microbiome composition.386 The implication of this observation is that precipitation provides increased biodiversity 387 input. As a result, precipitation patterns could influence microbial biodiversity in Southern Ocean 388 air through the addition of new diversity or through a change in the pattern of dominant groups. 389 This lends support to the idea that high altitude transfer is more important for biodiversity and 390 colonisation than low altitude transfer. Precipitation is formed mostly via the ice phase in clouds 391 (Korolev & Field, 2008), which may be the reason behind those biodiversity differences. The ice 392 phase in clouds relies on ice nucleating particles, and bioaerosols are prime ice nucleating particles 393 (INP) (Petters & Wright, 2015) Hence, precipitation samples might sub-select airborne 394 microorganisms that are good INP, for example, Gammaproteobacteria which are well known for 395 their ice nucleation activity (Failor et al., 2017). Given the formation level of clouds, they can both 396 originate from a source in the marine boundary layer and from aloft, the latter indicating long-range 397 transport. Although precipitation events are still relatively infrequent in this region, models suggest 398 that precipitations will increase, especially in the higher latitudes of the Southern Ocean (Liu & 399 Curry, 2010, Bracegirdle et al., 2020). 400 c. Other factors influencing communities401 Of particular significance, given the availability and use of back-track trajectory data, and 402 the idea that wind moves biodiversity from one location to another, was the apparent lack of 403 influence of either wind speed or, more importantly, wind direction. The impact of the wind on 404 aerial communities is still unclear as some studies have found some impacts of wind speed and 405 direction on communities (Tignat-Perrier et al., 2019, Tignat-Perrier et al., 2020), while others have 406 not (Uetake et al., 2020).  Furthermore, when considering the impact of wind speed and direction, 407 we must also consider temporal variables and spatial variables (as the vessel was moving) and 408 therefore, the situation is likely complex. Other environmental factors such as air temperature, UV 409 radiation or humidity have been suggested to have some influence on airborne communities (Šantl-410 Temkiv et al., 2018, Tignat-Perrier et al., 2019, Tignat-Perrier et al., 2020, Archer et al., 2021 411 Preprint) but this was not observed in the Southern Ocean. Overall, observations tend to vary by 412 study, likely reflecting the importance of local conditions at the time of sampling.413414 6. Where do Southern Ocean airborne bacteria likely originate? 415 Here, we used source-tracking to determine the potential ecosystem of origin of the ASVs 416 identified in the Southern Ocean air and precipitation samples. Of the 1013 Southern Ocean ASVs 417 identified, 584 were identified in the global database produced and therefore, had a potential origin 418 [Fig. 7A]. These contributed to 41 % of the total relative abundance across the whole database, 419 suggesting these were rather dominant taxa. Interestingly, we could not explain more than 30% of 420 the origin of the different Southern Ocean sample types [Fig. 7B], further highlighting the unique 421 ASVs identified in each group of samples. More taxa from other airborne sources were identified 422 in the precipitation samples while more taxa of terrestrial origin, especially Antarctic soils, were 423 identified in the sub- and peri-Antarctic islands’ air [Fig. 7C]. This result is an indication of the 424 stronger influence of local inputs in these samples, suggesting that islands have a strong influence 425 on the biodiversity of the air above them. Across the study, we found low numbers of ASVs of 426 marine origin [Fig. 7C-F], despite most of the sampling being conducted above the ocean. The 427 overall low input of ocean-associated microorganisms into the air globally (Archer et al., 2021 428 Preprint) may explain the limited influence of local ecosystems as sources of airborne 429 microorganisms over the oceans, as shown in this study and over the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans 430 (Mayol et al., 2017, Lang-Yona et al., 2022). 431 In the literature, the consensus about the origins of aerobiological diversity is a combination 432 of both, aerosolization of local material and long-distance transport, and differential source regions 433 and transport have been shown to influence microbial composition of the atmosphere (DeLeon-434 Rodriguez et al., 2013, Šantl-Temkiv et al., 2018). In oceanic air masses, microorganisms appear 435 to originate primarily from long-distance transport of terrestrial microorganisms, although large 436 uncertainties remain on the origins of ASVs. Only a standardised global investigation of microbial 437 communities in all ecosystems, as was started with the Earth Microbiome Project (Thompson et al., 438 2017), and the creation of an open-source database could shed light on the origin and dispersal 439 patterns of microorganisms in the air.  440441442443444 Figure 7: A. Euler diagram showing the number of ASVs (# ASVs) with an origin identified from 445 the global database and the relative abundance (Rel. Ab.). B. Mean potential origin of ASVs across 446 each Southern Ocean sample type. C-F. Mean origin of ASVs per sample type.  447448 7. Is the Antarctic Convergence Zone limiting bacterial dispersal to the Antarctic continent?449 Finally, we tested the hypothesis that the Antarctic Convergence might act as a dispersal 450 barrier (Pearce et al., 2009, Archer et al., 2019, King-Miaow et al., 2019, Uetake et al., 2020). To 451 this end, and to consider the dynamic movements of air masses rather than consider the convergence 452 as a static barrier, we identified the origin of the air mass using 5-day back track trajectories and 453 compared the median latitude of the air mass to the latitude of the Antarctic Convergence at the 454 relevant longitude. We compared global air samples (always considered north) and Southern Ocean 455 air samples north of the Antarctic Convergence to the Southern Ocean air samples collected south 456 of the convergence [Fig. 8]. We found differences in evenness and community composition, mainly 457 driven by the global air communities [Fig. 8B] as these differences were not apparent when 458 comparing only Southern Ocean air sample north and south of the convergence. The majority of 459 ASVs were unique to samples either north or south of the convergence, with 308 ASVs (9 % of the 460 total ASVs) shared between both [Fig. 8C]. Hence, the Antarctic Convergence does not appear to 461 be acting as a strict dispersal barrier but rather, the Southern Ocean may itself act as a selective 462 dispersal filter. The size of the Southern Ocean and remoteness of the continent might, in 463 themselves, be major filters of microorganisms unable to survive in the air longer than the minimum 464 time required to attain suitable ecosystems. Therefore, the Southern Ocean itself may be limiting 465 the dispersal of global airborne microorganisms to the Antarctic continent. 466467468469470471 Figure 8: Influence of the Antarctic Convergence Zone on microbial diversity above the Southern 472 Ocean, using global air samples as well as the samples collected during the ACE expedition around 473 the Southern Ocean.

Euler diagram showing the number of shared ASVs north and south of the Antarctic 476 Convergence ASVs (# ASVs), weighted by the relative abundance (Rel. Ab.). of ASVs in 477 percentages.  478479480481 Summary482 We investigated patterns of bacterial biodiversity in the air above the Southern Ocean and 483 provided evidence of low biomass, high diversity, heterogeneous, and unique communities from 484 both local and global origin. We found that air communities over the Southern Ocean and its islands 485 were significantly different from other ecosystems. However, these differences were not due to the 486 Antarctic Convergence Zone acting as a dispersal barrier, but rather the Southern Ocean acting as 487 a selective dispersal filter. We identified 139 ASVs that were previously identified in air samples 488 elsewhere, suggesting that these taxa may be pre-adapted to life in the atmosphere, efficient 489 dispersers and therefore, may form part of a potential aerobiome. 490 Significant differences in microbial air diversity following meteorological patterns (air 491 pressure, maximum potential temperature and the presence or absence of cyclones) and differences 492 in communities from precipitation events suggests that bacterial biodiversity may be sensitive to 493 changes in weather patterns that may result from climate change. These observations have 494 important implications as climate change is known to increase precipitation in the Arctic (Pörtner 495 et al., 2019). If they also increase in the Antarctic, it will lead to increased rates of microbial input 496 and potentially higher diversity and increased risks of biological invasions. In addition, as the region 497 warms, there will be more ice-free areas and free niches to colonise, potentially disrupting 498 ecosystem function. Therefore, changing weather patterns through climate change may increase the 499 frequency or the ability of microorganisms to reach Antarctica, illustrating the key role of the 500 atmosphere the biogeography of microorganisms in Antarctica. 501502 Materials and Methods503 ACE expedition and environmental data504 Antarctic air samples were collected aboard the R/V Akademik Tryoshnikov over an 85-505 day period between December 22nd, 2016, and March 16th, 2017, whilst the ship circumnavigated 506 the Antarctic continent. The circumnavigation began and ended at Cape Town with stops at Hobart, 507 Australia and Punta Arenas, Chile during the voyage [Figure 1A] (Landwehr et al., 2021). Location 508 via GPS co-ordinates and weather data were collected continuously throughout the voyage via a 509 Vaisala weather station aboard the ship, and included Latitude, Longitude, Average wind direction, 510 Average wind speed, Minimum wind speed, Maximum wind speed, Cloud level, Sky coverage, 511 Relative humidity, Temperature, Dew point, Pressure, Solar radiance and UV. 512 We used back trajectories (Thurnherr et al., 2020) calculated with the Lagrangian analysis 513 tool LAGRANTO (Sprenger & Wernli, 2015) based on wind fields from the operational analysis 514 data of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) to derive the 515 maximum potential temperature and median latitude within the five days prior of the air mass’ 516 arrival to the sampling location (see details in Schmale et al. (2019). We released 20 trajectories 517 from within the boundary layer around the ship position each hour and averaged those for the 518 duration of the sample collection. To classify whether a sample experienced air masses coming 519 primarily from north or south of the polar front, we compared the median latitude per sample to the 520 latitude of the Antarctic Convergence at the relevant longitude. The presence or absence of cyclones 521 and the location of the sampling in the warm or cold sector of a cyclone were derived from published 522 data sets (Thurnherr et al., 2020, Thurnherr & Wernli, 2020) and as described in Thurnherr et al. 523 (2021).524 Air and precipitation sample collection 525 Southern Ocean air samples were collected with sampling units set around the vessel to 526 reduce the influence of sea spray and potential human bacterial sources [Figure 1B]. Air samples 527 from terrestrial locations were collected at the sub-Antarctic islands of Kerguelen, Balleny, Crozet, 528 Bouvet and South Georgia and occasionally over the Antarctic continent. For terrestrial sites, 529 sampling units were positioned at a height of 1.5m to reduce the impact of local turbulence. 530 Dry samples were collected via a membrane filtration apparatus set up, whereby a Welch 531 WOB-L vacuum pump at a flow rate of 20L min-1 (Welch, Mt. Prospect, IL, USA) was connected 532 by tubing to a Sartorius filtration unit (Göttingen, Germany) containing a 47 mm × 0.2 μm pore 533 size cellulose nitrate membrane filter (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Chicago, IL, USA). Samples 534 were collected opportunistically for between one and 36 hours. Dry samples were supplemented 535 with a surface air system (SAS) sampler as backup. Wet samples were collected via a Bertin 536 Coriolis μ (Bertin Technologies, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France), where the collection cones 537 were filled with sterile DNase and RNase free H2O (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the sampler run 538 at a flow rate of 300 L m-1 for a duration of 50 minutes. Wet samples were supplemented with an 539 SKC sampler as backup. Precipitation samples were collected using a sterile funnel and filtered 540 onto nitrocellulose 0.22 µm filters (Merck  Millipore,  Germany) using a sterile filtration unit 541 (Sartorius, Groningen, Germany).  All samples were stored at -80 °C for the duration of the 542 expedition. 543 DNA extraction and 16S amplicon sequencing544 In total, 100 air samples and 7 precipitation samples were used in this study. Samples 545 collected on filter substrates were first dissected into quarters using an ethanol and flame sterilised 546 scalpel and a sterile petri dish in a Class II Microbiological safety cabinet. The dissected quarter 547 filter was then placed directly into a labelled bead tube for extraction. Water-based (Coriolis) 548 samples stored either in collection cones or falcon tubes were transferred to sterile 15 mL falcon 549 tubes and centrifuged for a duration of 20 minutes at 5000 g. Following centrifugation, the 550 supernatant was removed leaving 1 mL, within which the formed pellet was re-suspended. This 1 551 mL was then loaded directly into a labelled bead tube for extraction. Where samples contained more 552 than 15 mL liquid, they were combined after centrifugation, and the previous steps were repeated.553 DNA was extracted from each sample using the Qiagen PowerSoil kit (Qiagen, Hilden, 554 Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions and DNA extracts were stored at -20 °C. 16S 555 rRNA gene libraries were constructed using the universal primers 515F and 806R (Kozich et al., 556 2013) to amplify the V4 region. Amplicons were generated using a high-fidelity Accuprime DNA 557 polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), purified using the AMPure magnetic bead capture 558 kit (Agencourt, Beckman Coulter, MA, USA), and quantified using a QuantIT PicoGreen 559 fluorometric kit (Invitrogen). The purified amplicons were then pooled in equimolar concentrations 560 using a SequalPrep plate normalization kit (Invitrogen), and the final concentration of the library 561 was determined using a SYBR green quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay. Libraries were mixed with 562 Illumina-generated PhiX control libraries and our own genomic libraries and denatured using fresh 563 NaOH. The resulting amplicons were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq V2 (500 cycles).564 Quantitative-PCR565 DNA extraction of membrane filters was performed in a class II microbiological cabinet. 566 Filters were first cut in half (using a heat and UV sterilised scalpel) and sliced into thin ribbons to 567 avoid clustering. DNA extraction was performed using the DNAeasy Powersoil Pro kit (Qiagen, 568 Hilden, Germany) Amplification of the 16S rRNA gene was carried out using the primer pair 569 27fmod (AGRGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG) and 519Rmodbio (GWATTACCGCGGCKGCTG), 570 (Kozich et al. 2013) using a Step One Plus Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, 571 Massachusetts, United States). Each 20 µl qPCR reaction contained: 10 µl of 2X SYBR green 572 master mix, 2 µl ROX reference dye, 0.2 µM forward primer, 0.2 µM reverse primer, 5.6 µl DNA 573 and PCR grade water to 20 µl. The amplification method was as follows: initial 95°C for 5 mins, 574 then 40 cycles of (94°C for 15 seconds and 53°C for 30 seconds), followed by a melt curve. To 575 facilitate absolute quantification of the 16S rRNA gene, DNA extracts from E. coli k12 cells were 576 PCR amplified and ran on an agarose gel, with product bands cut out and weighed for DNA 577 extraction, using the Monarch Gel Extraction kit (New England Biolabs, Massachusetts, United 578 States). DNA concentration (ng µl-1) and purity (A260/280nm) were determined via the use of a 579 nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, United States). Gene copy 580 number was determined using the following equation: (Amount of DNA (ng) x 6.022 x1023)/(Gene 581 Length (bp)x 1 x 109 x 660), where 6.022 x1023 represents Avogadro’s Constant, 1 x109 a 582 conversion factor, and 660 is the average mass of 1 base pair (bp). A 1 in 10 serial dilution was 583 then performed to generate 16S rRNA standards containing known gene copy numbers ranging 584 from 1x107 to 1x101, which were run alongside air sample DNA and plotted to generate a standard 585 curve, facilitating the quantification of 16S rRNA gene copies in each sample.586 Bioinformatic processing587 The resulting amplicons were processed using the DADA2 pipeline (Callahan et al., 2016). 588 Forward and reverse read pairs were trimmed and filtered, with forward reads truncated at 230 bp 589 and reverse reads at 200 bp, no ambiguous bases allowed, and each read required to have <2 590 expected errors based on their quality scores. Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were 591 independently inferred from the forward and reverse reads of each sample using the run-specific 592 error rates. Reads were dereplicated, pairs were merged, and chimeras were removed from each 593 sample. Taxonomic assignment was performed against the SILVA v138 database (Quast et al., 594 2012, Yilmaz et al., 2014) using the implementation of the RDP (ribosomal database project) naive 595 Bayesian classifier (Wang et al., 2007). The decontam package (Davis et al., 2018) was used to 596 identify potential contaminants using the prevalence function. The ASV table was also manually 597 curated to discard ASVs present in the kit and MiSeq controls in higher abundance than in other 598 samples, leaving 107 samples (± 19032 reads/sample) with 1013 assigned ASVs. 599 Global database600 We produced a global 16S rRNA database of marine, soil and air samples using data 601 extracted from NCBI and based on studies using the primer set 515F-806R sequenced on Miseq 602 (Fig. S1, Table S3, ASV and taxonomy tables are available on FigShare). Each dataset from 603 individual studies was analysed separately using the DADA2 pipeline to independently calculate 604 the error rate and infer ASVs. Three types of datasets were encountered but all were processed with 605 the same criteria as the ACE samples, unless specified. Datasets with paired end reads (forward and 606 reverse) or datasets with forward reads only but with the same amplicon length as paired-end reads 607 were treated with the same criteria as the ACE samples. A few of the older datasets had forward 608 reads only with smaller amplicons and were truncated to 100 bp before proceeding with the DADA2 609 pipeline.610 The unique ASV tables and the final ACE table were merged using the 611 mergeSequenceTables function in DADA2 and identical ASVs were merged using the 612 collapseNoMismatch function in DADA2 with a minimum overlap of 90 bp, to ensure merging of 613 ASVs with different amplicon lengths. Only ASVs present in at least two samples were conserved. 614 Taxonomic assignment was performed against the SILVA v138 database (Quast et al., 2012, 615 Yilmaz et al., 2014) using the implementation of the RDP naive Bayesian classifier (Wang et al., 616 2007). 617 Statistical analyses 618 All statistical analyses were performed in the R environment using primarily a combination 619 of the phyloseq (McMurdie & Holmes, 2013) and vegan (Dixon, 2003), and visualised using 620 ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016). 621 For the global comparison, alpha diversity of all samples was computed in phyloseq with 622 the plot_richness function and ANOVA with Tukey’s honest significant difference (HSD) tests 623 were used to compare differences between sample types. Linear models with second order 624 polynomials were used to evaluate latitudinal associations with alpha diversity. For beta diversity, 625 sample counts were transformed to proportions, the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix was computed 626 and visualised using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). A PERMANOVA with the 627 adonis function was used compare beta diversity between sample types.628 Focusing on the Southern Ocean air (ACE expedition) samples, we compared marine air, 629 terrestrial air and precipitation samples. Alpha diversity was computed with the plot_richness 630 function and was compared between sample types using ANOVA with Tukey’s honest significant 631 difference (HSD) tests. Linear regressions were computed to evaluate relationships between 632 environmental variables and alpha diversity. We also used random forest models to identify the 633 most important variables associated with the alpha diversity of air communities. The random forest 634 (RF) models were computed using the rfPermute function with 5000 permutations and 5000 trees 635 in the rfPermute package (Archer & Archer, 2020). For beta diversity, sample counts were 636 transformed to proportions, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix was computed and visualised using 637 non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). A PERMANOVA with the adonis function was 638 used compare beta diversity between sample types and to identify associations with environmental 639 variables. The ps_euler function from the MicEco (Russel, 2020) package was used to identify 640 shared ASVs between groups of interests and produce venn diagrams. 641 Finally, we used the FEAST package (Shenhav et al., 2019) for the source tracking analysis. 642 To identify the potential origin of Antarctic air ASVs, we used the global database as sources of 643 ASVs and the ACE samples as sink. Differences between source origin and Southern Ocean sample 644 types were tested with ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD tests. Finally, the ps_euler function was used to 645 identify the potential aerobiome shared between the Southern Ocean and global air samples. 646647648 References649650 Amato P, Joly M, Besaury L, Oudart A, Taïb N, Moné AI, Deguillaume L, Delort A-M & Debroas 651 D (2017) Active microorganisms thrive among extremely diverse communities in cloud water.

Introduction Parts of Antarctica are warming at record rates, affecting both eco-systems and associated biota and processes (Convey and Peck, 2019, Pörtner et al., 2019, Clem et al., 2020). The resulting changes are difficult to predict as the impact of climate change on these local com-munities and their ecosystem functions are still not well defined. It has been predicted that anthropogenic activities and climate change will weaken both biogeographic boundaries and dispersal barriers of terrestrial and marine ecosystems, increasing the risks of biological in-vasions (Convey and Peck, 2019). Although humans participate in the dispersal of non-indigenous microorganisms, the impact of anthropo-genic activities is still limited in Antarctica (Cowan et al., 2011) and aerial transport remains the primary source of new biological input such as moss and lichen spores, near-microscopic fauna and microorganisms (Marshall, 1996; Marshall, 1997; Marshall and Convey, 1997; Smith et al., 2013, Barberán et al., 2014, Barberán et al., 2015, Smets et al., 2016, Maki et al., 2019). However, the contribution of aerial dispersal in shaping the overall pattern of biodiversity and ecosystem function re-mains poorly understood. For Antarctic invasions (and ultimately colonisation), access might represent a particular challenge as the continent is both geographically remote and air and water currents in the region form a potential dispersal barrier around the continent. Indeed, it has been suggested that the Antarctic Convergence Zone within the Southern Ocean, and the resulting Antarctic circumpolar vortex, as well as the ‘cyclone belt’ surrounding Antarctica (with commonly four or five distinct cyclones effectively ‘following’ each other around the continent) can act as a dispersal barrier for airborne organisms (Pearce et al., 2009, Womack et al., 2010, Archer et al., 2019, King-Miaow et al., 2019, Uetake et al., * Corresponding authors at: Department of Applied Sciences, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Northumbria University, NEwcastle-upon-Tyne NE1 8ST, United Kingdom (D.A.

Whether this is the case and the implications of a changing climate on this potential dispersal barrier are yet to be determined (Womack et al., 2010). It is also worthy of note that the large-scale at-mospheric patterns around the continent are from west to east. As a result, airborne microorganisms may circulate around the continent several times before moving further south. For decades, the focus has been on microorganisms (Lonsdale, 1999) with only recent interest in microbial invasions (Mallon et al., 2018; Kinnunen et al., 2016; Malard and Pearce, 2022). This is largely because for a long time, ‘everything is everywhere, but the environment selects’ (Bass Becking, 1934) led to the assumption that microorganisms lack the biogeographic patterns necessary for differential distribution. Only the development of high throughput sequencing has been able to provide overwhelming evidence that microorganisms do display specific biogeographic distribution patterns (Tedersoo et al., 2014; Bahram et al., 2018; Delgado-Baquerizo et al., 2018) suggesting the potential for dispersal limitation and that microbial invasions are likely to be ecologically important, impacting the diversity and function of resident communities. Whether microbial biogeography in the atmosphere exists at all is still open to question and requires further research. Indeed, little attention has been given to microbial diversity patterns in the atmo-sphere as the environment has traditionally been regarded as a conduit rather than a habitat (Womack et al., 2010). Recent studies have begun addressing these issues in the atmosphere, showing for example that marine bioaerosol communities can be distinct from those found in adjacent terrestrial locations (Seifried et al., 2015). Overall, studies in other regions have shown that patterns of microbial dispersal are pre-dominantly local (Herbold et al., 2014) interspersed with sporadic long- range events (Smith et al., 2013, Barberán et al., 2014, Barberán et al., 2015, Crawford et al., 2017, Maki et al., 2019). If the aerial microbi-ology around the Antarctic follows this pattern, it will have very important implications in terms of conservation and the maintenance of microbial biodiversity in the region. Indeed, lower environmental filtering due to the weakening of dispersal barriers induced by climate change may support the transport and establishment of cosmopolitan taxa, capable of long-distance dispersal, over more specialized and endemic taxa and may support the invasion of non-indigenous taxa to the Antarctic. Therefore, identifying the origin of incoming airborne microbes is essential to predict the potential impact of their integration into local ecosystems. Although it is now well established that microorganisms spread through the air, the process is limited by survival (Cowan et al., 2011), which is likely to have represented a significant natural barrier against this type of invasions in the past. However, whether microbial survival in air is to change, or can change following rapid climate warming, re-mains to be determined. Microorganisms are known to be metabolically active in the atmosphere (Tignat-Perrier et al., 2020a,b). They partici-pate in cloud formation, impacting precipitation patterns through ice nucleation (Fröhlich-Nowoisky et al., 2016, Sǎntl-Temkiv et al., 2019); therefore, airborne microorganisms can have an influence on cloud formation, radiation and precipitation (Sato and Inoue, 2021). The changing climate leads to changes in the frequency, intensity, spatial extent, duration, and timing of extreme weather and climate events in general (Seneviratne et al., 2021) and in particular also over the Southern Ocean (Meucci et al., 2020, Hepworth et al., 2022). Moreover, persistent features that strongly influence the atmospheric dynamics of the Southern Ocean change with a changing climate, such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation (Cai et al., 2022) and the intensification and lat-itudinal shift of westerly winds (Perren et al., 2020, Liang et al., 2021). Thus, understanding the direct link between climatological conditions and biological dispersal is essential to determine the rate of climate- driven ecological change worldwide and for the Antarctic, over the Southern Ocean. Studies have already suggested that temperature, UV radiation, humidity and weather-related factors may impact atmo-spheric diversity elsewhere (Šantl-Temkiv et al., 2018, Tignat-Perrier et al., 2019) while others have found little to no correlation (Uetake et al., 2020), illustrating the need for more global and standardised research in the field. To answer these questions, the first step is to investigate the biodi-versity of the atmosphere, the factors that influence this aerial diversity and to identify potential dispersal barriers. To date, the overwhelming picture emerging from the air sampled across the Antarctic is one of relatively low biomass but high diversity across all samples (Busse et al., 2003, Pearce et al., 2009, Van Houdt et al., 2009, Bottos et al., 2014, Herbold et al., 2014, Archer et al., 2019). However, the drivers of this diversity and its origins remain elusive. In this study, we collected air samples from 100 locations around the Southern Ocean and its islands as well as seven concurrent precipitation samples. This included unique samples from marine areas that are normally inaccessible as well as the sub- and peri-Antarctic islands. Focusing on bacterial communities, we used this data to make two core comparisons: a) Southern Ocean samples derived in this study with existing published sequences derived from different habitats around the globe, and b) sequences obtained in this study combined with air se-quences from other studies and separated North and South of the Ant-arctic Convergence Zone. The primary aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the Antarctic Convergence zone acts as a dispersal bar-rier, limiting the risk of microbiological invasions to continental Antarctica. 2. Results and discussion 2.1. Which bacterial taxa dominate Southern Ocean Air? Southern Ocean air samples were collected between December 2016, and March 2017, whilst the R/V Akademik Tryoshnikov circum-navigated the Antarctic continent on the Antarctic Circumpolar Expe-dition (ACE) (Landwehr et al., 2021) [Fig. 1, Supplementary Data 1]. A total of 107 samples (±19,032 reads/sample) with 1013 assigned amplicon sequence variants were identified in Antarctic air and pre-cipitation samples. Overall, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla across all samples [Fig. 1]. These phyla are consistent with other studies of global aero-biological biodiversity (DeLeon-Rodriguez et al., 2013, Smith et al., 2013, Cuthbertson et al., 2017, Mayol et al., 2017, Els et al., 2019a,b, Tignat-Perrier et al., 2019, Tignat-Perrier et al., 2020a,b, Lang-Yona et al., 2022), including Antarctica (Archer et al., 2019, Uetake et al., 2020). While these four phyla have been shown to dominate the atmo-spheric diversity globally, many others have been identified, and across this study twenty-seven bacterial phyla were identified [Supplementary Data 2]. These included, for example, Nitrospirota, Verrucomicrobia, Plantomycetes and Acidobacteria, which are important members of most airborne communities (Bowers et al., 2009, Bowers et al., 2011, Šantl-Temkiv et al., 2018, Els et al., 2019a,b), including in Antarctica (Bottos et al., 2014, Uetake et al., 2020). The presence of these phyla may also indicate the importance of the contribution from aquatic or soil bacterial sources (DeLeon-Rodriguez et al., 2013, Uetake et al., 2020). We also identified a total of 378 genera [Supplementary Data 2], notably Enhydrobacter (Gammaproteobacteria, relative abundance: 4.8 %), Psychrobacter (Gammaproteobacteria, relative abundance: 3.7 %), Staphylococcus (Firmicutes, relative abundance: 1.2 %), Mesorhizobium (Alphaproteobacteria, relative abundance: 1.2 %) and Acinetobacter (Gammaproteobacteria, relative abundance: 0.9 %). These have all been identified in Antarctic air samples (Archer et al., 2019) and elsewhere (Els et al., 2019a,b, Archer et al., 2020, Tignat-Perrier et al., 2020a,b). While the relative abundance of each genus is variable, consistent genera are identified in air samples globally. For example, Enhydrobacter has recently been identified in the air over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans but not in the associated oceanic waters. Enhydrobacter has been proposed for a reclassification to the family Rhodospirillaceae (purple non-sulfur bacteria, in the Alphaproteobacteria), a family of L.A. Malard et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Environment International 169 (2022) 1074923phototrophic organisms. Lang-Yona et al. (2022) also found that Mas-silia, Acinetobacter and Mesorhizobium were associated with oceanic air communities. Across all aerobiology studies to date, it appears that there are consistent dominant phyla and genera, suggesting that there may be a common aerial microbiome, but that abundance and diversity may vary significantly by region (Archer et al., 2021 Preprint). 2.2. How does the Southern Ocean air biodiversity compare globally with other ecosystems? 2.2.1. Alpha diversity We compared the alpha diversity of the Southern Ocean air (SO air) and precipitation samples to published sequences from air sampled from other locations (referred to as ‘global air’) and both marine and terres-trial (ie. non-air) ecosystems [Fig. 2, Fig. S1]. Overall, the richness and diversity were much lower in all air samples (mean air richness/di-versity: 27.5–30.6/1.83–2.57) when compared to soil and marine eco-systems (mean global soil richness/diversity: 560/5.5, mean open ocean richness/diversity: 233/3.58). The Southern Ocean air diversity also showed a higher heterogeneity (mean SO air Simpson index: 0.70) [Table S1] than other ecosystems. Globally, we found that soil microbial richness and diversity tended to a maximum in temperate regions, confirming a previously observed pattern (Bahram et al., 2018). Marine microbial biodiversity tended to increase towards the poles, also a pattern that had previously been observed (Ladau et al., 2013). How-ever, while air-borne microbial richness was relatively stable with lati-tude across the globe, diversity decreased significantly with increasing latitude [Fig. 3]. Regionally, Uetake et al. (2020) demonstrated a decrease in alpha diversity of airborne bacteria communities with increasing latitude, from Australia to the Antarctic continent. We should note that the Arctic is not represented in this comparison due to a lack of data availability from that region, and, as such, high latitude air samples correspond only to the Southern Ocean air samples collected in our study. Whether this pattern holds for the Arctic region is still to be determined. Overall, the decrease in diversity at high latitudes was driven by the high unevenness of the airborne communities [Fig. 3]. Indeed, the Simpson index indicated that some communities were very uneven, especially at the highest latitudes, with one or few species largely dominating the communities [Fig. 3]. This variability of SO air communities was also reflected in the community composition [Fig. 1, Fig. 4A] and is in line with other highly variable airborne communities elsewhere (Lang-Yona et al., 2022). 2.2.2. Beta diversity We compared the beta diversity of global bacterial communities using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to view differences in community composition between sample types [Fig. 4A]. The Ant-arctic soil communities were different from other soil communities and presented lower richness and diversity than other soil samples [Fig. 2]. This was further observed at the phylum level, with Antarctic soils harbouring more Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes [Fig. 4B]. Surface open ocean marine communities clustered away from coastal ocean marine communities, primarily due to the high relative abundance of Cyanobacteria, which represented over 50 % of the surface ocean communities. Global air communities clustered away from Southern Ocean air communities, with Proteobacteria representing 75 % of the global air communities. Uetake et al. (2020) looking at global patterns of bacterial diversity in the air found a latitudinal differentiation of composition at the phylum level. Here, we observed more Proteobac-teria in global air community samples while Southern Ocean air com-munities harboured more Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, known to form endospores protecting the genetic material of the bacteria (Martiny et al., 2006, Filippidou et al., 2016). However, we observed a decrease in Firmicutes but increase in Bacteroidetes with increasing latitude. While the difference in communities may reflect the selection pressure of local environmental conditions, we cannot exclude the influence of different sampling protocols and sequencing approaches on the community composition, despite the use of the same primers. Overall, global air, marine and terrestrial communities were different from each other (PERMANOVA, R2 = 0.14, p = 0.001), and Southern Ocean air com-munities were unique, highly heterogeneous, and different from other airborne communities elsewhere PERMANOVA, R2 = 0.08, p < 0.001). Fig. 1. Map of the air sampling locations, shaped by sample type and coloured by the origin of the air mass (back trajectory) relative to the Antarctic Convergence Zone. The relative abundance of bacterial taxa is given at the phylum level in the order of sampling. The microbial taxa dominating Southern Ocean (SO) air are highly variable with geographic location, even for consecutive samples and at the Phylum level. L.A. Malard et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Environment International 169 (2022) 10749242.2.3. Biomass In this study, 3,322,968 L of air was collected in total across an 85- day period. It contained a total cell density as estimated by qPCR of the 16S rRNA gene of 7.5 × 102 cells m− 3 and above. Despite the comparative hostility of the environment, remoteness from traditionally recognised sources of air-borne bacteria, apparent low levels of nutrients and desiccation, significant numbers of bacteria were consistently found across the region. This is much lower than has been cited for other lo-cations around the globe. Indeed, studies have shown that global con-centrations of bacteria in the atmosphere generally range from 104 to 106 cells m− 3 although these studies also showed that the range of airborne microbial concentrations is far wider than this and is highly variable (Gandolfi et al., 2013; Šantl-Temkiv et al., 2018; Maki et al., 2019; Tignat-Perrier et al., 2019). For example, across nine global sampling sites, bacterial concentrations varied from 9.2 × 101 to 1.3 ×108 cells m− 3 with the lowest concentration recoded in Station Nord at the Villum research station (Greenland) and the highest bacterial con-centration recorded on the semi-arid plateau of Namco (China) at over 4700 m elevation (Tignat-Perrier et al., 2019). In Nuuk (Greenland), bacterial concentrations of 1.3 × 103 ± 1.0 × 103 cells m− 3 have been recorded (Šantl-Temkiv et al., 2018) while bacterial concentration in free tropospheric air above the Alps ranges from 3.4 × 104 cells to 2.67 × 105 m− 3 (Xia et al., 2013). Of particular relevance to this study, the average microbial abundances in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) are quoted as ~1.9 × 104 bacteria m− 3 (Mayol et al., 2017). Hence, in common with broad scale observed patterns in the higher animals and plants, we observed a significant decrease in biomass with latitude. We can therefore conclude that the total biomass in the atmosphere over the Southern Ocean is low, and between one to two orders of magnitude lower than the biomass found elsewhere. This observation was consis-tent with the abundance of fluorescent particles 0.00017–0.1201 m3, a previously used best estimate of biomass in the air above the Southern Ocean (Moallemi et al., 2021). 2.3. How unique are Southern Ocean airborne communities? The Southern Ocean air and global air communities shared 4 % of the total number of ASVs combined totaling 139 shared ASVs [Fig. 5A], primarily Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria [Fig. 5B]. This result alone suggested that the air over the Southern Ocean does not act Fig. 2. Comparison of the alpha diversity of Southern Ocean air (SO Air, n = 100) and precipitation (SO Precipitation, n = 7) to other global air samples (global air, n = 98) and other non-air ecosystems including surface open ocean (n = 123), surface coastal ocean (n = 7), global soils (n = 146), Arctic soils (n = 43) and Antarctic soils (n = 113). L.A. Malard et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Environment International 169 (2022) 1074925as a strict dispersal barrier but a rather selective barrier to microor-ganisms entering the Antarctic (since these common ASVs were identi-fied in non-polar ecosystems). However, the relatively low number in common strongly suggests that it could be acting as a selective dispersal filter. Furthermore, although this is a relatively low number of ASVs, their mean relative abundance across all samples was equivalent to 36 % of the communities. In comparison, the 788 ASVs unique to the Southern Ocean air represented 34 % of the communities while the 2270 ASVs unique to the global air also represented 30 % [Supplementary data 3]. In other words, about 1/3 appear potentially restricted to the Southern Ocean, 1/3 appear potentially common to the rest of the globe (except the Southern Ocean) and 1/3 appear cosmopolitan in terms of relative abundance. This result highlights the presence of a low number of highly abundant taxa, and a high number of very low abundance taxa in each community, and confirms the very high variability in diversity discussed previously in this study (and observed by other studies) and is important in terms of why microbial biodiversity is important ie though environ-mental function and community resilience (via factors such as functional gene redundancy). This result is perhaps unsurprising, as core microbiomes are starting to emerge as a common feature of microbiological biodiversity and biogeography studies worldwide. Els et al. (2019a,b) identified a core microbiome in free tropospheric air microbial community over Mount Sonnblick in the Austrian Alps (3106 m above sea level) which consisted of 61 OTUs (11 % of all the OTUs they detected). Archer et al. (2019) found in a direct comparison that Antarctic non-native assemblages shared only 5.7 % of bacterial ASVs with markedly more diverse bio-aerosols found in New Zealand. In contrast, in this study, while 139 ASVs were shared between Southern Ocean air and global air, we did not identify any ASV present in over 50 % of all air samples. The most prevalent ASV shared by 25 % of all samples was classified as a Psy-chrobacter (Gammaproteobacteria). They are aerobic, Gram-negative coccobacilli and most Psychrobacter strains are psychrotrophic and can grow at 5 ◦C. Many strains are also radiation resistant, making them well adapted to living in the air (Juni, 2015). The 4 % ASV similarity in polar and non-polar air were diverse in taxonomy including both cosmopolitan species and extremophiles, most represented by only one sequence variant (where more than one ASV, the number is indicated in parentheses). Of the 139 ASVs identified as present in both Antarctic and non-Antarctic air, about 50 % were attributable to specific environmental locations [Table 1]. Fig. 3.

Malard et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Environment International 169 (2022) 10749262.4. What is the role of the sub- and peri-Antarctic islands? In this study, while most samples were collected aboard the ship (n = 90) in the Southern Ocean (SO air over ocean), samples (n = 10) were also collected on land, on the Antarctic and both sub- and peri-Antarctic islands (SO air over land). Despite the species richness of air over terrestrial and marine environments being similar (ANOVA, p = 0.58), a significant difference was found in both the Shannon and Simpson di-versity indices between Southern Ocean air samples taken over marine sites when compared to those taken over terrestrial sites [Fig. S2A]. Air communities were equally rich but communities over oceans were very uneven compared to those taken over islands. The difference in com-munity composition between air samples was driven by the high vari-ability of communities over the Ocean [Fig. S2B]. In total, 689 ASVs were uniquely identified in SO air over ocean while only 87 ASVs were unique to the air over land [Fig. S2C]. Furthermore, we observed that each of the islands had a distinct pattern of biodiversity in the air above them, suggesting that each of the islands in the Southern Ocean is unique [Fig. S3]. The pattern of aerial biodiversity above the islands of the Southern Ocean suggests that for the Southern Ocean at least, we can probably discount the ‘air-bridge’ or ‘stepping-stone’ hypothesis, by which microbial biodiversity might reach the Antarctic continent by using islands as stepping-stones to reduce the effective distance it is necessary to travel. It does, however, argue for the importance of con-servation and biosecurity measures tailored to each island location, since each island has its own unique biodiversity (and hence influence on the environment around it).

Relative abundance of bacteria at the phylum level. L.A. Malard et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Environment International 169 (2022) 10749272.5. Which environmental factors affect Southern Ocean air bacterial communities? 2.5.1. Pressure and cyclones We tested the influence of several key environmental and meteoro-logical variables on both the diversity and community composition. Of the environmental parameters recorded at the time of sampling (lati-tude, longitude, pressure, air temperature, relative humidity, average wind direction, average wind speed, maximum wind speed, minimum wind speed, dew point, cloud level and solar irradiance) and the at-mospheric state over the five previous days of each sample (cold or warm advected air, maximum potential temperature (theta), median latitude of air mass trajectory and the presence or absence of a cyclone), none correlated with the aerial richness, diversity and evenness of communities over the Southern Ocean [Table S2]. The random forest models did not explain any of the variance observed in alpha diversity of these communities. We can therefore tentatively conclude that, at least in the immediate to short-term, the atmospheric environment itself is not the primary determinant of the bacterial diversity of the air above the Southern Ocean. However, when investigating the effect of environmental parameters on community composition, we found that the average maximum po-tential temperature (max theta indicates the altitude of the originating air mass) and the air pressure resulted in a significant relationship with community composition based on the PERMANOVA test [Table S2] and that the presence of cyclones might increase the dissimilarity of com-munities [Fig. 6A]. High maximum potential temperature displayed somewhat higher community dissimilarity [Fig. 6B]. As the potential temperature is a surrogate for the air mass origin, a high value suggests that air masses have descended diabatically from the atmosphere further aloft, likely indicating their origin from further north, perhaps the rest of the globe, hence the high variability in community composition (although the data itself does not validate this interpretation). During low pressure system situations, the community composition is more dissimilar and less stable [Fig. 6C]. Low pressure systems are associated with cyclones, a frequent and highly characteristic feature of the Southern Ocean (Papritz et al., 2014), and indeed we do see, albeit weak, a relationship between higher community composition dissimilarity and cyclone presence [Fig. 6A]. Clearly, an in-depth interpretation of this relationship is not possible with the observations available. Indeed, we are still a very long way from an understanding of exactly how physical parameters would mechanistically influence communities in the air. However, it is conceivable that the cyclogenesis mixes air masses from different sour-ces, leading to more diverse and variable communities. 2.5.2. Precipitation In this study, we collected some precipitation samples during the rare events (n = 7 precipitation events but only four days of precipitation in total) as well as air samples before or after the event. Precipitation samples presented higher richness and communities were significantly different from Southern Ocean air sampled on the same day [Fig. S4]. Precipitation samples were largely dominated by Proteobacteria (Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria) while concurrent air samples were more diverse with Firmicutes, Alpha- and Gamma- Pro-teobacteria and Actinobacteria [Fig. S4]. Interestingly, 15 of the ASVs shared with the precipitation samples were also identified in the 4 % of shared ASVs between the polar and global air. These included Enhy-drobacter, Bradyrhizobium, Aquabacterium and Rhodoferax (Table 1). Recent studies have shown that precipitation communities differ significantly from the air communities at the time of precipitation Fig. 5.

Environment International 169 (2022) 1074928events. For example, a study showed an increase in bacterial concen-tration in the air preceding a storm (Xia et al., 2013) and others have suggested that microorganisms precipitated with fog, cloud water, snow, hail or rain differ in their species composition from free tropospheric air masses and thus, do not mirror the air community structure (Amato et al., 2017, Els et al., 2019a,b, Evans et al., 2019). Hence, these studies suggest that snow or cloud samples are not suitable proxies for free troposphere air microbiome composition. The implication of this observation is that precipitation provides increased biodiversity input. As a result, precipitation patterns could influence microbial biodiversity in Southern Ocean air through the addition of new diversity or through a change in the pattern of dominant groups. This lends support to the idea that high altitude transfer is more important for biodiversity and colonisation than low altitude transfer. Precipitation is formed mostly via the ice phase in clouds (Korolev and Field, 2008), which may be the reason behind those biodiversity dif-ferences. The ice phase in clouds relies on ice nucleating particles, and bioaerosols are prime ice nucleating particles (INP) (Petters and Wright, 2015) Hence, precipitation samples might sub-select airborne microor-ganisms that are good INP, for example, Gammaproteobacteria which are well known for their ice nucleation activity (Failor et al., 2017). Given the formation level of clouds, they can both originate from a source in the marine boundary layer and from aloft, the latter indicating long-range transport. Although precipitation events are still relatively infrequent in this region, models suggest that precipitations will in-crease, especially in the higher latitudes of the Southern Ocean (Liu and Curry, 2010, Bracegirdle et al., 2020). 2.5.3. Other factors influencing communities Of particular significance given the availability and use of back-track trajectory data, and the idea that wind moves biodiversity from one location to another, was the apparent lack of influence of either wind speed or, more importantly, wind direction. The impact of the wind on aerial communities is still unclear as some studies have found some impacts of wind speed and direction on communities (Tignat-Perrier et al., 2019, Tignat-Perrier et al., 2020a,b), while others have not (Uetake et al., 2020). Furthermore, when considering the impact of wind speed and direction, we must also consider temporal variables and spatial variables (as the vessel was moving) and therefore, the situation is likely complex. Other environmental factors such as air temperature, UV radiation or humidity have been suggested to have some influence on airborne communities (Šantl-Temkiv et al., 2018, Tignat-Perrier et al., 2019, Tignat-Perrier et al., 2020a,b, Archer et al., 2021 Pre-print) but this was not observed for the Southern Ocean. Overall, ob-servations tend to vary by study, likely reflecting the importance of local conditions at the time of sampling. 2.6. Where do Southern Ocean airborne bacteria likely originate? Here, we used source-tracking to determine the potential ecosystem of origin of the ASVs identified in the Southern Ocean air and precipi-tation samples. Of the 1013 Southern Ocean ASVs identified, 584 were identified in the global database produced and therefore, had a potential origin [Fig. 7A]. These contributed to 41 % of the total relative abun-dance across the whole database, suggesting these were rather dominant taxa. Interestingly, we could not explain more than 30 % of the origin of the different Southern Ocean sample types [Fig. 7B], further high-lighting the unique ASVs identified in each group of samples. More taxa from other airborne sources were identified in the precipitation samples while more taxa of terrestrial origin, especially Antarctic soils, were identified in the sub- and peri-Antarctic islands’ air [Fig. 7C]. This result is an indication of the stronger influence of local inputs in these samples, suggesting that islands have a strong influence on the biodiversity of the air above them. Across the study, we found low numbers of ASVs of marine origin [Fig. 7C-F], despite most of the sampling being conducted above the ocean. The overall low input of ocean-associated microor-ganisms into the air globally (Archer et al., 2021 Preprint) may explain the limited influence of local ecosystems as sources of airborne micro-organisms over the oceans, as shown in this study and over the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (Mayol et al., 2017, Lang-Yona et al., 2022). In the literature, the consensus about the origins of aerobiological diversity is a combination of both aerosolization of local material and long-distance transport, and differential source regions and transport have been shown to influence microbial composition of the atmosphere (DeLeon-Rodriguez et al., 2013, Šantl-Temkiv et al., 2018). In oceanic air masses, microorganisms appear to originate primarily from long- distance transport of terrestrial microorganisms, although large un-certainties remain on the origins of ASVs.

Environment International 169 (2022) 1074929investigation of microbial communities in all ecosystems, as was started with the Earth Microbiome Project (Thompson et al., 2017), and the creation of an open-source database could shed light on the origin and dispersal patterns of microorganisms in the air. 2.7. Is the Antarctic Convergence Zone limiting bacterial dispersal to the Antarctic continent? Finally, we tested the hypothesis that the Antarctic Convergence Zone might act as a dispersal barrier (Pearce et al., 2009, Archer et al., 2019, King-Miaow et al., 2019, Uetake et al., 2020). To this end, and to consider the dynamic movements of air masses rather than consider the convergence as a static barrier, we identified the origin of the air mass using 5-day back track trajectories and compared the median latitude of the air mass to the latitude of the Antarctic Convergence at the relevant longitude. We compared global air samples (always considered north) and Southern Ocean air samples north of the Antarctic Convergence to the Southern Ocean air samples collected south of the convergence zone [Fig. 8]. We found differences in evenness and community composition, mainly driven by the global air communities [Fig. 8B] as these differ-ences were not apparent when comparing only Southern Ocean air sample north and south of the convergence zone. The majority of ASVs Fig. 7. A. Euler diagram showing the number of ASVs (# ASVs) with an origin identified from the global database and the relative abundance (Rel. Ab.). B.

Malard et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Environment International 169 (2022) 10749210were unique to samples either north or south of the convergence zone, with 308 ASVs (9 % of the total ASVs) shared between both [Fig. 8C]. Hence, the Antarctic Convergence Zone does not appear to be acting as a strict dispersal barrier but rather, the Southern Ocean may itself act as a selective dispersal filter. The size of the Southern Ocean and remoteness of the continent might, in themselves, be major filters of microorganisms unable to survive in the air longer than the minimum time required to attain suitable ecosystems. Therefore, the Southern Ocean itself may be limiting the dispersal of global airborne microorganisms to the Antarctic continent. 3. Summary We investigated patterns of bacterial biodiversity in the air above the Southern Ocean and provided evidence of low biomass, high diversity, heterogeneous, and unique communities from both local and global origin. We found that air communities over the Southern Ocean and its islands were significantly different from other ecosystems. However, these differences were not due to the Antarctic Convergence Zone acting as a dispersal barrier, but rather the air above the Southern Ocean acting as a selective dispersal filter. We identified 139 ASVs that were previously identified in air samples elsewhere, suggesting that these taxa may be pre-adapted to life in the atmosphere, efficient dispersers and therefore, may form part of a potential aerobiome. Significant differences in microbial air diversity following meteoro-logical patterns (air pressure, maximum potential temperature and the presence or absence of cyclones) and differences in communities from precipitation events suggests that bacterial biodiversity may be sensitive to changes in weather patterns that may result from climate change. These observations have important implications as climate change is known to increase precipitation in the Arctic (Pörtner et al., 2019). If they also increase in the Antarctic, it will lead to increased rates of microbial input and potentially higher diversity and increased risks of biological invasions. In addition, as the region warms, there will be more ice-free areas and free niches to colonise, potentially disrupting ecosystem function. Therefore, changing weather patterns through climate change may increase the frequency or the ability of microor-ganisms to reach Antarctica, illustrating the key role of the atmosphere the biogeography of microorganisms in Antarctica.

Environment International 169 (2022) 107492114. Materials and methods 4.1. ACE expedition and environmental data Antarctic air samples were collected aboard the R/V Akademik Tryoshnikov over an 85-day period between December 22nd, 2016, and March 16th, 2017, whilst the ship circumnavigated the Antarctic continent. The circumnavigation began and ended at Cape Town, South Africa with stops at Hobart, Australia and Punta Arenas, Chile during the voyage [Fig. 1A] (Landwehr et al., 2021). Location via GPS co-ordinates and weather data were collected continuously throughout the voyage via a Vaisala weather station aboard the ship, and included latitude, longitude, average wind direction, average wind speed, minimum wind speed, maximum wind speed, cloud level, sky coverage, relative hu-midity, temperature, dew point, pressure, solar radiance and UV radiation. We used back trajectories (Thurnherr et al., 2020a,b) calculated with the Lagrangian analysis tool LAGRANTO (Sprenger and Wernli, 2015) based on wind fields from the operational analysis data of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) to derive the maximum potential temperature and median latitude within the five days prior to the air mass’ arrival at the sampling location (see details in Schmale et al. (2019). We released 20 trajectories from within the boundary layer around the ship position each hour and averaged those for the duration of the sample collection. To classify whether a sample experienced air masses coming primarily from north or south of the polar front, we compared the median latitude per sample to the latitude of the Antarctic Convergence at the relevant longitude. The presence or absence of cyclones and the location of the sampling in the warm or cold sector of a cyclone were derived from published data sets (Thurnherr et al., 2020a,b, Thurnherr and Wernli, 2020) and as described in Thurnherr et al. (2021). 4.2. Air and precipitation sample collection Southern Ocean air samples were collected with sampling units set around the vessel to reduce the influence of sea spray and potential human bacterial sources [Fig. 1B]. Air samples from terrestrial locations were collected at the sub- and peri-Antarctic islands of Kerguelen, Bal-leny, Crozet, Bouvet and South Georgia and occasionally over the Ant-arctic continent. For terrestrial sites, sampling units were positioned at a height of 1.5 m to reduce the impact of local turbulence. Dry samples were collected via a membrane filtration apparatus set up, whereby a Welch WOB-L vacuum pump at a flow rate of 20L min− 1 (Welch, Mt. Prospect, IL, USA) was connected by tubing to a Sartorius filtration unit (Göttingen, Germany) containing a 47 mm × 0.2 μm pore size cellulose nitrate membrane filter (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Chicago, IL, USA). Samples were collected opportunistically for between one and 36 h. Dry samples were supplemented with a surface air system (SAS) sampler as backup. Wet samples were collected via a Bertin Co-riolis μ (Bertin Technologies, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France), where the collection cones were filled with sterile DNase and RNase free H2O (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the sampler run at a flow rate of 300 L m− 1 for a duration of 50 min. Wet samples were supplemented with an SKC sampler as backup. Precipitation samples were collected using a sterile funnel and filtered onto nitrocellulose 0.22 µm filters (Merck Millipore, Germany) using a sterile filtration unit (Sartorius, Groningen, Germany). All samples were stored at − 80 ◦C for the duration of the expedition. 4.3. DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing In total, 100 air samples and 7 precipitation samples were used in this study. Samples collected on filter substrates were first dissected into quarters using an ethanol and flame sterilised scalpel and a sterile petri dish in a Class II Microbiological safety cabinet. The dissected quarter filter was then placed directly into a labelled bead tube for extraction. Water-based (Coriolis) samples stored either in collection cones or fal-con tubes were transferred to sterile 15 mL falcon tubes and centrifuged for a duration of 20 min at 5000 g. Following centrifugation, the su-pernatant was removed leaving 1 mL, within which the formed pellet was re-suspended. This 1 mL was then loaded directly into a labelled bead tube for extraction. Where samples contained more than 15 mL liquid, they were combined after centrifugation, and the previous steps were repeated. DNA was extracted from each sample using the Qiagen PowerSoil kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions and DNA extracts were stored at − 20 ◦C. 16S rRNA gene libraries were constructed using the universal primers 515F and 806R (Caporaso et al., 2011) to amplify the V4 region. Amplicons were generated using a high- fidelity Accuprime DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), purified using the AMPure magnetic bead capture kit (Agencourt, Beckman Coulter, MA, USA), and quantified using a QuantIT PicoGreen fluorometric kit (Invitrogen). The purified amplicons were then pooled in equimolar concentrations using a SequalPrep plate normalization kit (Invitrogen), and the final concentration of the library was determined using a SYBR green quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay. Libraries were mixed with Illumina-generated PhiX control libraries and our own genomic libraries and denatured using fresh NaOH. The resulting amplicons were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq V2 (500 cycles). 4.4. Quantitative-PCR DNA extraction of membrane filters was performed in a class II microbiological cabinet. Filters were first cut in half (using a heat and UV sterilised scalpel) and sliced into thin ribbons to avoid clustering. DNA extraction was performed using the DNAeasy Powersoil Pro kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) Amplification of the 16S rRNA gene was carried out using the primer pair 27fmod (AGRGTTTGATCMTGGCT-CAG) and 519Rmodbio (GWATTACCGCGGCKGCTG), (Kozich et al., 2013) using a Step One Plus Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Massachusetts, United States). Each 20 µl qPCR reaction contained: 10 µl of 2X SYBR green master mix, 2 µl ROX reference dye, 0.2 µM forward primer, 0.2 µM reverse primer, 5.6 µl DNA and PCR grade water to 20 µl. The amplification method was as follows: initial 95 ◦C for 5 mins, then 40 cycles of (94 ◦C for 15 s and 53 ◦C for 30 s), followed by a melt curve. To facilitate absolute quantification of the 16S rRNA gene, DNA extracts from E. coli K12 cells were PCR amplified and run on an agarose gel, with product bands cut out and weighed for DNA extraction, using the Monarch Gel Extraction kit (New England Biolabs, Massachusetts, United States). DNA concentration (ng µl− 1) and purity (A260/280 nm) were determined via the use of a nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, United States). Gene copy number was determined using the following equation: (Amount of DNA (ng) × 6.022 × 1023)/(Gene Length (bp) × 1 × 109 × 660), where 6.022 × 1023 represents Avogadro’s Constant, 1 × 109 a conversion factor, and 660 is the average mass of 1 base pair (bp). A 1 in 10 serial dilution was then performed to generate 16S rRNA standards containing known gene copy numbers ranging from 1 × 107 to 1 × 101, which were run alongside air sample DNA and plotted to generate a standard curve, facilitating the quantification of 16S rRNA gene copies in each sample. 4.5. Bioinformatic processing The resulting amplicons were processed using the DADA2 pipeline (Callahan et al., 2016). Forward and reverse read pairs were trimmed and filtered, with forward reads truncated at 230 bp and reverse reads at 200 bp, no ambiguous bases were allowed, and each read required to have < 2 expected errors based on their quality scores. Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were independently inferred from the forward and reverse reads of each sample using the run-specific error rates. Reads were dereplicated, pairs were merged, and chimeras were L.A. Malard et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Environment International 169 (2022) 10749212removed from each sample. Taxonomic assignment was performed against the SILVA v138 database (Quast et al., 2012, Yilmaz et al., 2014) using the implementation of the RDP (ribosomal database project) naive Bayesian classifier (Wang et al., 2007). The decontam package (Davis et al., 2018) was used to identify potential contaminants using the prevalence function. The ASV table was also manually curated to discard ASVs present in the kit and MiSeq controls in higher abundance than in other samples, leaving 107 samples (±19,032 reads/sample) with 1013 assigned ASVs. 4.6. Global database We produced a global 16S rRNA gene database of marine, soil and air samples using data extracted from the NCBI database and based on studies using the primer set 515F-806R sequenced on Miseq (Fig. S1, Table S3, ASV and taxonomy tables are available on FigShare). Each dataset from individual studies was analysed separately using the DADA2 pipeline to independently calculate the error rate and infer ASVs. Three types of datasets were encountered but all were processed with the same criteria as the ACE samples, unless specified. Datasets with paired end reads (forward and reverse) or datasets with forward reads only but with the same amplicon length as paired-end reads were treated with the same criteria as the ACE samples. A few of the older datasets had forward reads only with smaller amplicons and were truncated to 100 bp before proceeding with the DADA2 pipeline. The unique ASV tables and the final ACE table were merged using the mergeSequenceTables function in DADA2 and identical ASVs were merged using the collapseNoMismatch function in DADA2 with a min-imum overlap of 90 bp, to ensure merging of ASVs with different amplicon lengths. Only ASVs present in at least two samples were conserved. Taxonomic assignment was performed against the SILVA v138 database (Quast et al., 2012, Yilmaz et al., 2014) using the implementation of the RDP naive Bayesian classifier (Wang et al., 2007). 4.7. Statistical analyses All statistical analyses were performed in the R environment using primarily a combination of phyloseq (McMurdie and Holmes, 2013) and vegan (Dixon, 2003), and visualised using ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016). For the global comparison, alpha diversity of all samples was computed in phyloseq with the plot_richness function, and ANOVA with Tukey’s honest significant difference (HSD) tests were used to compare differences between sample types. Linear models with second order polynomials were used to evaluate latitudinal associations with alpha diversity. For beta diversity, sample counts were transformed to pro-portions, the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix was computed and visualised using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). A PER-MANOVA with the adonis function was used compare beta diversity between sample types. Focusing on the Southern Ocean air (ACE expedition) samples, we compared marine air, terrestrial air and precipitation samples. Alpha diversity was computed with the plot_richness function and was compared between sample types using ANOVA with Tukey’s honest significant difference (HSD) tests. Linear regressions were computed to evaluate relationships between environmental variables and alpha di-versity. We also used random forest models to identify the most important variables associated with the alpha diversity of air commu-nities. The random forest (RF) models were computed using the rfPer-mute function with 5000 permutations and 5000 trees in the rfPermute package (Archer and Archer, 2020). For beta diversity, sample counts were transformed to proportions, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix was computed and visualised using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). A PERMANOVA with the adonis function was used to compare beta diversity between sample types and to identify associations with environmental variables. The ps_euler function from the MicEco (Russel, 2020) package was used to identify shared ASVs between groups of interest and produce Venn diagrams. Finally, we used the FEAST package (Shenhav et al., 2019) for the source tracking analysis. To identify the potential origin of Antarctic air ASVs, we used the global database as sources of ASVs and the ACE samples as sink. Differences between source origin and Southern Ocean sample types were tested with ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD tests. Finally, the ps_euler function was used to identify the potential aerobiome shared between the Southern Ocean and global air samples. CRediT authorship contribution statement Lucie A.

Successful Antarctic invasions to date have been recorded exclusively from terrestrial habitats. While non-native marine species such as crabs, mussels and tunicates have already been reported from Antarctic coasts, none have as yet established there. Among the potential marine invaders of Antarctic shallow waters is Halicarcinus planatus (Fabricius, 1775), a crab with a circum-Subantarctic distribution and substantial larval dispersal capacity. An ovigerous female of this species was found in shallow waters of Deception Island, South Shetland Islands in 2010. A combination of physiological experiments and ecological modelling was used to assess the potential niche of H. planatus and estimate its future southward boundaries under climate change scenarios. We show that H. planatus has a minimum thermal limit of 1°C, and that its current distribution (assessed by sampling and niche modelling) is physiologically restricted to the Subantarctic region. While this species is presently unable to survive in Antarctica, future warming under both ‘strong mitigation’ and ‘no mitigation’ greenhouse gas emission scenarios will favour its niche expansion to the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) by 2100. Future human activity also has potential to increase the probability of anthropogenic translocation of this species into Antarctic ecosystems",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/article, Journal articles","climate change, establishment, niche modelling, non-native species, reptant crab, Southern Ocean, survival, thermotolerance, [SDE.BE]Environmental Sciences/Biodiversity and Ecology, [SDV.BID]Life Sciences [q-bio]/Biodiversity",,Wiley

Antarctic flora mainly contains cryptogams and are dominated by lichens, followed by mosses and algae. Among three bio-geographic zones of Antarctica, Sub-Antarctic zone is the most diverse and followed by Maritime and Continental zone. The Antarctic plant growth is largely limited to the coastal areas of Sub- and Maritime Antarctic regions. Two vascular plants; Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis are restricted along with other cryptogams at Antarctic Peninsula region. The average increase in temperature is the most prominent change in Antarctic Peninsula. Due to favorable conditions, cryptogams (lichens and mosses) are widely distributed in several localities of Antarctica. The algal growth is restricted to the semi permanent to permanent snow or melt ice and in floating water bodies of Antarctica. About 700 non-marine algal taxa were recorded from the different region of the Antarctica. Beside this, 200 additional taxa have been recorded from the continental Antarctica. The changes in temperature, pattern of cyclonic activity, availability of nutrients, water, high UV-B radiation along with other stresses posses obstacles for survival and distribution of Antarctic flora",,Journal Article,"Antarctica, Biodiversity, Climate change, Lichens Mosses",,'Elsevier BV'
Antarctic climate-diversity-invasion hypothesis,484274210,Impacts of climate change on marine species invasions in northern hemisphere high-latitude ecosystems,,"Mahanes, Samuel A., Sorte, Cascade J. B.",2019,"High-latitude marine ecosystems have experienced fewer species invasions than temperate marine ecosystems, a discrepancy that may be attributed to barriers such as low propagule pressure, extreme and seasonal abiotic conditions, and biotic resistance of relatively intact communities. Each of these barriers is being affected by climate change and increasing human activity in high-latitude (&gt;55º N) areas. We reviewed the evidence for each of these barriers limiting species invasion in high-latitude areas in the northern hemisphere. Based on records from government documents of high‐latitude countries, non-native species appear to be increasing in number (in Denmark and the United States) although there remains a paucity of data on invasive species establishment for high-latitude regions. Future study is needed to identify the drivers and impacts of invasions at high latitudes so that managers looking to prevent invasions can focus their efforts on bolstering barriers to invasion in these unique ecosystems",,article,"climate change, species invasions, marine ecosystems, dispersal barriers, propagule pressure, extreme climates, seasonality, biotic resistance, high-latitude, northern hemisphere",,"eScholarship, University of California"
Antarctic climate-diversity-invasion hypothesis,226940965,The Antarctic Peninsula under a 1.5°C global warming scenario,10.17863/CAM.41810,"Siegert, M, Atkinson, A, Banwell, Alison, Brandon, M, Convey, P, Davies, B, Downie, R, Edwards, T, Hubbard, B, Marshall, G, Rogelj, J, Rumble, J, Stroeve, J, Vaughan, D",2019,"Warming of the Antarctic Peninsula in the latter half of the twentieth century was greater than any other terrestrial environment in the Southern Hemisphere, and clear cryospheric and biological consequences have been observed. Under a global 1.5◦C scenario, warming in the Antarctic Peninsula is likely to increase the number of days above 0◦C, with up to 130 of such days each year in the northern Peninsula. Ocean turbulence will increase, making the circumpolar deep water (CDW) both warmer and shallower, delivering heat to the sea surface and to coastal margins. Thinning and recession of marine margins of glaciers and ice caps is expected to accelerate to terrestrial limits, increasing iceberg production, after which glacier retreat may slow on land. Ice shelves will experience continued increase in meltwater production and consequent structural change, but not imminent regional collapses. Marine biota can respond in multiple ways to climatic changes, with effects complicated by past resource extraction activities. Southward distribution shifts have been observed in multiple taxa during the last century and these are likely to continue. Exposed (ice free) terrestrial areas will expand, providing new habitats for native and non-native organisms, but with a potential loss of genetic diversity. While native terrestrial biota are likely to benefit from modest warming, the greatest threat to native biodiversity is from non-native terrestrial species",,Article,,,Frontiers in Environmental Science

In the first chapter, I identify the fundamental and realized niches of the invasive red alga Capreolia implexa in Chile, and use these to identify its suitable habitat range and project changes in suitability under global warming. I conclude that C. implexa’s suitable range in South America is much larger than currently occupied, which might imply a huge potential for further spread. Under global warming, the suitable range will dramatically be reduced. In the second chapter, I assess the invasive potential of non-polar seaweeds to invade Antarctica, and conclude that such species might pose an invasion risk. This challenges the climate matching hypothesis which assumes that rather polar species pose a risk. As such, the risk of invasion for Antarctica is probably much larger than previously assumed. In the third chapter, I compare fundamental and realized niches of 126 seaweed species and assess how well distributions can be predicted based on thermal tolerance limits. I report that especially cold-tolerances are poor predictors of distributional patterns, while warm-tolerances are better predictors. I conclude that many seaweed species have cold-tolerances which are not discernable from their distributions. Further, approximately 60% of global seaweed species will face major challenges under global warming, as their distributional limits closely match their warm-tolerance limits, or lie even beyond.  In conclusion, I point out challenges in thermal niche identification of seaweeds and illustrate and discuss consequences for forecasting of bioinvasions and climate change effects.

We carried out an extensive sampling campaign along Victoria Land coastal line, collecting 180+ samples of lichens, mosses and freshwater sediments over a c. 600 km North–South transect. These samples revealed an unexpectedly high diversity: 14 species, four of which new for science.  Our results have underlined the level of undiscovered biodiversity in Antarctica. Some species had very localized distribution and occurred in specific substrates (e.g. moss or lichen). Other species were more scattered, and one (the endemic Acutuncus antarcticus) was present in almost all sampling areas and substrate types. This situation indicates that, as in temperate areas, Antarctica has tardigrade species with low dispersal capabilities, and a few species with high dispersal capabilities. Surprisingly, the genetic variability of A. antarcticus (COI gene) was extremely low even between very distant populations.   Laboratory experiments on the adaptive strategy of A. antarcticus indicated a very short life cycle (c. 3-4 months), shorter than in species from temperate regions. Moreover, A. antarcticus exhibits thelytoky and has cryptobiotic capabilities.

Under the strongest forcing scenario, ice-free areas could expand by over 17,000 km2 by the end of the century, close to a 25% increase. Most of this expansion will occur in the Antarctic Peninsula, where a threefold increase in ice-free area could drastically change the availability and connectivity of biodiversity habitat.

Cannone,2020,"Organisms living in polar regions are subject to some of the most extreme environmental conditions on Earth. Antarctic vegetation is mainly composed of non-vascular cryptogams, with bryophytes and  mosses, in particular, being the dominant terrestrial flora with lichens and algae (e.g., Øvstedal and Smith, 2001; Ochyra et al., 2008). Survival in Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems is based on the capability  to withstand cold temperatures, low and irregular water availability, scarce nutrients, unstable substrata, prolonged snow cover, low radiation receipt, wide seasonal variations in photoperiod and strong  winds (e.g., Kennedy, 1993, 1995). In Antarctica growth conditions are extreme and plants exist at the physiological limits of survival, with abiotic factors considered to be responsible for the restrictions  imposed upon the distributions of plant populations (Longton, 1988; Davey, 1997). In this harsh context, even slight changes to growth conditions are likely to have a large impact, rendering Antarctic  terrestrial communities sensitive to climate change (Robinson et al., 2003). As a consequence of these severe conditions, Antarctic flora is almost entirely cryptogamic. Only two vascular species,  Deschampsia antarctica Desv. and Colobanthus quitensis (Kunth) Bartl., occur, both of which are restricted to the Antarctic Peninsula.  Biodiversity patterns of the extant Antarctic biota are the result of a complex and long biogeographical and climatic history. Knowledge of these patterns, with special reference to past, present and future geoecological responses of these ecosystems, allows for facing and preventing, when possible, threats to the continent’s biodiversity deriving from climate change, biological invasions and anthropogenic impacts",,info:eu-repo/semantics/bookPart,"Biodiversity, biogeography, geoecological responses, climate change, Antarctica",,place:London

Much of this diversity is endemic not only to Antarctica as a whole, but to specific regions within it. Further complexity is added by inclusion of the biodiversity found on the islands located in the Southern Ocean north of the Treaty area. Within Antarctica, scientific, logistic and tourism activities may inadvertently move organisms over potentially long distances, far beyond natural dispersal ranges. Such translocation can disrupt natural species distribution patterns and biogeography through: (1) movement of spatially restricted indigenous species to other areas of Antarctica; (2) movement of distinct populations of more generally distributed species from one area of Antarctica to another, leading to genetic homogenisation and loss of assumed local patterns of adaptation; and (3) further dispersal of introduced non-native species from one area of Antarctica to another. Species can be moved between regions in association with people and cargo, by ship, aircraft and overland travel. Movement of cargo and personnel by ship between stations located in different biogeographic regions is likely to present one of the greatest risks, particularly as coastal stations may experience similar climatic conditions, making establishment more likely. Recognising that reducing the risk of inter-regional transfer of species is a priority issue for the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, we make practical recommendations aimed at reducing this risk, including the implementation of appropriate biosecurity procedures.This study also contributes to the ALIENANT project (CTM2013-47381-P) granted by Spanish MINECO to M.Á.

We propose that recent adaptation within the native range, in particular adaptations to human-altered habitat, could also contribute to the evolution of invasive populations. Populations adapted to human-altered habitats in the native range are likely to increase in abundance within areas frequented by humans and associated with human transport mechanisms, thus enhancing the likelihood of transport to a novel range. Given that habitats are altered by humans in similar ways worldwide, as evidenced by global environmental homogenization, propagules from populations adapted to human-altered habitats in the native range should perform well within similarly human-altered habitats in the novel range.

Anthropogenically induced adaptation to invade hypothesis,12955015,Adaptations of phytophagous insects on invasive host plant species,,Norda L.J.,2011,"Since humans have started travelling and colonizing new areas they have brought animals and plants along with them, introducing them into new environments. Sometimes these introductions happened intentional; livestock, garden plants and crops for example, but sometimes they happened unintentional for example, rats and plant seeds. This human-influenced geographic shuffling of organisms is probably the most biologically dynamic of anthropogenic ‘global change’ phenomena (Carroll, 2007b). A lot of these introduced species do not survive or reproduce in their new habitats due to unsuitable conditions, or are outcompeted by native species and do not become established. Some species however, have managed to become established. This is especially the case in disturbed habitats (Davis et al., 2000; Rejmanek et al., 2004). Disturbed habitats lose constituent species and nonnative species can become established by accessing the resources left unused by these constituent species (Fargione & Tilman, 2005; Levine et al., 2004), or because the nonnative species are better adapted to disturbed habitats than the native species (Burke & Grime, 1996; Strauss et al., 2006b). Another factor determining whether a nonnative species becomes established is whether they can escape natural enemies in ways that give them a competitive advantage over native species (Colautti et al., 2004; Joshi & Vrieling, 2005; Stastny et al., 2005). Therefore whether a nonnative species becomes established depends on both the ecological circumstances of the habitat and the genetic variability of the introduced species (Carroll, 2007b). If established populations of a nonnative species grow and spread due to successful reproduction and recruitment of subsequent generations into the breeding population, that species may become prominent in the native biota or ‘invasive’ (Parker et al., 1999; Richardson et al., 2000). Invasive species may even become dominant to native populations (Crooks, 2002; Davis & Thompson, 2000).",,,,,

Here, we analyze a simulation demo-genetic model of bioinvasion accounting for partial asexuality rates. We simulate two levels of recurrent immigration from a source population at mutation–drift–selection equilibrium to a new empty environment with a different adaptive landscape (black-holesink). Adaptation relies on a quantitative trait coded explicitly by10 lociunder mutation, selection and genetic drift. Using this model, we conﬁrm previous results on the positive effects on invasiveness of migration, mutation and similarity of local phenotypic optima. We further show how the invasion dynamics of the introduced population is affected by the rate of asexuality. Purely asexual species have lower invasion success in terms of probability and time to invasion than species with other matingsystems. Among species with mixed mating systems, the greatest invasiveness is observed for species with high asexual rates. We suggest that this pattern is due to inﬂated genetic variance in the source population through the Hill-Robertson effect (i.e., clonal interference).

It emphasizes the evolutionary antecedents of invasions, i.e. the species’ evolutionary legacy and its role in shaping novel biotic interactions that arise due to invasions. We present a conceptual framework consisting of five hypothetical scenarios about the influence of so-called ‘eco-evolutionary experience’ in resident native and invading non-native species on invasion success, depending on the type of ecological interaction (predation, competition, mutualism, and commensalism). We show that several major ecological invasion hypotheses, including ‘enemy release’, ‘EICA’, ‘novel weapons’, ‘naïve prey’, ‘new associations’, ‘missed mutualisms’ and ‘Darwin’s naturalization hypothesis’ can be integrated into this framework by uncovering their shared implicit reference to the concept of eco-evolutionary experience.

Understanding the factors underlying establishment and spread of exotic species in order to predict invasion risks is a major goal in invasion biology. Many theoretical studies investigated the ecological and evolutionary components of these factors and their impact on the invasive process. Yet, hypothesis tests through experimental approaches are still scarce because of the practical and ethical difficulties associated with the introduction of exotic species in nature. Thus, most empirical results come from a posteriori analyses of fortuitous invasions, which allow correlative approaches at best and give no information about invasion failures. In this paper, we propose microcosms, i.e. reproducible controlled simplified environments, as an alternative to experimental introductions in natura. From a review of the literature, we discuss the distinctive features of microcosms to test theoretical predictions about invasion. Our analysis focuses on studies involving populations in transitory dynamics after a demographic bottleneck and/or subject to an adaptive challenge, two key characteristics of invasive processes. Despite their small number, these studies have been used successfully to explore the influences of various factors, mainly related to the introduction site characteristics (its abiotic conditions and their spatial and temporal heterogeneity), and to a lesser extent to the introduced individuals themselves (propagule pressure, genetic diversity and adaptations in the introduced population) or the invaded community. We argue that microcosms, as model systems, can be powerful tools to test theoretical hypotheses. They must however be used with care, as they do not account for the same complexity as natural systems.

However, conditions during transport – an early stage of the invasion – can be particularly harsh, thereby greatly reducing the size of a population available to establish in a new region. Some successful non‐indigenous species are more tolerant of environmental and anthropogenic stressors than related native species, possibly stemming from selection (ie survival of only pre‐adapted individuals for particular environmental conditions) during the invasion process. By reviewing current literature concerning population genetics and consequences of selection on population fitness, we propose that selection acting on transported populations can facilitate local adaptation, which may result in a greater likelihood of invasion than predicted by propagule pressure alone. Specifically, we suggest that detailed surveys should be conducted to determine interactions between molecular mechanisms and demographic factors, given that current management strategies may underestimate invasion risk",,"Article, PeerReviewed",,,'Wiley'

However, invasion frameworks generally do not consider reciprocal interactions between non-native species and people. Non-native species can shape human actions via beneficial or detrimental ecological and socioeconomic effects and people, in turn, shape invasions through their movements, behaviour and how they respond to the collection, transport, introduction and spread of non-natives. The feedbacks that stem from this 'coupled human and natural system' (CHANS) could therefore play a key role in mitigating (i.e. negative feedback loops) or exacerbating (i.e. positive feedback loops) ongoing and future invasions. We posit that the invasion process could be subdivided into three CHANS that span from the source region from which non-natives originate to the recipient region in which they establish and spread. We also provide specific examples of feedback loops that occur within each CHANS that have either reduced or facilitated new introductions and spread of established non-native species. In so doing, we add to exisiting invasion frameworks to generate new hypotheses about human-based drivers of biological invasions and further efforts to determine how ecological outcomes feed back into human actions",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/article, publication-article",coupled human and natural systems coupled social-ecological systems feedback loop invasive negative feedback non-native positive feedback,,Pensoft Publishers

Anthropogenically induced adaptation to invade hypothesis,45557469,How do native species respond to invaders? Mechanistic and trait-based perspectives,10.1007/s10530-015-0874-7,"Berthon, Katherine",2015,"Adaptive responses of native species are important in enabling their persistence in the face of unprecedented biotic exchange. In the present paper I discuss how native species respond to invasive species both from a mechanistic and trait-based perspective. An earlier review by Strauss et al. (Ecol Lett 9:357–374, 2006) discussed a conceptual model of native species evolution in which the likelihood of an evolutionary response to an invader is dependent upon the strength of the selective pressure imposed (degree of variation in fitness between genotypes) and the adaptive capacity of the native (extent of pre-adaptation or genetic diversity). I aim to update and build upon this framework in light of new information on the interaction of phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary processes in adaptive responses of native species. Phenotypic plasticity can be a precursor to or an inhibitor of evolutionary responses and, under conditions of strong selection, phenotypic plasticity may enable adaptation where natives have a low evolutionary capacity. Based on current evidence, it is likely that phenotypic plasticity is the first front in native species adaptation, after which genetic changes occur via a genetic accommodation mechanism. Lastly, I review the literature on behavioural, morphological, physiological and life history trait changes of responding native species in light of this framework. Knowledge of the genetic and physiological underpinnings of adaptive responses in native species is limited and would aid in distinguishing the contributions of phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary change in future studies.13 page(s",,journal article,"Evolution, Invasion, Native species, Phenotypic plasticity, Response",Biological Invasions,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC'

A comprehensive assessment of empirical and theoretical evidence identified how each of these processes is likely to be shaped by climate change for alien plants, animals and pathogens in terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments of Great Britain. The strongest contemporary evidence for the potential role of climate change in the establishment of new alien species is for terrestrial arthropods, as a result of their ectothermic physiology, often high dispersal rate and their strong association with trade as well as commensal relationships with human environments. By contrast, there is little empirical support for higher temperatures increasing the rate of alien plant establishment due to the stronger effects of residence time and propagule pressure. The magnitude of any direct climate effect on the number of new alien species will be small relative to human-assisted introductions driven by socioeconomic factors. Casual alien species (sleepers) whose population persistence is limited by climate are expected to exhibit greater rates of establishment under climate change assuming that propagule pressure remains at least at current levels. Surveillance and management targeting sleeper pests and diseases may be the most cost-effective option to reduce future impacts under climate change. Most established alien species will increase their distribution range in Great Britain over the next century. However, such range increases are very likely be the result of natural expansion of populations that have yet to reach equilibrium with their environment, rather than a direct consequence of climate change. To assess the potential realised range of alien species will require a spatially explicit approach that not only integrates bioclimatic suitability and population-level demographic rates but also simulation of landscape-level processes (e.g. dispersal, land-use change, host/habitat distribution, non-climatic edaphic constraints). In terms of invasive alien species that have known economic or biodiversity impacts, the taxa that are likely to be the most responsive are plant pathogens and insect pests of agricultural crops. However, the extent to which climate adaptation strategies lead to new crops, altered rotations, and different farming practices (e.g. irrigation, fertilization) will all shape the potential agricultural impacts of alien species. The greatest uncertainty in the effects of climate change on biological invasions exists with identifying the future character of new species introductions and predicting ecosystem impacts. Two complementary strategies may work under these conditions of high uncertainty: (i) prioritise ecosystems in terms of their perceived vulnerability to climate change and prevent ingress or expansion of alien species therein that may exacerbate problems; (ii) target those ecosystem already threatened by alien species and implement management to prevent the situation deteriorating under climate change",,Journal Article,"biosecurity, exotic, globalisation, non-native, pathways, species distribution models, weed, Animals, Ecosystem, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Introduced Species, United Kingdom, Animals, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Ecosystem, Introduced Species, United Kingdom",Biological Reviews,Wiley on behalf of the Cambridge Philosophical Society

They are commonly discussed in the context of the ecological perturbations or the human activities that permitted the invasion. There is also evidence, that there is an intrinsic component to biological invasions in that evolutionary changes of the invaders themselves can facilitate or limit invasions (Lee 2002; Urban et al. 2007; Van Bocxlaer et al. 2010). Hence, teasing apart whether environmental change or changes of the organism foster invasions is an interesting field of research. Ample evidence for plants and animals documents that ecological change and human activities trigger range expansions and invasions, but questions regarding evolutionary change of invaders remain less explored although there are several reasons to believe it matters. Firstly, rapid evolutionary change is possible in timeframes relevant for contemporary biological invasions (Hendry et al. 2007). Furthermore, population genetic modelling suggests that there are circumstances where the range expansion and colonization of empty spaces in the course of an invasion can induce evolutionary change in a way that is specific to invaders: the process of repeated founding out of marginal populations in the course of a range expansion can shift allele frequencies and has been referred to as allele surfing, which not only affects neutral genetic variance, but also fitness relevant traits (Klopfstein et al. 2006; Travis et al. 2007; Burton & Travis 2008). Importantly, this process poses a null model for evolutionary inference in invasive populations. It predicts conspicuous allele frequency changes in an expanding metapopulation unless migration homogenizes the gene pool. Despite this relevance, ideas about allele surfing rely heavily on modelling although some experimental evidence comes from studies that document the segregation of genetic variants in growing plaques of bacteria (Hallatschek et al. 2007). To date, little empirical data is available that would reveal the migration processes that affect the establishment of gene pools at invasion fronts in natural systems. This aspect sets the study of Bronnenhuber et al. (2011) apart. They quantify migration behind the expansion front of an invading fish and thus provide important baseline data for the interpretation of the emerging patterns of genetic differentiation",,info:eu-repo/semantics/article,,,'Wiley'

An important process is that during each step of the introduction,  a subset of individuals may be selected. My question in this essay is whether the introduction process would cause behavioral and/or genetic change through a series of selective processes. The initial introduction stages act as a bottleneck, reducing genetic diversity relative to the original population. Invasive Argentine ants show reduced intraspecific aggression, but it is unclear if this change is an adaptation. Invasive cane toads evolve to disperse at a faster rate.

Theory in ecology and evolution often relies on the analysis of invasion processes, and general approaches exist to understand the early stages of an invasion. However, predicting the long-term transformations of communities following an invasion remains a challenging endeavour. 2. We propose a general analytical method that uses both resident community and invader dynamical features to predict whether an invasion causes large long-term impacts on the invaded community. 3. This approach reveals a direction in which classic invasion analysis, based on initial invasion growth rate, can be extended. Indeed, we explain how the density dependence of invasion growth, if properly defined, synthetically encodes the long-term biotic transformations caused by an invasion, and therefore predicts its ultimate outcome. This approach further clarifies how the density dependence of the invasion growth rate is as much a property of the invading population as it is one of the invaded community. 4. Our theory applies to any stable community model, and directs us towards new questions that may enrich the toolset of invasion analysis, and suggests that indirect interactions and dynamical stability are key determinants of invasion outcomes.Funding Agencies|H2020 European Research Council [666971]; Agence Nationale de la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR)European Commission [ANR-10-LABX-41]; VetenskapsradetSwedish Research Council [VR-2017-05245]; Irish Research CouncilIrish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology [IRCLA/2017/186]</p",,"Article in journal, info:eu-repo/semantics/article, text","adaptive dynamics; alternative stable states; coexistence; ecological stability; extinctions; feedback loops; invasion fitness; press perturbation, Ecology, Ekologi",,'Wiley'

Evolutionary changes may occur followingintroduction into a remote new location, as an evolutionaryresponse to new biotic and/or abiotic pressures (Sakai et al. 2001;Cox 2004), hereafter called ‘post-introduction adaptation scenario’.Hence, evolutionary changes should occur independently at eacharea of introduction. For example, the invasive marine copepodEurytemora affinis has adapted to freshwater habitats independentlyseveral times, with the advent of ballast water shipping and dis-charge into freshwater lakes on several continents (Lee 1999). Twoalternative eco-evolutionary invasion scenarios have also recentlybeen proposed to account for the invasiveness of some populations.First, adaptation may occur at a primary site of invasion, with otherterritories subsequently invaded from this site, a scenario recentlycalled the ‘bridgehead scenario’ (Lombaert et al. 2010). Adaptivechanges may thus occur only once, at the bridgehead locality. Theadaptive changes occurring at this site may overcome biotic and/orabiotic barriers to invasion, thereby facilitating subsequent establish-ment following dispersal to other biogeographical areas with selec-tive pressures similar to those at the bridgehead. Alternatively, keyevolutionary changes for the invasion may occur within the nativerange, before dispersal into the introduced range (Bossdorf et al.2008; Hufbauer et al. 2012). This scenario has recently beendescribed as ‘two-step’ (Foucaud et al. 2009) or anthropogenicallyinduced adaptation to invade (AIAI) when this prior adaptationrelates to the alteration of habitats by humans (Hufbauer et al.2012). Hereafter, we used the term ‘prior-adaptation’, sometimesalso called ‘pre-adaptation’, to refer to this scenario (see Hufbaueret al. 2012 for arguments supporting the term prior-adaptation).Unravelling the eco-evolutionary scenarios leading to the emer-gence of invasive populations has important implications both forinvasion theory, to improve our understanding of the circumstancesfavouring adaptive changes during invasion, and for managementpolicies, as it may guide actions for preventing or controlling inva-sions. However, substantial amounts of information are required todistinguish between eco-evolutionary invasion scenarios and thisinformation has proved difficult to obtain (Hufbauer et al. 2012).The information required includes (1) phenotypic data for bothnative and introduced populations, to determine whether adaptationoccurred during invasion, (2) genetic data for documenting thegenetic relationship between native and invasive populations andretracing the invasion route and (3) environmental data (abioticand/or biotic) to assess the selection pressures acting in both nativeand introduced populations.

Genetic tools have also been used to decipher complex inva-sion histories (e.g. Lombaert et al. 2010; Ascunce et al. 2011).Species distribution models (SDM) have been used to identify eco-logical niche shifts associated with invasion (e.g. Broennimann et al.2007). Recently, Lachmuth et al. (2010) highlighted the benefit ofcombining climatic data with neutral genetic analyses to shed lighton the genetic and ecological mechanisms contributing to the inva-siveness of populations. However, to our knowledge, experimental,genetic and SDM approaches have never been applied simulta-neously to the same species for unambiguous determination of theeco-evolutionary scenario of an invasion.We conducted an integrative study combining experimental,genetic and SDM approaches, to determine which of the three eco-evolutionary invasion scenarios cited above was responsible for therecent invasion of a Mediterranean region (i.e. Israel; Vonshak et al.2010) by the tropical ant Wasmannia auropunctata. We first used SDManalyses to identify geographical regions in which native and/orinvasive populations of W. auropunctata were subject to cold-temper-ature selection pressures similar to those in Israel. We then con-ducted a worldwide genetic analysis based on mitochondrial andmicrosatellite markers, to determine the genetic origin of the Israelilineage, focusing on populations established in the candidate geo-graphical areas identified in our SDM analysis. Finally, we con-ducted laboratory experiments to compare the response to coldstress of workers from Israeli populations and workers from a largeset of populations from the native and introduced ranges, takinginto account the results obtained with the other two approaches(i.e. SDM and genetic analyses). This integrative approach allowedto test (1) whether the establishment of W. auropunctata populationsin Israel was accompanied by an adaptation of workers to local coldtemperature and (2) whether this adaptation occurred within theintroduced range in Israel (i.e. post-introduction adaptation sce-nario), or before transportation to Israel, either at a primary site ofinvasion (i.e. bridgehead scenario) or in particular habitats withinthe native range (i.e. prior-adaptation scenario).MATERIALS AND METHODSStudy speciesWasmannia auropunctata originates from the neotropic ecozone, fromnorthern Argentina to Mexico (Wetterer & Porter 2003), and dis-plays two types of populations within its native range. Ancestralnative populations are confined to tropical primary forests, occupy-ing naturally disturbed areas (e.g. floodplains), and are characterisedby low nest and worker densities (Wetterer & Porter 2003; Orivelet al. 2009). Some populations have repeatedly invaded human-modified habitats within the native range (e.g. road sides, planta-tions; Orivel et al. 2009). This change of habitat within the nativerange is associated with a major ecological shift, with high workerand nest densities (Orivel et al. 2009) and a genetic shift in thereproductive system, from a haplo–diploid sexual model to clonallyreproducing queens and males (Foucaud et al. 2007, 2009).Since the beginning of the 20th century, W. auropunctata hasinvaded many countries in tropical and subtropical zones (Wetterer& Porter 2003; Foucaud et al. 2010). In its introduced range, theinvasive populations settle in human-altered habitats and displayseveral traits similar to those of the clonal populations from thenative area (i.e. ecological dominance and clonality; Foucaud et al.2010). In 2005, established populations of W. auropunctata were iden-tified in Israel, in the Mediterranean zone, which is characterised byclimatic features, including colder winter temperatures, very differ-ent from those in the tropical core habitat (Vonshak et al. 2010).Despite these contrasted abiotic conditions, the Israeli populationsdisplay nesting and foraging behaviour similar to that observed intropical and subtropical areas (Vonshak et al. 2010). The ability offoraging workers to cope with cold winter temperatures suggeststhat the Israeli population may have undergone adaptation to coldtemperatures, allowing it to invade this new biogeographical area.Species distribution modelling analysesWe used the ‘domain’ algorithm (Carpenter et al. 1993) to modelthe distribution of W. auropunctata on the basis of 88 georeferencedoccurrences in Israel. The occurrences are widely distributed inIsrael (Fig. 1b) and hence are likely to represent most of the cli-matic range that W. auropunctata may potentially encounter in thisregion. Half these occurrences were used for model fitting, theother half being used for model evaluation. The climate data studiedincluded four variables describing the cold-temperature conditionstypical of the habitats occupied in Israel: the minimum temperatureof the coldest month, the mean temperature of the coldest quarter,the annual mean temperature and the annual temperature range(available from the WORLDCLIM database; Hijmans et al. 2005).Data were managed using GIS GRASS software (GRASS Develop-ment Team 2008), interfaced with R via the R packages spgrass6(Bivand 2011) and raster (Hijmans & van Etten 2010). Models werefitted and evaluated using the R package dismo (Hijmans et al.2010).We evaluated the performance of the models for the Israeliregion, by comparing model predictions with observations, by calcu-lating the area under the curve (AUC) of a receiver operating char-acteristics plot (Fielding & Bell 1997). As only data for occurrenceswere available, pseudoabsences were generated at random for thegeographical region over which the model was defined (Fig. 1b).The domain algorithm yielded a model that was ultimately used toidentify geographical regions worldwide with similar climatic condi-tions and in which W. auropunctata populations had previously beenreported.This above simple method was used because it shows a low riskof overfitting the data and hence a robust transferability to otherremote geographical regions (Carpenter et al. 1993). We neverthelessconducted a complementary analysis based on the multivariate envi-ronmental similarity surface (MESS) approach (Elith et al. 2010; seeAppendix S1 in supporting information). Because species distribu-tion models assume that records represent a species at equilibriumwith its environment, which is rarely verified in invasive species, wealso conducted further MESS analyses simulating pseudo-equilib-rium of W. auropunctata distribution with climate, in the geographicalregion of Israel (Appendix S2).Genetic analysesUsing mitochondrial and microsatellite data, we conducted phylo-geographical genetic analyses to investigate the branching positionof Israeli individuals within a large set of samples from tropical/© 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRSLetter Cold adaptation of an invasive ant 1267subtropical native and invasive populations (Figure SS1). DNA wasextracted and purified from all individuals analysed, by a standardCTAB (hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide)-based protocol.Mitochondrial dataWe amplified a 700–710 bp fragment of the mitochondrial COI(cytochrome oxidase I) gene from 136 individuals (83 workers and 53queens), with two sets of primers (Appendix S3). In total, 123 ofthese individuals originated from 31 native and 20 introduced popu-lations in the tropical/subtropical zone; the other 13 individuals(five queens and eight workers) originated from seven nests in Israel(Figure SS1). Two sequences from the closely related speciesWasmannia rochai were used as an outgroup.Our phylogeographical analyses were performed on unique haplo-types (35 in total). Sequences were partitioned into codon positions(cp) and models of evolution were independently selected for fivesets of partitions (first cp; second cp; third cp; first/second cp;first/second/third cp). This was achieved by comparing Akaike’sinformation criteria corrected for samples of small size (i.e. AICc,Posada & Buckley 2004 and references therein) in JMODELTEST(Posada 2008). Relationships between W. auropunctata haplotypeswere then constructed by Bayesian inference, with MRBAYESv3.1.2 (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003). Three distinct partitioningstrategies (PS) were used (unpartitioned analysis, one partition percp, one partition for first/second cp + one partition for third cp).For each PS, two independent runs were carried out, for 20 milliongenerations each, with eight Markov chains. The best PS was thenidentified by comparing Bayes’ factors (Kass & Raftery 1995) andthe corresponding tree was constructed with a conservative burn-inof 25%. Node support was estimated from posterior probabilities(i.e. the proportion of post burn-in trees recovering a particularclade; Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003).More specifically, we evaluated the robustness of the affiliation ofthe Israeli haplotype to clade B (see results). We constrained theposition of the Israeli haplotype by forcing it into the other clade(i.e. clade A), using the settings for the best PS. We then used Ba-yes’ factors to determine whether there was significantly less statisti-cal support for the constrained analysis than for the unconstrainedanalysis.Microsatellite dataIn W. auropunctata clonal populations, the nuclear genomes ofqueens and males behave as two independent lineages (Fournieret al. 2005a; Foucaud et al. 2007). We therefore carried out microsat-(a)(b) (c)(d) (e)Figure 1 (a) Geographical regions where the DOMAIN model was fitted; (b) in the region of Israel (black circles are W. auropunctata distribution records); (c) within thenative range and surrounding invaded areas and (d–e) in regions outside the native range in which invasive W. auropunctata populations have been reported (red zones).The colour legend indicated in (c) corresponds to a measure of climatic similarity relative to the niche envelop of W. auropunctata defined in Israel based on the Gowermetric. The native range of W. auropunctata, is surrounded by a green strip in (c). Results of model fitting for the tropical islands of Hawaii and Tahiti, where W.auropunctata is established, are not shown because these islands displayed no climatic similarities to Israel.© 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS1268 Olivier Rey et al. Letterellite analyses on the two sexes separately. We added to the data setpublished by Foucaud et al. (2010) additional data including thegenotypes of 12 males and 33 queens from seven populations sam-pled from Argentina. A global data set of 453 male and 1093 queengenotypes was analysed in this study. For sites from which no maleswere sampled, we analysed the spermatheca content of the queens,when possible (see Fournier et al. 2005a). All individuals were geno-typed at 12 microsatellite loci (Fournier et al. 2005b). Dendrogramswere constructed from individual genotypes with the neighbour-joining algorithm (Saitou & Nei 1987) and a variant of Chakrabortyand Jin’s allele shared distance (Chakraborty & Jin 1993; seeFournier et al. 2005a).Laboratory experimentsSampled populationsWe sampled a total of 15 W. auropunctata populations (Table 1). Afirst set of twelve populations was used to check whether coldadaptation occurred in Israeli populations during invasion: (1) sixpopulations from the native tropical area corresponding to the corehabitat, with three populations from natural habitats (i.e. primaryforest) and three populations from human-modified habitats (i.e.plantation or roadside) and (2) six populations from the invasiverange, two populations from the tropical zone and four populationsfrom the Mediterranean zone (Israel). A second set of three popula-tions was used to determine more specifically the site of adaptation,based on the results of SDM and genetic analyses (see Results): (1)two populations from Zarate (Buenos Aires province, Argentina), azone located at the southern margin of the native range and (2) onepopulation from Florida, corresponding to a subtropical zone of theintroduced range. All but the two Argentinean populations werereared and studied at the CBGP laboratory (Montpellier, France).The two populations from Argentina were reared and studied at theSABCL laboratory (Buenos Aires, Argentina) due to strong legalrestrictions on the importation of live W. auropunctata from Argen-tina to Europe. In both laboratories, ants were reared in a walk-inclimatic chamber maintained at constant temperature and humidity(25 °C; 70% RH; L:D 12 : 12) for at least 2 months, to ensure thatall the workers tested in the experiments had been produced in thelaboratory. This time lag minimised both maternal environmentaleffects and the impact of the acclimation factor in the interpretationof our results. During this period, ants were fed ad libitum with ahoney–yeast–water solution and Ephestia eggs.Cold toleranceWe measured survival and time taken by workers to recover fromcold stress (a reversible state of narcosis induced by cold). Survivalis a direct measure of fitness and time taken to recover from chillcoma is an appropriate phenotypic surrogate for the assessment ofcold adaptation in insects (Gibert et al. 2001; Hoffmann et al. 2003).All populations were tested according to the same protocol. Weplaced 50 workers from each population in five sealed and meshedboxes (10 workers per box) and fed them with 0.5 mL of honey–water for 1 h. Workers were then placed in a climatic chamber at2 °C for 16 h. This temperature is close to the lowest absolute min-imum air temperature recorded in the winter months between 1981and 2000 in Tel Aviv (Israel, January: 2.5 °C and February: 2.6 °C,Israeli Meteorological Service). At the end of the cold-stress period,the boxes were placed in a walk-in climatic chamber with standardclimatic conditions (i.e. 25 °C, 70% RH). The proportion of work-ers recovering from cold stress in each box was determined at 11time points: just after the cold shock, after 27, 40 and 60 min, andthen every 30 min until 5 h. This experiment was then repeated forall but the two Argentinean populations tested, giving a total of1400 tested workers (50 workers 9 13 populations 9 2 runs at theCBGP and 50 workers 9 2 populations at the SABCL).We investigated the response of workers to cold stress as a func-tion of six biogeographical origins defined on the basis of the fol-lowing three criteria: native vs. introduced, climatic range (tropical,subtropical or Mediterranean), and natural vs. human-modified habi-tats. As not all population combinations exist in the field (e.g. intro-duced populations in natural habitats) we ended up with sixbiogeographical origins: tropical native area in natural habitat, tropi-cal native area in human-modified habitat, tropical-introduced zone,subtropical introduced zone (i.e. Florida), subtropical native mar-ginal zone (i.e. Argentina) and Mediterranean-introduced area (i.e.Israel). For each of these six origins, we investigated the relation-ship between the proportion of workers that had recovered and thetime since cold stress, by fitting a non-linear mixed model (nlme)according to a reparameterised Gompertz relationship implementedusing R statistical software (R Development Core Team 2010), witha mean function defined as follows:fðxÞ ¼ plateau  expðexpðc  ðd  xÞÞÞThis model was found to better fit the pattern of worker recoveryfollowing cold stress over the period of observation than a linearmodel for the six biogeographical origins (Appendix S4). Twoparameters, the ‘plateau’ and the parameter ‘d’, corresponding to themaximum proportion of surviving workers and the abscissa at theinflexion point (i.e. a good proxy for the speed with which workersrecovered), respectively, were estimated for each of the six biogeo-graphical origins and compared. Parameter estimates with non-over-lapping confidence intervals were considered to be significantlydifferent. Note that the estimate of ‘time for workers to recover’obtained for the Argentinean populations should be interpretedTable 1 Wasmannia auropunctata populations sampled for laboratory experimentsassessing cold tolerance.

Our predictive analyses across the globaldistribution range of W. auropunctata highlighted a small number ofregions with climatic conditions similar, in terms of coldness, tothose occupied by W. auropunctata in Israel. We identified thenorth-eastern region of Argentina as the largest geographicalregion with similarities to the climatic envelope defined in Israelwithin the native range and the surrounding regions of this species(Fig. 1c). Outside its native range, some regions of North Amer-ica, Australia and Africa also displayed locally similar cold temper-atures (Fig. 1c–e). However, Florida was the only such region inwhich populations of W. auropunctata were reported. This speciesindeed occurs in Africa and Australia, but not under local climateconditions, in term of coldness, similar to those found in Israel(Fig. 1d–e). Similar results were obtained using the MESSapproach (Appendix S1) as well as when considering pseudo-equi-librium of W. auropunctata distribution records with climate(Appendix S2).Genetic analysesOur tree based on the mitochondrial COI contains two main clades:clades A and B (Fig. 2; see also Mikheyev & Mueller 2007). All thepopulations established in Israel were characterised by a unique hap-lotype branching off within clade B. The alternative topology (i.e.Israeli haplotype constrained into clade A) was less supported thanthe best topology obtained (Bayes’ factor = 5.1). Clade B containsother populations located in the southern region of the native range(i.e. haplotypes from North Argentina, Paraguay and southern Bra-zil).The Israeli haplotype was rigorously identical to that found inclonal populations established in Zárate, Buenos Aires province(Argentina C5, Fig. 2 and see map in Appendix SF1) and differedfrom the haplotype of the clonal lineage established in the city ofBuenos Aires by only one nucleotide (Argentina C4, AppendixSF1). The Florida haplotype was assigned to clade A, indicating thatthe Florida and Israeli populations are genetically well differentiated.The microsatellite data obtained for queens and males confirmedthat Israeli populations were established from a single pair of queenand male genotypes reproducing clonally. These clonal genotypeswere strictly identical to those found by Vonshak et al. (2009) insamples collected in 2005. Both the queen and male genotypes fromIsrael were assigned to genetic clusters including only genotypes ofindividuals from Argentina (Fig. 3). For queens, the closest Argen-tinean genotypes were those of individuals from populations estab-lished near Buenos Aires and in the Ocloyas mountain region (C4,C5 and C3; Fig. 3; Figure SS1). The Israeli clonal male lineage hada multilocus haploid genotype remarkably similar to that of clonalmales from Argentinean populations established near Buenos Aires(C5 and C6; Fig. 3). Consistent with phylogeographical results basedon mtDNA analyses, the Israeli queen and male microsatellite geno-types were distantly related to those of populations from Florida(Fig. 3).Cold toleranceWorkers from populations established in Israel survived significantlybetter (plateau = 0.95) and recovered faster (d = 35.67) than workersfrom the tropical native area of both natural habitats (plateau = 0.15;d = 59.01) and human-modified habitats (plateau = 0.35; d = 52.86)and populations established in the tropical-introduced zone(plateau = 0.46; d = 74.95) (Fig. 4b). Workers from the subtropical-introduced zone, (Florida; plateau = 0.79; d = 62.83) and from thesubtropical native marginal zone (Argentina; plateau = 0.91;d = 7.24) also recovered better and faster than all tropical popula-tions. Workers from Israeli populations survived better and recov-ered faster than populations originating from Florida, but did notdo better than Argentinean populations.Additional analyses based on GLMMs revealed similar trends andled to the same main conclusions (Appendix S5).DISCUSSIONEvidence for evolutionary changes during invasionPhysiological adaptations to particular climatic conditions duringinvasion have been demonstrated in various plant species (e.g. Blair& Wolfe 2004; Dlugosch & Parker 2008). However, there is littleempirical evidence of such adaptation in animals (but see Huey et al.2000; Lee et al. 2011). Our study thus provides one of the fewempirical demonstrations that adaptive changes to a physiologicaltrait, cold tolerance in this case, may also lead to the establishmentand facilitate invasion by animal populations. Adaptation to coldallows W. auropunctata workers to continue foraging throughout theyear, even in the winter conditions of the Mediterranean climate ofIsrael, which is harsher than that of the tropical zone. Associatedwith invasive traits characterising all clonal populations (e.g. ecologi-cal dominance), tolerance to cold temperatures thus constitutes akey evolutionary shift crucial for the invasion of W. auropunctatapopulations established in this region.Phenotypic differentiation between the invasive and native popu-lations may also result from stochastic evolutionary change ratherthan adaptive changes in response to particular selection pressures(Keller & Taylor 2008). However, this seems unlikely in the case ofthe invasive Mediterranean populations of W. auropunctata. Indeed,our results indicate that cold tolerance, albeit of lower intensity, hasemerged independently in a genetically different invasive populationestablished in another remote geographical region (i.e. Florida), inresponse to similar cold selection pressure.When and where do evolutionary changes occur during invasionprocesses?This multidisciplinary approach showed that Israeli populationsfollowed a prior-adaptation invasion scenario, with adaptation tocold occurring before long-distance dispersal to Israel in popula-© 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS1270 Olivier Rey et al. Lettertions located at the southern margin of the native distribution ofthe species (i.e. northern Argentina). Israeli populations are geneti-cally similar to populations in northern Argentina, the latter facingwith similar cold selection pressure and displaying similar coldadaptation. On the contrary, the post-introduction adaptation sce-nario is unlikely in the case of W.auropunctata Israeli populations.Indeed, Israeli populations are characterised by only a single cou-ple of queen and male clonal genotypes most probably originatingfrom the same Argentinean population. Moreover, we found noevidence of admixture and/or mutation/recombination events inthe microsatellite multilocus genotypes of reproductives fromIsraeli populations compared to those sampled 5 years before byVonshak et al. (2009). In the same way, the bridgehead scenario isalso unlikely to explain the invasion of W. auropunctata in Israel.The unique cold-tolerant population identified that could haveserve as a bridgehead population for subsequent establishment inIsrael, i.e. Florida, was found to be genetically distinct from theIsraeli population.Figure 2 Consensus tree for the phylogeographical analyses based on mtDNA haplotypes.

See figure SS1 insupplementary information for site names and locations. The closely related species Wasmannia rochai (GenBank accession numbers EF459732 – EF759824) was used asan outgroup.© 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRSLetter Cold adaptation of an invasive ant 1271The nature of the evolutionary change (i.e. adaptive vs. stochastic)that has led to cold-tolerance in Argentinean populations, hence,promoting the establishment and the invasion of at least one inva-sive propagule in Israel, could not be unravelled precisely. Furtherstatistical analyses similar to those implemented by Keller et al.(2009), conducted on a sufficiently large number of populationsestablished in Argentina might be useful to clarify this point. How-ever, because cold tolerance emerged two times independently ingenetically distinct lineages established in a Mediterranean-like cli-mate (i.e. Argentina/Israel and Florida), the most parsimonioushypothesis is that cold tolerance resulted from adaptive changes.Interestingly, Florida most probably followed a scenario of invasiondifferent from the prior-adaption scenario. Although this scenariocannot be determined with the present data, this study supports theview that the invasion of a new environment may be achievedthrough different eco-evolutionary scenarios even at the intraspecificlevel.A role for prior adaptation within or at the margin of a species’native range in the invasion of remote locations by some popula-tions has been suggested in previous studies (e.g. Elton 1958), butlittle convincing evidence for this scenario has been obtained. Ourstudy is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate it unambigu-ously. Consistent with this scenario, the limits of the native rangesof organisms are often viewed as zones of habitat differentiationand heterogeneity, in which diverse evolutionary processes mayoccur (Kirkpatrick & Barton 1997; Thomas et al. 2001). Further-more, the potential to evolve in response to new conditions is likelyto be greater within or at the edge of the native range than in theintroduced range, due to larger effective population sizes, geneticvariation and propagule pressure over evolutionary time scales(Hufbauer et al. 2012).This study challenges the noteworthy small proportion of prior-adaptation suggested in the literature relative to the post-introduc-tion invasion scenario (but see Bossdorf et al. 2008). The scarcity of(a) (b)Figure 3 NJ dendrograms of the microsatellite allele shared distances between individual queens (a) and males (b).

Letterempirical studies unambiguously illustrating the prior adaptationinvasion scenario may reflect a lack of informative data (Hufbaueret al. 2012). More integrative studies, such as that described here,are required to improve our knowledge of the eco-evolutionary sce-narios underlying invasions. A frequent association of prior adapta-tion with invasion in remote locations would provide furtherevidence against the apparent paradox of invasion that some popu-lations characterised by low levels of adaptive genetic diversity areable to adapt to local abiotic conditions in a new habitat (Allendorf& Lundquist 2003).Benefits of a multidisciplinary approach for determiningeco-evolutionary scenarios of invasionMany studies have reported phenotypic divergence between nativeand invasive populations (e.g. Blair & Wolfe 2004; Bossdorf et al.2008), but only a few have carried out genetic analyses to determinethe exact source of invasive populations (but see Xu et al. 2010).This limitation is generally overcome by the comparison of numer-ous samples of native and invasive populations, assuming that thesampled populations broadly reflect the entire niche of the species(Dlugosch & Parker 2008). However, in the absence of preciseknowledge about the genotypes introduced, patterns of adaptivechange within invasive populations must be interpreted with cau-tion, because the use of this approach alone may result in erroneousconclusions. In the case of W. auropunctata, a comparison of theMediterranean invasive populations with arbitrarily sampled tropicalnative populations might have led to the conclusion that adaptationto cold occurred locally after introduction (i.e. following a post-introduction adaptation scenario).Genetic approaches are useful for (1) tracing the route of invasionand, hence, for identifying source populations and (2) highlightingdemographic events associated with invasion processes (see Estoup& Guillemaud 2010 for review). However, genetic tools provide noinformation about whether invasive populations face new selectionpressures and whether evolutionary changes occur during the inva-sion process. For example, Ascunce et al. (2011) used geneticapproaches to demonstrate that invasive populations of the fire ant,Solenopsis invicta, established in Florida behaved as source populationsfrom which propagules dispersed and established new populations inremote locations, such as New Zealand and China. However, itremains unknown whether invasion in these remote locations is asso-ciated with key evolutionary changes within Florida following abridgehead scenario. In W. auropunctata, the use of genetic approachesalone would have led to the identification of the Argentinean popula-tions as the source of invasive populations established in the Mediter-ranean region, but would not have provided any information aboutthe adaptive changes underlying the invasion of these populations.Finally, the species distribution models initially used to predictthe biogeographical invasion potential of some species (Peterson(a) (b)Figure 4 (a) Fits of non-linear mixed models using Gompertz functions for the proportion of workers recovering at each observation time for each of the sixbiogeographical areas. (b) Comparison of Gompertz function parameters estimated for each biogeographical area, for the parameter plateau at the top, and parameter d atthe bottom (see text for details). Closed symbols correspond to populations used to test whether adaptation occurred in the Mediterranean populations compared topopulations established in the core habitat of the native range. Open symbols correspond to the populations used for more specifically studying the location at whichcold adaptation occurred, based on the results obtained in SDM and genetic analyses (see Figs 1, 2 and 3).© 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRSLetter Cold adaptation of an invasive ant 12732003) have recently been used to determine whether and where cli-mate niche shifts occur during invasion (e.g. Broennimann et al.2007; Angetter et al. 2011). These approaches may provide informa-tion about whether invasive populations face new selection pres-sures likely to promote adaptive changes. For instance, Fitzpatricket al. (2007) suggested that some populations of S. invicta originatingfrom the southern margin of the native range of the species invadedcertain sites in the United States at which climatic conditions weresimilar to those of the native range, subsequently colonising colderenvironments within the introduced range. However, these authorsneither identified the source populations giving rise to the invasivepopulations, nor investigated whether and where potential adaptivechanges occurred during the invasion processes. In W. auropunctata,the use of SDM approaches would have suggested that populationsestablished in the Mediterranean zone (i.e. Israel) probably origi-nated from already adapted populations established in Argentina(i.e. margin prior-adaptation scenario) or Florida (i.e. bridgeheadscenario), but would not have made it possible to distinguishbetween these two origins.CONCLUSIONDetermining whether and where adaptive changes occur duringinvasion is challenging. As first suggested by Hufbauer et al.(2012) and demonstrated here, several complementary approachesare required. We propose an efficient and general methodologicalprocedure for focusing more directly on the key populations tobe studied, to decipher unambiguously the eco-evolutionary inva-sion scenario. First, it is important to identify particular selectionpressures within the invasive range that may have induced adap-tive changes to a given phenotypic trait in the introduced popula-tions. Species distribution models can then be used to identifypossible sites at which native and introduced populations facesimilar selection pressures. With the increasing use of SDMapproaches in biology, the available data sets will undoubtedlybecome increasingly appropriate for addressing questions relatingto biological invasions, including adaptation to biotic features (i.e.biotic interactions). Second, genetic approaches are crucial fortracing the route of invasions and identifying the source popula-tions giving rise to invasive populations. Population sampling forgenetic analyses should focus specifically on populations estab-lished within the geographical regions identified by SDM,although other population samples are also required for the analy-sis. Ultimately, phenotypic analyses are required to determinewhether adaptive changes occur during the invasion process.These analyses should be designed so as to include populationsestablished in the native core habitat of the species and popula-tions identified as the potential source population of the targetedinvasive population in genetic and SDM analyses. We believe thatserial processing via these three steps is crucial to determineunequivocally the eco-evolutionary invasion scenario. We hopethat this study will inspire future research on invasive speciesfrom other taxa, thus improving general knowledge concerningbiological invasion processes.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSWe would like to thank R.

Results: According to the MESS analysis, the North-Eastern region of Argentina and Florida display climatic characteristics, in terms of coldness, similar to those of the locations at which W. auropunctata occurs in Israel. To a lower extent, other regions of Mexico and South USA also display locally similar cold temperatures according to the MESS analysis.

Appendix S2: Projection of the climatic envelop modeled from A) urban areas and populated places in the geographic region of Israel and B) the entire geographic region of Israel (the geographic region defined in the main text, see Figure 1B), in South and Central America according to the multivariate environmental similarity surface approach (MESS) developed  by Elith et al. (2010). The MESS analysis was performed using MAXENT (Phillips et al. 2006). These analyses allowed simulating a situation of pseudo-equilibrium of W. auropunctata distribution with regards to climate in Israel. The first criterion (i.e. urban areas and populated places) was first adopted because W. auropunctata is known to be intimately associated with human-modified habitats in its area of introduction, particularly in Israel (Vonshak et al. 2009). The land-use information allowing defining urban areas and populated places was obtained from the Natural Earth website: http://www.naturalearthdata.com/). The second criterion (overall the geographic region of Israel) was adopted to simulate an extreme (most likely largely overestimated) situation of equilibrium where W. auropunctata is able to settle in the entire geographic region of Israel.  The color legend corresponds to the MESS index showing similarity (positive values with higher degree of similarity ranging from blue to red colours) and dissimilarity (negative values with lower degree of similarity ranging from blue to yellow colours), with the climatic envelop modelled from A) all urban areas and populated places in Israel and B) the entire geographic region of Israel.  Both climatic envelops were projected worldwide and lead to conclusions similar to those found in the manuscript (data not shown).     Results: According to both MESS analyses, the North-Eastern region of Argentina and Florida display climatic characteristics, in terms of coldness, similar to those of A) the urban areas and populated places in Israel and B) the entire geographic region of Israel. To a lower extent, other regions of Mexico and South USA also display locally similar cold temperatures according to the MESS analyses. Yet, no W. auropunctata occurrences are known in these regions.  Appendix S3: Details on the amplification and sequencing protocols of the mitochondrial DNA of cytochrome oxydase (COI) sequences.   LCO and HCO universal primers (Folmer et al. 1994) were used for 97 individual DNA to PCR amplify a 710 bp fragment. However, we did not obtain any PCR product with this set of primer for 39 individuals from several localities (i.e. French Guiana, Guiana, Peru, Brazil, Panama, Surinam, Ecuador, Paraguay, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica and Coco Island). For these individuals, we combined the LCO primer with a new designed internal Reverse primer called newCOI-R (TGY-TGG-TAT-AAA-ATA-GGG-TCT-C) to amplify a 700 pb DNA fragment. For both sets of primers we used the same PCR mixtures as in Foucaud et al. (2007). Thermal cycling conditions were as follows: denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, then 37 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C (48°C for LCO/newCOI-R primer set) for 1 min, and extension at 74 °C for 1 min, followed by a final extension at 74 °C for 10 min. PCR products were purified and sequenced on an ABI 3730 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Individual electropherograms were checked for eventual errors using Seqscape software (Applied Biosystems).

Appendix S5: Details and results of statistical analyses based on general linear mixed models using both the proportion of surviving workers and time to reach half the maximal proportion of recovered workers after cold stress as response variables.   Analytical methods: We assessed the effect of the biogeographic origin of each population on the maximal proportion of surviving workers observed throughout the experiment and the time to reach half the maximal proportion of surviving workers. The maximal proportion of surviving workers in populations was determined regardless of the time at which this maximum was reached. The biogeographic origin of each population was included as a categorical fixed factor (six levels: native area in natural habitats, native area in human-modified habitats, area of introduction in tropical zone, Florida in subtropical zone, Argentina in subtropical zone and area of introduction in the Mediterranean zone), whereas run number and population locality (nested in the “biogeographic origin” factor) were considered as random factors. For the maximal proportion of surviving workers, we used a general linear mixed model to consider binomial error terms and Laplace approximation to estimate parameters. The significance of the fixed factor was assessed in a likelihood ratio test. We used generalized linear mixed models (using GLMER in R) to assess the effect of the origin of each population on the time to reach half the maximal proportion of surviving workers. Gaussian error terms were considered and we used restricted maximum likelihood approximation (REML) to estimate parameters. The significance of the fixed factor was assessed in a likelihood ratio test. We then compared the time taken to reach half the maximal proportion of surviving workers for each origin of populations in Student's t tests.    Results Maximal proportion of surviving workers after cold shock The table below indicates the mean proportions of surviving workers from populations of different biogeographic origins after cold shock at 2°C for 16 hours and the results of the general linear mixed model for populations from the introduced area in the Mediterranean region (Israel) as the baseline level.

Time to reach half the maximal proportion of surviving workers was significantly shorter for Israeli populations (mean = 42.60) than for tropical introduced populations (mean = 111.73, p-value = 1.57x10-6) or populations originating from the native area, whatever the type of habitat (human-modified habitat: mean = 86.87, p-value = 1.82x10-4 or natural habitat: mean = 117.5, p-value = 3.80x10-5). Workers from populations established in Florida (mean = 81.0, p-value = 7.54x10-5) recovered also slower than workers from Israeli populations. It seems that workers from Argentina recovered faster (mean = 14.49) than all populations tested in this study. However,  this result must be interpreted carefully as these Argentinean populations were tested independently at the SABCL laboratory (Buenos Aires, Argentina) and this measure (i.e. time to reach half the maximal proportion of surviving workers after cold stress) is sensible to how workers were considered by observers as recovered.

Anthropogenically induced adaptation to invade hypothesis,100027538,Blackwell Publishing LtdThe evolutionary consequences of biological invasions,,"Andrew V. Suarez, Neil D. Tsutsui",2014,"A major challenge of invasion biology is the development of a predictive framework that prevents new invasions. This is inherently difficult because different biological character-istics are important at the different stages of invasion: opportunity/transport, establish-ment and spread. Here, we draw from recent research on a variety of taxa to examine the evolutionary causes and consequences of biological invasions. The process of introduction may favour species with characteristics that promote success in highly disturbed, human-dominated landscapes, thus exerting novel forms of selection on introduced populations. Moreover, evidence is accumulating that multiple introductions can often be critical to the successful establishment and spread of introduced species, as they may be important sources of genetic variation necessary for adaptation in new environments or may permit the introduction of novel traits. Thus, not only should the introduction of new species be prevented, but substantial effort should also be directed to preventing the secondary introduction of previously established species (and even movement of individuals among introduced populations). Modern molecular techniques can take advantage of genetic changes postintroduction to determine the source of introduced populations and their vectors of spread, and to elucidate the mechanisms of success of some invasive species. Moreover, the growing availability of genomic tools will permit the identification of underlying genetic causes of invasive success",,text,"adaptation, behaviour, genetic drift, hybridization, invasive species",,
Anthropogenically induced adaptation to invade hypothesis,484292564,Elucidating the Joint Effects of Biotic and Abiotic Factors on Species Invasion: A Trait-based Approach,,"Simon, Margaret",2017,"Species invasions present a major environmental challenge due to their negative impacts on biodiversity, natural and agricultural ecosystems, and human health. Climate warming increases rates of invasion, but the field lacks a full understanding of the processes generating this pattern.  To mitigate the negative effects of warming-facilitated invasions, we must understand the role that temperature plays in invasion success. A critical component of this agenda is to understand the effects of temperature on the invasion of ectothermic species in particular, as a large proportion of high-impacting pest and pathogen invaders are ectotherms. A successful invasion requires that an invader colonize the thermal environment, as well as establish into the biotic environment, the latter of which exposes the invader to competitive and antagonistic interactions with native residents. Because temperature affects both invader colonization and establishment, ectotherm invasions represent a complex interplay between temperature, invader persistence, and biotic interactions.	Here we develop a conceptual framework for predicting the outcome of such complexity. The framework links the thermal environment to ectotherm population dynamics and interactions through impacts of temperature on life history and interaction traits. We integrate the temperature response of these traits into delay differential equations to make mechanistic predictions regarding the effects of warming on stage-structured populations and community-level dynamics. We use the framework to examine the effect of temperature on exotic invasion success by characterizing the fundamental thermal niche of an invader and the ways in which a resident competitor might constrain the thermal niche. We then ask how climate warming impacts these invasions.	Within the fundamental thermal niche of ectotherms, we find that high temperatures maximize the probability of colonization, but low temperatures maximize invader abundance. We find that ectotherms adapted to low latitudes (tropical climates) are more successful invaders of high latitudes (temperate climates) as compared to the other way around. Further, we find that warming can allow tropical invaders to establish when they could not under ambient temperate climates. Taken together, the dissertation clarifies our understanding of the mechanisms by which exotic species insert themselves into native communities under ambient and warming climates",,etd,Ecology,,"eScholarship, University of California"

We evaluate evidence for population differentiation, natural selection and adaptive evolution of invading plants and animals at two nested spatial scales: (i) among introduced populations (ii) between native and introduced genotypes. Evolution during invasion is frequently inferred, but rarely confirmed as adaptive. In common garden studies, quantitative trait differentiation is only marginally lower (~3.5%) among introduced relative to native populations, despite genetic bottlenecks and shorter timescales (i.e. millennia vs. decades). However, differentiation between genotypes from the native vs. introduced range is less clear and confounded by nonrandom geographic sampling; simulations suggest this causes a high false-positive discovery rate (>50%) in geographically structured populations. Selection differentials (¦s¦) are stronger in introduced than in native species, although selection gradients (¦β¦) are not, consistent with introduced species experiencing weaker genetic constraints. This could facilitate rapid adaptation, but evidence is limited. For example, rapid phenotypic evolution often manifests as geographical clines, but simulations demonstrate that nonadaptive trait clines can evolve frequently during colonization (~two-thirds of simulations). Additionally, QST-FST studies may often misrepresent the strength and form of natural selection acting during invasion. Instead, classic approaches in evolutionary ecology (e.g. selection analysis, reciprocal transplant, artificial selection) are necessary to determine the frequency of adaptive evolution during invasion and its influence on establishment, spread and impact of invasive species. These studies are rare but crucial for managing biological invasions in the context of global change",,Article,"Adaptation, Contemporary Evolution, Invasive Species, Quantitative Genetics, Ecological Genetics, Natural Selection and Contemporary Evolution",,
Anthropogenically induced adaptation to invade hypothesis,214784608,Progress toward understanding the ecological impacts of non-native species,,"Ricciardi, Anthony, Hoopes, Martha F., Marchetti, Michael",2013,"A predictive understanding of the ecological impacts of nonnative species has been slow to develop, owing largely to an apparent dearth of clearly defined hypotheses and the lack of a broad theoretical framework. The context dependency of impact has fueled the perception that meaningful generalizations are nonexistent. Here, we identified and reviewed 19 testable hypotheses that explain temporal and spatial variation in impact. Despite poor validation of most hypotheses to date, evidence suggests that each can explain at least some impacts in some situations. Several hypotheses are broad in scope (applying to plants and animals in virtually all contexts) and some of them, intriguingly, link processes of colonization and impact. Collectively, these hypotheses highlight the importance of the functional ecology of the nonnative species and the structure, diversity, and evolutionary experience of the recipient community as general determinants of impact; thus, they could provide the foundation for a theoretical framework for understanding and predicting impact. Further substantive progress toward this goal requires explicit consideration of within-taxon and across-taxa variation in the per capita effect of invaders, and analyses of complex interactions between invaders and their biotic and abiotic environments",,text,"biological invasion, context dependence, ecological impact, invasive species, niche theory, prediction, risk assessment, Biology, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology",,Saint Mary\u27s Digital Commons
Anthropogenically induced adaptation to invade hypothesis,108805753,Interaction of Species Traits and Environmental Disturbance Predicts Invasion Success of Aquatic,,Elvira Mächler Florian,2012,"Factors such as increased mobility of humans, global trade and climate change are affecting the range of many species, and cause large-scale translocations of species beyond their native range. Many introduced species have a strong negative influence on the new local environment and lead to high economic costs. There is a strong interest to understand why some species are successful in invading new environments and others not. Most of our understanding and generalizations thereof, however, are based on studies of plants and animals, and little is known on invasion processes of microorganisms. We conducted a microcosm experiment to understand factors promoting the success of biological invasions of aquatic microorganisms. In a controlled lab experiment, protist and rotifer species originally isolated in North America invaded into a natural, field-collected community of microorganisms of European origin. To identify the importance of environmental disturbances on invasion success, we either repeatedly disturbed the local patches, or kept them as undisturbed controls. We measured both short-term establishment and long-term invasion success, and correlated it with species-specific life-history traits. We found that environmental disturbances significantly affected invasion success. Depending on the invading species ’ identity, disturbances were either promoting or decreasing invasion success. The interaction between habitat disturbance and species identity was especially pronounced for long-term invasion success. Growth rate was the most important trait promoting invasion success, especially when the species invaded into a disturbed local community. W",,text,,,

Becker, Daniel G, Sonia Altizer",2016,"Urbanisation and agriculture cause declines for many wildlife, but some species benefit from novel resources, especially food, provided in human-dominated habitats. Resulting shifts in wildlife ecol-ogy can alter infectious disease dynamics and create opportunities for cross-species transmission, yet predicting host–pathogen responses to resource provisioning is challenging. Factors enhancing transmission, such as increased aggregation, could be offset by better host immunity due to improved nutrition. Here, we conduct a review and meta-analysis to show that food provisioning results in highly heterogeneous infection outcomes that depend on pathogen type and anthropo-genic food source. We also find empirical support for behavioural and immune mechanisms through which human-provided resources alter host exposure and tolerance to pathogens. A review of recent theoretical models of resource provisioning and infection dynamics shows that changes in host contact rates and immunity produce strong non-linear responses in pathogen inva-sion and prevalence. By integrating results of our meta-analysis back into a theoretical frame-work, we find provisioning amplifies pathogen invasion under increased host aggregation and tolerance, but reduces transmission if provisioned food decreases dietary exposure to parasites.

Anthropogenically induced adaptation to invade hypothesis,163114776,The effect of environmental fluctuations – Could climate change promote species’ invasion success?,10.17011/conference/eccb2018/108130,"Räsänen, Emmi, Ketola, Tarmo, Lindström, Leena",2018,"The global climate change is presumed to increase the amount of fluctuations in the environmental conditions. This could increase the amount of species invasion into new areas if fluctuations affect the ecological and evolutionary processes that make species successful as invaders, and native communities and their environments more susceptible to invasions1. Disturbed environments are assumed to be more prone to invasions and the fluctuations in invasive species’ home range could pre-adapt them to tolerate similar conditions elsewhere. Under fluctuating conditions, natural selection could potentially favor traits like generalism, which is profitable in adaptation to wide range of conditions2. These attributes could lead to better competitive ability of the invader against the native species, especially if the native species are mal-adapted to tolerate fluctuating conditions. Moreover, the distant relatedness between the invasive species and its native competitors is hypothesized to reduce their competition for the same resources and so increase the success of the invader3. We tested these theories of how fast environmental fluctuations and relatedness of species could affect the invasion success, with our aim to find effects that would be generalizable over the species. In this study, the invasion success meant the ability of the invader population to competitively displace the population of its competitor species. Bacterial species that had evolved in stable or fluctuating temperature were competed against the dominant bacterial invader Serratia marcescens, which had also evolved in stable or fluctuating temperature and the invasions were initiated in environments with similarly stable or fluctuating temperature. In addition, the competitor species were differently related to the invader. The results indicated strong species-specific effects on invasion success, which could be due to the more intense competition detected between closely related species. For most of the species, the rapid temperature fluctuations during invasion made invasions more successful. Unexpectedly, the evolution in the fluctuating environment did not significantly enhance the success of S. marcescens. Instead, our study showed that under fast fluctuations, natural selection could select for generalist genotypes, which invade better also in suboptimal environments. We found the superiority of S. marcescens also when its competitor species had mal-adapted to tolerate thermal fluctuations, but this result was strongly affected by one species. Overall, our results indicate that in the future, the traits of the invader, the attributes of its native competitors and the environmental conditions during invasion need to be considered together when predicting the success of the invasive species under fluctuating conditions.  1.

It is increasingly recognized that the factors facilitating plant invasions depend on the stage along the introduction–naturalization–invasion continuum. Adaptative strategies, that is, combinations of functional traits that represent overall fitness in the face of one or more selection pressures, have shown promise in explaining plant invasions. However, whether adaptive strategy patterns change with stages of plant invasion is not yet known.2. Using the Pladias Database of the Czech Flora and Vegetation, we explored how Grime's adaptive strategies (competitors, stress-tolerators, ruderals; CSR) and introduction pathways (deliberate vs. accidental) relate to plant invasion along the introduction–naturalization–invasion continuum.3. Phylogenetically corrected ANOVAs showed that naturalized species (referring to non-invasive naturalized species in this study) were mostly R-selected, whereas invasive species tended to be C-selected. The results of phylogenetic regression analysis further confirmed that across the deliberately and accidentally introduced species, R- and C-selection were positively related to naturalization and invasion success respectively. We also found that deliberate introduction was negatively related to naturalization success and grid-cell occupancy of naturalized species, likely due to the different CSR strategies of deliberately and accidentally introduced aliens.4. Our study provides empirical evidence that different adaptive strategies are associated with species that have reached different invasion stages and confirms the usefulness of the CSR strategy framework for understanding plant invasion. This has implications for predicting and preventing potential high-impact invaders. For example, our results show that naturalized C-selected species have a higher probability of becoming invasive than naturalized R-selected species. Therefore, management actions are essential to prevent further introductions and spread of competitors.publishe",,info:eu-repo/semantics/article,"alien species, Grime's adaptive strategy, introduction pathways, introduction–naturalization– invasion continuum, invasion stages, info:eu-repo/classification/ddc/570",,'Wiley'

In the context of invasion ecology, macroecological studies include, for example, analyses of the richness, diversity, distribution, and abundance of alien species in regional floras and faunas, spatio-temporal dynamics of alien species across regions, and cross-taxonomic analyses of species traits among comparable native and alien species pools. However, macroecological studies aiming to explain and predict plant and animal naturalisations and invasions, and the resulting impacts, have, to date, rarely considered the joint effects of species traits, environment, and socioeconomic characteristics. To address this, we present the MAcroecological Framework for Invasive Aliens (MAFIA). The MAFIA explains the invasion phenomenon using three interacting classes of factors – alien species traits, location characteristics, and factors related to introduction events – and explicitly maps these interactions onto the invasion sequence from transport to naturalisation to invasion. The framework therefore helps both to identify how anthropogenic effects interact with species traits and environmental characteristics to determine observed patterns in alien distribution, abundance, and richness; and to clarify why neglecting anthropogenic effects can generate spurious conclusions. Event-related factors include propagule pressure, colonisation pressure, and residence time that are important for mediating the outcome of invasion processes. However, because of context dependence, they can bias analyses, for example those that seek to elucidate the role of alien species traits. In the same vein, failure to recognise and explicitly incorporate interactions among the main factors impedes our understanding of which macroecological invasion patterns are shaped by the environment, and of the importance of interactions between the species and their environment. The MAFIA is based largely on insights from studies of plants and birds, but we believe it can be applied to all taxa, and hope that it will stimulate comparative research on other groups and environments. By making the biases in macroecological analyses of biological invasions explicit, the MAFIA offers an opportunity to guide assessments of the context dependence of invasions at broad geographical scales",,Research Article,"climate, colonisation pressure, geographic range, habitats, invasion stages, non-native, propagule pressure, residence time, species traits, vertebrates",,Pensoft Publishers

In the invasiveant Wasmannia auropunctata, however, a shift in reproductive system has beendemonstrated within the native range, from the sexual non-dominant popula-tions of natural habitats to the clonal dominant populations of human-modifiedhabitats. Because abiotic conditions of human- modified habitats are hotter anddryer, we performed lab experiments on workers from a set of native and intro-duced populations, to investigate whether these ecological and genetic transitionswere accompanied by a change in thermotolerance and whether such changesoccurred before establishment in the introduced range. Thermotolerance levelswere higher in native populations from human-modified habitats than in nativepopulations from natural habitats, but were similar in native and introducedpopulations from human-modified habitats. Differences in thermotolerancecould not be accounted for by differences in body size. A scenario based on localadaptation in the native range before introduction in remote areas represents themost parsimonious hypothesis to account for the observed phenotypic pattern.These findings highlight the importance of human land use in explaining majorcontemporary evolutionary changes.IntroductionMost recent studies trying to decipher the reasons for thesuccess of invasive species have explicitly focused on theintroduced range of invasive species (Richardson et al.2000; Sakai et al. 2001; Colautti and MacIsaac 2004). Thisis logical given that post-introduction ecological and evolu-tionary challenges are likely to be more important thanthose occurring before long-distance dispersal. After theirintroduction into a new area, founding individuals gener-ally have to cope with new demographic and/or environ-mental conditions when compared to their native habitats.New demographic conditions, such as Allee effects orgenetic drift in small populations, can hamper successfulestablishment (Sakai et al. 2001). New biotic and abioticconditions can also constitute severe barriers to successfulinvasions (Blackburn et al. 2011).

The role of pre-adaptation (or prior adaptations, see Hufbauer et al.2012) of certain native populations to explain invasivesuccess has not received adequate attention (van Kleunenet al. 2011), despite early studies underlying this possi-bility (Elton 1958). In particular, native populationsadapted to human- modified habitats may be particu-larly prone to become invasive elsewhere (Ehrlich 1989).Human activities are now widely recognized as a majorforce promoting biological invasions (e.g. King andTschinkel 2008; Leprieur et al. 2008), both throughlarge-scale transport (Floerl and Inglis 2005; Suarez et al.2005; Tatem et al. 2006) and biotic homogenization (e.g.McKinney and Lockwood 1999; Olden et al. 2004; Mc-Kinney 2006). Human activities provide native specieswith an opportunity to cross habitat boundaries locally,and to adapt to human- driven biotic and abiotic condi-tions within their native range (i.e., pre-adapt). In addi-tion to triggering a general decrease in speciesabundance, functional diversity and other biotic effects(Olden et al. 2004; Ekroos et al. 2010), human activitiestend to alter the abiotic properties of habitats, such assoil chemical and physical features, water resources andproperties, air filtering, light incidence, and climatic con-ditions (Pickett et al. 2001; Kozlov and Zvereva 2007;Hrodey et al. 2009). Native populations adapting locallyto such profound changes to their environment maysubsidiarily benefit from the opportunity for long-dis-tance dispersal provided by human activities. Forinstance, the worldwide airline transportation networkprovides numerous high capacity routes between geo-graphically distant, but climatically similar locations(Tatem and Hay 2007). Native species that adapted tohuman- modified habitats are thus likely to access newareas characterized by similar habitat alterations, poten-tially multiple times, following human-driven introduc-tion events (e.g. McKinney 2006; Foucaud et al. 2010;Hufbauer et al. 2012).Although the idea of human activities promoting inva-sion success through prior adaptations in the nativerange is not new (Elton 1958; Ehrlich 1989), a renewedattention has been turned to the study of the nativerange and evolutionary changes occurring before intro-duction (Lee and Gelembiuk 2008; Valery et al. 2009;Schlaepfer et al. 2010; Hufbauer et al. 2012). However,this interest has been mostly theoretical, and the impor-tance of prior adaptations to human-modified habitatsin generating successful invaders has seldom been stud-ied using natural populations (van Kleunen et al. 2010).Notable exceptions are studies comparing life-historytraits between native populations of invasive and non-invasive species (Chown et al. 2007; Schlaepfer et al.2010; Jenkins and Keller 2011; van Kleunen et al. 2011),or population history of native populations differing intheir physiological ability to invade novel habitats (Win-kler et al. 2008). These studies all underline the impor-tance of prior adaptations to human-modified, marginal,or fluctuating habitats within the native range inexplaining successful invasions events. However, the rela-tive contribution of prior adaptation and other processes(multiple introductions, post-introduction adaptation) toinvasion success remains speculative, given the scarcityof experimental studies of native populations of invasivespecies.Wasmannia auropunctata, an invasive ant speciesranked among the most destructive invaders worldwide(Lowe et al. 2000), presents the opportunity to test forthe hypothesis of important adaptations occurring withinthe native range before long-distance introductions. Pre-vious studies have shown that this ant underwent majorbiological shifts within its native range before the long-distance dispersal events leading to worldwide invasion.In natural areas of its native range (primary forests ofSouth America), W. auropunctata forms low-densitypopulations (Orivel et al. 2009). However, this ant hasalso successfully colonized human- modified habitatswithin its native range, and this habitat change was par-alleled by a striking switch in ecological dominance (butnot in social system; Foucaud et al. 2009; Orivel et al.2009). A switch in reproductive system also took placeat the time of habitat transition: primary forest popula-tions generally display a classical haplo-diploid reproduc-tive system (hereafter referred to as ‘sexual’), whereaspopulations from human-modified areas are almostentirely clonal, with a strong reduction in genetic vari-ability (Foucaud et al. 2007). All introduced populationsstudied to date appear to be drawn from dominant pop-ulations of human-modified habitats of the native rangeof the species (Foucaud et al. 2010), suggesting that eco-logical and reproductive shifts occurred within the nativerange before long-distance dispersal.We have previously shown that abiotic conditions dif-fer considerably between the natural and human-modi-fied environments of W. auropunctata in its native range(Orivel et al. 2009). Over the course of the year, tem-perature remains stable at values below 30°C andhumidity never drops below 80% in natural habitats,whereas in human-modified habitats, temperatures mayreach 40°C and humidity may drop to 50%. The workercaste, in charge of the foraging outside the colony, maybe particularly affected by these conditions. These722 © 2013 The Authors. Evolutionary Applications published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd 6 (2013) 721–734Thermotolerance adaptation in the native range Foucaud et al.abiotic differences clearly constitute a major ecologicalchallenge, which has apparently been met by somenative W. auropunctata populations. However, it remainsunknown whether populations from natural andhuman-modified habitats differ in their ability to toler-ate hot and dry abiotic conditions (hereafter referred toas ‘thermotolerance’, sensu lato), and whether putativedifferences in thermotolerance stem from local adapta-tion (Dybdahl and Kane 2005; Preisser et al. 2008) orphenotypic plasticity (Chown et al. 2007; Nya-mukondiwa et al. 2010).If both native and introduced populations from human-modified habitats can tolerate such conditions, and nativepopulations from natural habitats cannot, this would sup-port the scenario of an evolutionary shift in the nativerange before long-distance dispersal into the introducedrange. This has previously been shown to occur for lowerthermal limits of W. auropunctata, with a prior adaptationto cold in populations from Argentina, which allowed asuccessful remote introduction of the species in the Medi-terranean zone (Rey et al. 2012).A possible way for certain populations to tolerate diffi-cult abiotic conditions could be to display variation inworker body size. Worker body size has been shown to playan important role in thermotolerance in several ant species(Kaspari 1993). In particular, Cataglyphis velox workers,desert ants that have to deal with extreme heat, have beendemonstrated to make use of their large body size to forageat higher temperatures (Cerda and Retana 1997, 2000). InW. auropunctata, previous studies have shown that workersfrom populations established in the introduced range aresmaller than those found in the native range (McGlynn1999; Mikheyev and Mueller 2007). However, these studiesdid not compare the body sizes of native and introducedworkers originating from populations established in differ-ent habitats (i.e., natural versus human-modified habitats,as in this study).The main goal of this study was to investigate a putativeevolutionary shift within the native range before long-dis-tance dispersal that may indicate prior adaptation of cer-tain native populations to become invasive. We tackled thisquestion by testing in the laboratory the putative differ-ences in upper thermotolerance levels between a set ofnative populations from natural and human-modified hab-itats and introduced populations from human-modifiedhabitats. All tested populations have been genetically char-acterized at microsatellite markers to assess the genetic rela-tionships among them and among other worldwidepopulations. We further investigated whether observedthermotolerance differences were due to body size varia-tions. The possibility of prior adaptation to human-modi-fied habitats within the native range in explaining invasivesuccess is finally discussed.Materials and methodsSampling of live populations and setting of laboratorycoloniesWe collected ca. 140 queens and several thousand workersfrom 11 populations from natural and human-modifiedhabitats within the native range (i.e., French Guiana) andthe introduced range (i.e., Cameroon, Florida and NewCaledonia) of W. auropunctata (Fig. 1, Table 1) betweenDecember 2007 and March 2008.On the basis of our previous genetic studies of the sam-pled populations, we expected three of the sampled popula-tions to be sexual and eight to be clonal (Foucaud et al.2006, 2007). This was confirmed by genotyping a mini-mum of three queens and 30 workers from each populationat 33 microsatellite loci, as described in Fournier et al.(2005b) and Almany et al. (2009). The reproductive systemwas determined by visually inspecting genotypes and usinga program to identify identical multilocus genotypes thatwe had developed in Pascal object programming language(available upon request to the authors; see Foucaud et al.2007; Fournier et al. 2005a).All the populations sampled from natural habitats weresexual, whereas all the populations sampled in human-modified habitats were clonal: the factors ‘habitat’ and‘reproductive system’ are thus confounded. In previousstudies (e.g. Foucaud et al. 2007), we encountered, on veryrare occasions, clonal populations in natural habitats (onlytwice in French Guiana) and sexual populations in human-modified habitats (only once in French Guiana). As thesetypes of populations are extremely rare and difficult tosample, we were unable to include them in this study. Fur-thermore, clonal populations from natural habitats have sofar been sampled only from the canopy, whereas sexualpopulations are found only at ground level. It thereforeseems likely that clonal and sexual populations from natu-ral habitats do not share the same ecological niche. Wewere thus unable to assess the interaction between habitatand reproductive system in this study, essentially because itwas seldom present in the field.We set up 11 laboratory colonies (Table 1), consisting ofmore than ten queens and at least 500 workers originatingfrom three to 10 nests sampled in locations known to har-bor a single population (Foucaud et al. 2009). We couldgather many queens in each of the laboratory coloniesbecause both sexual and clonal populations from the wholerange ofW. auropunctata are polygynous (i.e., no transitionfrom monogyny to polygyny occurred in the course of theinvasion process; Foucaud et al. 2009; Orivel et al. 2009).These laboratory colonies were kept in a climate chamberat a constant temperature of 25°C, with a humidity of 60%to 70%. Food (sugar water and worms) and water wereprovided ad libitum once per week.© 2013 The Authors. Evolutionary Applications published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd 6 (2013) 721–734 723Foucaud et al.

Evolutionary Applications published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd 6 (2013) 721–734Thermotolerance adaptation in the native range Foucaud et al.Genetic relationships between populations tested forthermotoleranceTo investigate the putative adaptive evolution of a trait, itis important to compare populations sharing sufficientlyclose genetic relationships (e.g. Hufbauer et al. 2012). Pre-vious genetic studies demonstrated that all sampled nativepopulations from human- modified habitats originatedrecently from sampled native populations from naturalhabitats (Foucaud et al. 2007).Previous genetic studies of worldwide introductionroutes did not enable to directly link any introduced popu-lation to its exact native source population (Foucaud et al.2010). This is mostly due to the strong genetic structureuncovered in the native range of the species (Foucaud et al.2007). To validate the comparison between the three testedintroduced populations (Cameroon, Florida, New Caledo-nia) and the tested native populations (French Guiana), weinvestigated whether these introduced populations weregenetically closer to three alternative sets of native popula-tions from Brazil, Costa Rica or French Guiana. To thisaim, we genotyped at least 30 individual workers per sam-pled native and introduced population at 12 microsatellitemarkers (Fournier et al. 2005b) and added this new dataset to a previous data set investigating the worldwidegenetic variation of W. auropunctata (Foucaud et al. 2010).We performed three distinct population genetics analysesusing this global microsatellite data set. We first used thesoftware POPULATIONS (Langella 2002) to construct a den-drogram connecting worker populations using the Neigh-bor-Joining (NJ) algorithm (Saitou and Nei 1987). Thegenetic distance used was Chakraborty and Jin’s allele-shared distance (Chakraborty and Jin 1993). This distancewas averaged over all pairs of individuals belonging to pair-wise populations in order to obtain the genetic distancesbetween populations. Bootstrap values (with the locus as aunit) were calculated over 1000 iterations. Extended major-ity rule was applied to reconstruct the consensus tree. Simi-lar results were obtained using other genetic distances(including Nei’s chord distance, Cavalli-Sforza & Edwardsdistance and the proportion of shared alleles; Bowcocket al. 1994; Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards 1967; Nei et al.1983) and reconstruction algorithms (UPGMA and BioNJ;Gascuel 1997). These additional phylogenetic reconstruc-tions were obtained using MSA 4.05 for the computationof 10 000 bootstrapped distance matrices (Dieringer andSchl€otterer 2003) and the neighbor and consense programsof the PHYLIP package v3.69 for the tree reconstruction (Fel-senstein 2004). As second analysis, we computed a matrixincluding pairwise FST values between all sampled popula-tions using the estimator h of the parameter FST (Weir andCockerham 1984). We also performed an AMOVA analysisusing ARLEQUIN 3.5 (Excoffier and Lischer 2010) to measurethe partition of genetic variance between the introducedpopulations collected for the thermotolerance experimentsand each of the available native populations (Brazil, CostaRica and Guiana). As third analysis, we performed anexclusion analysis using GeneClass2 (Piry et al. 2004) tofurther investigate which native populations were geneti-cally the most likely sources of the individual genotypes ofthe sampled introduced populations collected for the ther-motolerance experiments.Thermotolerance assaysWe assessed the tolerance of the workers to abiotic condi-tions in a resistance test in which mortality rate was deter-mined in groups of workers. We placed ten individualworkers in a Petri dish sealed with a grid cover and main-tained the workers for 3 h at constant temperature andhumidity conditions within a climate chamber. The num-ber of dead workers at the end of this 3-h period was usedas a measurement of the thermotolerance (sensu lato, i.e.,including both tolerance to high temperature and to lowhygrometric conditions). Mortality was assessed visually byfour experimenters that were randomized according totreatments and populations tested.Workers from laboratory colonies were tested more than40 days after sampling, to ensure that all the workers testedhad been produced in the laboratory and not sampled fromthe field (the life expectancy of W. auropunctata workers isabout 30 days, (Ulloa-Chacon 1990). This time lag to thestart of the experiments minimized the impact of the accli-mation factor in the interpretation of our results.

Similarexperiments carried out on workers from colonies housedin the laboratory for more than a year provided qualita-tively similar results, confirming that acclimation is unli-kely to account for our findings (data not shown).Preliminary experiments were conducted in the labora-tory on one sexual population from a natural habitat (M7)and one clonal population from a human-modified habitat(Ker), to determine the range of temperature and humidityconditions yielding moderate to high worker mortalityrates. We studied a total of 14 250 workers in 39 combina-tions of temperature (seven values from 25°C to 42°C) andhumidity conditions (seven values from 100% to 25%; seeFig. S1 for details). On the basis of the findings of thesepreliminary experiments, we chose four temperature andhumidity combinations giving moderate to high workermortality rates for the main experiment: 36°C – 55%, 38°C– 65%, 39°C – 70% and 40°C – 75%. According to the pre-liminary data (Fig. S2), the chosen temperature- humiditycombinations represent adequate conditions to detect dif-ferences in mortality between the two types of populations.During the main experiment following our preliminarytests, we tested a total of 8790 workers as follows. For eachof the four chosen sets of abiotic conditions, we tested all11 laboratory colonies twice, using ten Petri dishes of tenindividuals (i.e., 4 conditions * 11 colonies * ten Petridishes * two runs = 880 Petri dishes, minus one missing).All eight assays were conducted in the same climate cham-ber, in which two Petri dishes per colony per run wereplaced at random positions on five vertical racks. As before,we recorded the proportion of dead workers per Petri dish(i.e., the mortality rate). We performed a control consistingin holding one additional Petri dish per tested laboratorycolony (with 10 individual workers) at laboratory condi-tions (25°C – 60–70% RH) during the 3 h of each run, tomonitor putative mortality due to the treatment itself.Statistical analysis of thermotoleranceOur main goal was to investigate putative differences in abi-otic tolerance between populations of different origins(native natural, native human-modified and introducedhuman-modified), through the use of a statistical model.Explanatory variables consisted only in categorical factors.We used five categorical factors: ‘type’ (corresponding tothe three different types of habitat), ‘pop’ (the sampled pop-ulation), ‘cond’ (the tested temperature- humidity condi-tions), ‘rep’ (the number of the replicate, from one to two),and ‘rack’ (the vertical position of the Petri dish in the cli-mate chamber, from rack 1 to rack 5). Note that ‘pop’ wasnested within ‘type’ and that the variable ‘rep’ was nestedwithin ‘cond’ (hereafter denoted ‘pop(type)’ and ‘rep(cond)’). Both the ‘pop’ and ‘rep’ factors were treated asrandom effects, whereas the remaining factors (‘cond’, ‘rack’and ‘type’) were treated as fixed effects. For the purposes ofinterpretation, only the following interactions were includedin the full model: cond*type, cond*pop(type), rack*pop(type), rack*rep(cond) and rep(cond)*pop(type). Giventhat the response variable was a proportion, we assumed abinomial distribution.With fixed and random effects and a binomially distrib-uted independent variable, we ran a generalized linearmixed model with a logit link function (Zuur et al. 2009).We were principally interested in estimating the magnitudeof the difference in mortality rates between the three typesof population, while correcting for several clustering factors(e.g., population). We therefore used Penalized Quasi-Like-lihood methods (PQL; Breslow and Clayton 1993), asimplemented in SAS 9.1, to fit the model (PROC GLIM-MIX, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). PQL methods mayyield biased estimates of variance components in some situ-ations (Lin and Breslow 1996). However, on the basis ofprevious work (Breslow and Clayton 1993; Breslow and Lin1995; Bolker et al. 2009), we conclude that our estimatesmay only be subject to a negligible bias, given that (i) thedata were only slightly unbalanced, (ii) all fixed effectsreached high levels of significance, and (iii) all variancecomponent estimates were small (<0.36) and the overdi-spersion coefficient was moderate (1.53, see below). Thesignificance of fixed effects was assessed through approxi-mate F-tests and the number of denominator degrees offreedom for each test was computed using the Kenward-Roger approximation (Bolker et al. 2009).It is worth stressing that our full model yielded an esti-mate of 0 for the variance component of the interactionbetween replicate and vertical position within the climatechamber [i.e., ‘rack*rep(cond)’] and the interactionbetween the type of habitat and the conditions tested (i.e.,‘type*cond’) was clearly non-significant (F[6, 25.8] = 1.15,P = 0.36). Therefore, as suggested by Zuur et al. (2009),we fitted a second model from which these two terms wereremoved. With this model, the coefficient of overdispersionwas moderate (1.53 SE = 0.08), estimates of variance com-ponents were not large (i.e., 1; Lin and Breslow 1996)and all fixed effects other than the conditions tested(‘cond’) gave small P-values (see Table 2). This secondmodel was therefore selected for subsequent analyses.Effect of body size on thermotoleranceWe tested for a possible effect of body size on our thermotol-erance results, by investigating worker body size in fivenative populations – two from natural habitats (M3-F andM11) and three from human-modified habitats (Ker, P2-2and Cay) – and two introduced populations (New Caledo-nia and Australia). The introduced Australian population,726 © 2013 The Authors. Evolutionary Applications published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd 6 (2013) 721–734Thermotolerance adaptation in the native range Foucaud et al.which was not tested in our main thermotolerance assay, haspreviously been shown to be clonal Foucaud et al. 2010, andsubsequently to exhibit thermotolerance levels similar tothose of other introduced populations (results not shown).We collected and point-mounted 20 foraging workers fromeach population. Multifocus images (x40) of worker headswere acquired with a GT Entovision System and Archime-dTM software (Microvision Instruments, Evry, France).Four morphological parameters of the head were measuredon each worker (maximum head width, maximum headlength, and head width in front of and behind the eyes) withCartograph software (Microvision Instruments).Preliminary analysis showed that all morphometric mea-surements were highly correlated (all Pearson’s product-moment correlations > 0.66). Thus, as maximum headwidth is often considered a standard proxy for body size(H€olldobler and Wilson 1990), we used only this morpho-logical variable for subsequent analyses. After testing fornormality and variance homogeneity, we investigated puta-tive differences in body size between populations originat-ing from different habitats in both ranges (native natural,native human-modified, and introduced human-modi-fied), by fitting a linear mixed model implemented in R(R Development Core Team 2005) and including the fol-lowing factors: ‘type’ (fixed factor corresponding to ourthree types of population) and ‘pop’ (random factor corre-sponding to the sampled population, nested within ‘type’).We additionally investigated whether mean values ofthermotolerance were related to mean body size at thepopulation level for the six populations for which measure-ments were available for both traits. After checking forbinormality of the data, we conducted a Pearson’s product-moment correlation test using R.ResultsGenetic relationships between populationsThe NJ tree presented in Fig. 1B shows that the col-lected native Guianese populations group together withthe introduced populations used in our thermotoleranceexperiments (New Caledonia, Cameroon, and to a lesserextent Florida). The support for the deepest nodes ofthe tree was however low (bootstrap values below20%), due at least partly to a too low number of mi-crosatellite markers and an incomplete sampling giventhe substantial genetic structure at small geographicscale in the native range of this species Foucaud et al.2009;. Low node values were also somewhat expectedgiven the strong bottleneck events endured by clonalpopulations (i.e., an equivalent of only two effectiveindividuals, one haploid male and one diploid femaleand hence a maximum of three alleles per locus), likelynegatively influencing our ability to reconstruct a cor-rect phylogeny (Takezaki and Nei 1996; Estoup andGuillemaud 2010). All distances and reconstructionalgorithms however yielded similar topologies (resultsnot shown).The pairwise FST values calculated among all populationssampled in the distribution range of W. auropunctatashowed that our focal introduced populations used forthermotolerance experiments were genetically closer tonative Guianese populations than to any other samplednative populations (Brazil and Costa Rica; Fig. S2). Inagreement with this, the AMOVA analysis showed that theleast amount of genetic variance was partitioned betweenthe focal introduced populations and Guianese popula-tions: 5.52% of genetic variation versus 11.52% and12.44% for the Brazilian and Costa Rican populations,respectively.Exclusion analysis results indicated that all native pop-ulations were statistically excluded as the source with aprobability P < 0.01 for all individuals of our focal pop-ulations. This result suggests that we did not sample theexact source location of the studied introduced popula-tions. It is worth noting, however, that in the case of anextreme reduction of genetic variability (which is thecase in bottlenecked introduced W. auropunctata popula-tions), the GeneClass2 algorithm may fail to assign indi-viduals to their true source with a high probability dueto strong drift effect. In agreement with the FST andAMOVA results, the likelihood ratio scores provided byGeneClass2 for each introduced individual showed thatthe Guianese populations were however the most likelysources when compared to any other sampled nativepopulation (Brazil and Costa Rica).Overall, our genetic analyses suggest that (i) althoughstrong bottleneck events most likely substantiallyinflated genetic differentiation, it was unlikely that thesampled Guianese populations were the exact source(s)of the introduced populations tested for thermotoler-ance experiments, but that (ii) among available nativepopulations (Brazil, Costa Rica and Guiana), all testedTable 2.

Thermotolerance adaptation in the native rangeintroduced populations were genetically closer to the(also tested) Guianese populations. Therefore, althoughthe genetic relationships between the native and intro-duced populations were not fully resolved, the choiceof Guianese populations to represent the native rangeconstituted the best option available to test for anadaptive shift between W. auropunctata populationsfrom the native and introduced ranges. In addition, aprevious microsatellite study investigating the geneticrelationships between individuals from Guianese nativepopulations showed that sexual populations from natu-ral habitats were the recent source of the clonal popu-lations found in human-modified habitats (Foucaudet al. 2007). The present microsatellite data and statisti-cal treatments confirmed this close genetic relationshipand hence validate the phenotypic comparison of thesampled native populations to investigate a putativeadaptive shift within the native range of W. auropunc-tata.Thermotolerance assaysMortality rate was significantly higher for workers of popu-lations from natural habitats of the native range (NaN)than for workers of populations from human-modifiedhabitats of the native (NaH) or introduced ranges (IntH)[mortalityNaN = 0.79, IC95% = (0.60; 0.91); mortal-ityNaH = 0.29, IC95% = (0.16; 0.47); mortalityIntH = 0.21,IC95% = (0.09; 0.40); tNaN-NaH, 7.94 = 4.97, P = 0.0011and tNaN-IntH, 7.85 = 4.63, P = 0.0018; Fig. 2; Fig. S3 andS4]. In contrast, no significant difference was foundbetween the mortality rates of the workers of populationsfrom human-modified habitats of the native and intro-duced ranges (tNaH-IntH,7.85 = 0.95, P = 0.37).We also found a significant condition effect (Fig. 2;Table 2), meaning that our four sets of conditionsresulted in moderate to high mortality rates, as expectedon the basis of our preliminary results (summarized inFig. S1). The lack of interaction between the factors‘type of population’ and ‘condition’ indicates a constantrelationship between population type and mortality frommoderate to harsh abiotic conditions (Fig. 2). However,without a priori power computations, we cannot discarddefinitively that these interactions existed and were notsignificant because of a lack of power. The vertical posi-tion of the Petri dish within the climate chamber had asignificant effect on worker mortality rate (Table 2). Thiseffect was expected, given the pitfalls of current climatechamber technology (i.e., the occurrence of vertical gra-dients), and was controlled through the equilibration ofour experimental design (i.e., equal mixing of all popu-lations at each vertical position within the climate cham-ber). Importantly, no mortality occurred in the controlPetri dishes held at laboratory conditions (i.e., no differ-ence in mortality between populations at laboratoryconditions).Body size and thermotoleranceMaximum individual head width was normally distrib-uted (Shapiro–Wilk test: W = 0.989, P = 0.41) and indi-vidual variances were homogeneous for workers fromdifferent population types – that is, for workers fromnative natural, native human-modified, and introducedhuman-modified habitats (Brown-Forsythe Levene-typetest: P > 0.09). The linear mixed model analysis revealedthat the type of population factor was not significant(v² = 0.6287, P = 0.73; Fig. 3). Workers thus had similarbody sizes regardless of their habitat of origin (i.e.,native natural, native human-modified, and introducedhuman-modified).Furthermore, there was no linear relationship betweenmean values of thermotolerance and body size at thepopulation level (Fig. S5). After checking for thebinormality of the data, a Pearson’s product-momentFigure 2 Mortality rates of workers from three W. auropunctata popu-lation types for each experimental condition of the thermotoleranceassay.

Evolutionary Applications published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd 6 (2013) 721–734Thermotolerance adaptation in the native range Foucaud et al.correlation test indicated no significant correlationbetween mean thermotolerance and body size values(t = 0.9471, df = 4, P = 0.3972).DiscussionAdaptive shift between natural and human-modifiedhabitats within the native rangeOur thermotolerance study indicated that a major pheno-typic transition likely occurred within the native range ofW. auropunctata. Workers from native sexual populationssampled in natural habitats were less tolerant to hot anddry conditions than both native and introduced clonalpopulations sampled in human-modified habitats. In con-trast, populations established in human-modified habitatsin the native and introduced ranges displayed similar,higher levels of thermotolerance. The fact that native popu-lations from natural and human-modified habitats shareclose genetic relationships indicate that an adaptive shiftmost likely occurred within the native range of W. auro-punctata, before long-distance dispersal. On the otherhand, the less robust genetic relationships observedbetween the sampled native and introduced populationsmake it more difficult to unambiguously conclude that thehigh level of thermotolerance of introduced populationsderived from the prior adaptation of native Guianese pop-ulations in human-modified habitats.A previous study has shown that climatic conditions dif-fer considerably between adjacent natural and human-modified habitats in the native range of W. auropunctata,with the latter reaching higher temperatures and lowerhumidity (Orivel et al. 2009). Some of the abiotic condi-tions tested in our study correspond to the worst possibleconditions found in the field during an 18-month period,rather than to conditions likely to be experienced on a reg-ular basis by workers. However, the higher mortality ratesfor workers from native natural habitats populations in thetested abiotic conditions likely translate in a lower foragingefficiency and lower fitness in native human-modified habi-tats when compared to heat- tolerant populations. Consis-tent with this hypothesis, Cerda et al. (1998) have shownthat, in a Mediterranean ant community, heat-tolerant spe-cies have a higher foraging efficiency at high temperaturesthan heat-intolerant species.In invasive organisms, including insects, it has beenshown that wider thermotolerance abilities can stem eitherfrom local adaptation (e.g., in the snail Potamopyrgus anti-podarum, in the elongate hemlock scale Fiorinia externa;Dybdahl and Kane 2005; Preisser et al. 2008), or from phe-notypic plasticity (e.g., in invasive springtail species, in theMediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata; Chown et al.2007; Nyamukondiwa et al. 2010). Given our care to avoidacclimation as a possible alternative explanation (even ifmaternal effect has not been ruled out) through our com-mon-garden experiment, it is likely that the specific abiotictolerance of populations present in human-modified habi-tats arose as local adaptation within the native range and isnot the product of phenotypic plasticity. The relative extentof phenotypic plasticity of native and introduced popula-tions in thermal traits remains to be explored, however, asthis may contribute to the successful establishment of pop-ulations in dramatically different climatic areas (e.g., therecent invasion of W. auropunctata in Israel).These findings highlight the importance of selective pro-cesses due to human activities within the native range. Theswitch from heat-intolerant sexual populations confined tonatural moist and cool habitats to heat-tolerant clonal pop-ulations establishing in hot and dry human-modified habi-tats is probably a first step toward invasive success, as itallows the species to gain access to new resources and tonew transport opportunities, specific to human areas.These results are consistent with the ‘two-step’ scenario ofinvasion process put forward by Foucaud et al. (2010),which is largely based on the potential of native popula-tions to evolve under direct human pressure on landscapeproperties (see also Hufbauer et al. 2012). It is worth not-ing, however, that the current study does not strictlyFigure 3 Maximum head width of workers from the three populationtypes.

Evolutionary Applications published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd 6 (2013) 721–734 729Foucaud et al. Thermotolerance adaptation in the native rangedemonstrate the ‘two-step’ scenario in the case of the ther-motolerance adaptation of W. auropunctata populations.To definitively prove this ‘two-step’ scenario, one wouldadditionally require the demonstration of direct geneticrelationships between tested native and introduced popula-tions, which was not the case in the present study. Giventhe strong genetic structure found in native populations ata small geographic scale (Foucaud et al. 2009), a strictdemonstration of the two-step scenario for upper thermallimits may prove difficult using W. auropunctata as a modelspecies.The two-step scenario of prior adaptation in the nativerange before successful long- distance introduction hashowever been demonstrated in a recent study of the evolu-tion of cold tolerance in native and introduced populationsof W. auropunctata (Rey et al. 2012). This study showedthat the Israeli population, thriving in the colder Mediter-ranean climate, derived from cold-adapted native popula-tions of Argentina. Most importantly, studies of bothupper and lower thermal limits in W. auropunctata showeda similar pattern of local adaptation within the native rangebefore dispersal (Rey et al. 2012; this study). These resultscall for a wider appreciation of both native and introducedpopulation variation when investigating the evolution ofphenotypic traits during invasions. An important differencebetween studies of lower and upper thermotolerance in W.auropunctata lies in the nature of the associated selectionpressure. Indeed, the study of cold thermotolerance in W.auropunctata pointed to a naturally occurring local adapta-tion at the southern margin of the native range as instru-mental in explaining the establishment of the species in atemperate area (Rey et al. 2012). On the contrary, thisstudy of upper thermal abilities pointed to the role ofhuman selective pressures as the main instrumental factorof the evolution of locally adapted thermotolerant nativepopulations. While naturally occurring gradients are likelyto produce new adaptations that are predictable in geo-graphic and phenotypic spaces, adaptations to human-modified ecosystems appear much less predictable, becauseof more abrupt ecological variation and their network-likespatial organization over distribution ranges. To our view,these different types of selective pressure are thus notequally predictable and likely offer different challenges forthe management of invasive species.The hypothesis of human selective pressures modifyingspecies within their native range, driving them towardinvasive characteristics, is supported by a growing numberof studies on various species. For instance, the ant Tapino-ma sessile, native to America, is showing a striking transi-tion in social system between populations from naturalhabitats and populations from highly urbanized habitatswithin its own native range (Buczkowski 2010). The urbanpopulations also developed invasive characteristics withinthe native range, such as improved demography and eco-logical dominance. In this species, the role of human dis-turbance in the form of urbanization has been clearlydemonstrated (Buczkowski 2010; Menke et al. 2010).Unsurprisingly given the dispersal opportunities providedby human- dominated landscapes, it has recently beenfound to form an invasive population in Hawaii (Buczkow-ski and Krushelnycky 2012). Agricultural activities alsocause major changes in the biology of native species (e.g.,distribution, migration, dominance, demography), espe-cially with novel perturbation regimes or the introductionof new hosts (Via 1990). In the butterfly Euphydryas editha,a host plant shift occurred within 10 years following theintroduction by humans of two plant species, Plantagolanceolata and Collinsia torreyi, during logging and cattleranching in previous natural habitats (Singer et al. 1993).The reproductive output of E. editha has been shown to bemuch higher on its new hosts (Singer et al. 1993; Singerand Thomas 1996) and, if its potential for migration werenot so low (Brussard and Ehrlich 1970), it might have colo-nized vast areas in which its new hosts were introducedthrough agriculture (e.g., in California and Nevada). Insome cases, host-switching species evolve invasive features,thrive in their human-modified native range and eventuallyinvade remote areas. This was the case for the Coloradopotato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, which switchedfrom its historical Solanum hosts to Solanum tuberosumfollowing its introduction for farming. It subsequentlyinvaded North America, Europe, and Asia to become themost threatening pest of potato crops (Alyokhin et al.2008).In another widely studied invasive ant species, L. humile,a recent study has also underlined the significance of bothclimatic suitability and human disturbance as key determi-nants of invasion success (Roura-Pascual et al. 2011). It ishowever important to note that other factors such as thelevel of biotic interactions can still be relevant to explainsome local distribution in W. auropunctata (Le Bretonet al. 2007), as well as in L. humile (Roura-Pascual et al.2011).Effect of body size on thermotoleranceIn some ant species, differences in thermotolerance can beaccounted for by differences in worker body size (Kaspari1993; Clemencet et al. 2010). For instance, large Catagly-phis velox workers withstand temperatures 6–8°C higherthan those tolerated by smaller workers (Cerda and Retana1997). However, morphological measurements indicatedthat this was not the case in W. auropunctata, as workers ofboth heat-tolerant populations (i.e., established in human-modified habitats in both the native and the introducedrange) and heat-intolerant populations (i.e., established in730 © 2013 The Authors. Evolutionary Applications published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd 6 (2013) 721–734Thermotolerance adaptation in the native range Foucaud et al.natural habitats) had bodies of similar size. McGlynn(1999) and Mikheyev and Mueller (2007) found that work-ers from introduced populations were smaller than those ofnative populations, based on a wide geographic samplingrange. Additional Student’s t-tests on pairs of populationtypes revealed only a non- significant trend of this type inour own data set (results not shown). Most importantly,the goal of our morphological analysis was to assess thepossible relationship between body size and levels of ther-motolerance in population samples for which we had ther-motolerance data. In that respect, we found no significantassociation between these two variables. Thermotolerancein W. auropunctata is therefore probably achieved throughphysiological, biochemical, or behavioral processes, orthrough a combination of such processes, rather thanthrough an increase in body size. For example, in the smallworkers of thermophilic C. rosenhaueri, thermotoleranceresults partly from an increase in metabolic rate and adecrease in cuticular water loss, together with differences inbody posture (Cerda and Retana 2000).Physiological or other processes explaining the polymor-phism in thermotolerance remain to be investigated inW. auropunctata. In addition to other experimental investi-gations, direct approaches using functional loci could beenvisaged to study the genetic determinism of thermotoler-ance in W. auropunctata. Our thermotolerance assays couldthus be complemented with transcriptomic data, throughthe use of dedicated microarrays or investigation of theexpression patterns of candidate genes, such as genes fromthe heat-shock protein family (e.g. Dahlgaard et al. 1998;Fangue et al. 2006).Alternative adaptive scenariosOur microsatellite data set showed that the three testedintroduced populations were genetically closer to the nativepopulations investigated here for thermotolerance than toany other sampled native populations, but failed to proveclose genetic relationships between tested native and intro-duced populations. Some unsampled native populationsare thus probably the source(s) for the three introducedpopulations studied here. If such unsampled native sourcepopulations would not show any increased thermotoler-ance level, one would then favor a scenario in which adap-tation occurred in the introduced range, after long-distancedispersal. However, we advocate that the present knowl-edge of the biology of W. auropunctata renders this alterna-tive scenario far less parsimonious than the scenario ofprior adaptation in the native range, before long-distancedispersal.First, whatever the precise origin of the introduced pop-ulations, our results showed that a phenotypic shift in ther-motolerance occurred within the native range, most likelythrough a local adaptation process. The close genetic rela-tionship between the native populations from natural andhuman-modified habitats tested in this study is undisputed(Foucaud et al. 2007, 2009). As a consequence, we demon-strated here that, at least, prior adaptation can occur in thenative range of W. auropunctata. Any hypothetical scenarioinvolving adaptation after long-distance dispersal wouldhence also have to consider the simultaneous occurrence ofan adaptive shift within the native range, before long-dis-tance dispersal.Second, it is important to note that thermotoleranceis not the only phenotypic trait for which it has beendemonstrated that a shift occurred within the nativerange of W. auropunctata between natural versushuman-modified populations, and that native and intro-duced populations from human-modified habitats werephenotypically closer to each other than to natural pop-ulations from the native range. As a matter of fact, eco-logical dominance (Orivel et al. 2009) and reproductivesystem polymorphism (Foucaud et al. 2009) follow thesame pattern. Therefore, as more traits accumulate toreveal patterns of phenotypic shifts occurring in thenative range and later observed overall the introducedrange, it becomes more parsimonious to consider thatmultiple adaptations occurred at most a few timeswithin the native range prior to long-distance dispersalthan independently for multiple traits in multiple intro-duced populations after long-distance dispersal.ConclusionsThis study highlights the importance of human land usein bringing about major contemporary evolutionarychanges within the native range of species. Those adapta-tions to human habitats in the native range might consti-tute prior adaptations when introduced in remote humanhabitats, often showing little variability. This human-induced process may hence ultimately pave the way forthe emergence of new bioinvaders. Human modificationsof ecosystems are usually substantial, so most species mayfail to cross such large valleys in the adaptive landscape(see Lenormand 2002; Ravigne et al. 2009; Ronce andKirkpatrick 2001 for theoretical studies on this subject).However, W. auropunctata provides a striking example ofa species that eventually crossed such a valley within itsnative range, thereby gaining access to new resources andnew areas. This may not be an uncommon process, con-sidering that most of the worst cases of biological invasionare committed by human commensals (Ehrlich 1989;Lowe et al. 2000). More empirical studies within thenative and introduced ranges of invaders are needed todraw more general and firmer conclusions on the relativecontribution of prior adaptations (with a special emphasis© 2013 The Authors.

We propose a general model to explain how the sequence, duration and type of colonising society alter native species richness patterns through changes in evolutionary pressures. These changes cause different ‘filtering effects' on native species, while simultaneously altering the capacity of surviving species to adapt to further anthropogenic pressures. This framework may better explain the observed native species extinction rates and extirpation legacies following human colonisation events, as well as better predict future patterns of human impact on biodiversity",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/article, Journal articles","Human colonisation, Extinction / Extirpation, Native biodiversity, Evolutionary history, Sociocultural niche construction, [SDV.BA.ZV]Life Sciences [q-bio]/Animal biology/Vertebrate Zoology, [SDV.AEN]Life Sciences [q-bio]/Food and Nutrition, [SDV.BID.EVO]Life Sciences [q-bio]/Biodiversity/Populations and Evolution [q-bio.PE], [SDV.EE.ECO]Life Sciences [q-bio]/Ecology, environment/Ecosystems, [SDV.EE.IEO]Life Sciences [q-bio]/Ecology, environment/Symbiosis",,'Wiley'
Anthropogenically induced adaptation to invade hypothesis,528220345,Propagule pressure and an invasion syndrome determine invasion success in a plant community model,10.1002/ece3.8348,"Vedder, Daniel, Leidinger, Ludwig, Sarmento Cabral, Juliano",2021,"The success of species invasions depends on multiple factors, including propagule pressure, disturbance, productivity, and the traits of native and non-native species. While the importance of many of these determinants has already been investigated in relative isolation, they are rarely studied in combination. Here, we address this shortcoming by exploring the effect of the above-listed factors on the success of invasions using an individual-based mechanistic model. This approach enables us to explicitly control environmental factors (temperature as surrogate for productivity, disturbance, and propagule pressure) as well as to monitor whole-community trait distributions of environmental adaptation, mass, and dispersal abilities. We simulated introductions of plant individuals to an oceanic island to assess which factors and species traits contribute to invasion success. We found that the most influential factors were higher propagule pressure and a particular set of traits. This invasion trait syndrome was characterized by a relative similarity in functional traits of invasive to native species, while invasive species had on average higher environmental adaptation, higher body mass, and increased dispersal distances, that is, had greater competitive and dispersive abilities. Our results highlight the importance in management practice of reducing the import of alien species, especially those that display this trait syndrome and come from similar habitats as those being managed",,"article, doc-type:article",ddc:570,,
Anthropogenically induced adaptation to invade hypothesis,101860190,THE BIOLOGY OF POST-INVASION EVENTS,,"Scott P. Carrol L, Hugh Dingle A",2015,"In this contribution we consider the biology of invading organisms after they have become established. Adaptive radiation over the long term has been a favorite subject in evolutionary biology. Examples have been Darwin&apos;s finches in the Galapagos and the honeycreepers and Droscphila of Hawaii. Hawaiian honeycreepers have evolved from a finch-like ancestor into guilds of seed eaters, nectar feeders, and combined nectar and insect feeders plus some species with unique beak structures. In the Hawaiian Drosophila sexual selection may have driven the extensive adaptive radiation and speciation in the group. The North American soapberry bug Jadera haemotoloma is an interesting model for post-invasion evolution in the short term. Some populations have moved onto introduced goldenrain trees Koelreuteria spp. and have evolved different stylet (mouthpart) lengths, as a function o f fruit size, and new host prefer-ences, all within the last 50 years. These rapid responses are possible because of high additive genetic variances for these traits. Similarly, there has been rapid evolution of life history variation in American shad introduced from east coast to west coast rivers. We postulate that invaders most likely to integrate successfully are those in which high levels of additive genetic variation are expressed in traits most likely to be adaptive in the ne",,text,"adaptive radiation, genetic variation, trophic apparatus",,

biotic resistance hypothesis,86312089,Quantitative relationship between antibiotic exposure and the acquisition and transmission of resistance in bacteria in the laboratory,,"Händel, N.",2015,"The worldwide emergence and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria represent a major threat to human health care as the chance of therapy failure and costs for treatment increase. To curb the continuous rise of drug resistant bacteria worldwide, new strategies are urgently needed that counteract the development and spread of resistance. Development of innovative countermeasures depends on a deeper understanding of how sensitive and drug resistant bacteria respond to different drug levels, circumvent metabolic costs and the development of knowledge of the factors that can affect the acquisition of drug resistance. Therefore, the main object of this thesis was to characterize and quantify the relationship between antibiotic usage and development and transmission of resistance using laboratory cultures of E. coli as a model. The genetic and physiological changes that were shown in this study to accompany the acquisition of resistance indicate that bacteria are able to acquire resistance and compensate for metabolic costs due to various and highly flexible strategies. In addition, in vitro conjugation rates of a plasmid that confers antibiotic resistance and that originated from a food isolate was dependent on cell density, energy availability, growth rate and antibiotic concentration. The outcome of this thesis contributes to the current knowledge regarding the development and spread of resistance in bacteria and could be used as basis for further studies on molecular regulatory mechanisms involved in the acquisition of antibiotic resistance",,info:eu-repo/semantics/doctoralthesis,,,

However, past studies vary in their support for this hypothesis due to an apparent contradiction between experimental studies, which support biotic resistance, and observational studies, which find that native and non-native species richness are positively related at broad scales (small scale studies are more variable). Here, we present a novel analysis of the biotic resistance hypothesis using 24,456 observations of plant richness spanning four community types and seven ecoregions of the United States. Non-native plant occurrence was negatively related to native plant richness across all community types and ecoregions, although the strength of biotic resistance varied across different ecological, anthropogenic, and climatic contexts. Our results strongly support the biotic resistance hypothesis, thus reconciling differences between experimental and observational studies and providing evidence for the shared benefits between invasive species management and native biodiversity conservation.https://scholarworks.umass.edu/data/1109/thumbnail.jp",,text,"data, dataset, biotic resistance",,ScholarWorks@UMass Amherst

To manage this issue, we need to deeply understand the influencing factors and mechanisms. Based on the background of livestock husbandry, this paper reviews the factors that affect the acquisition of bacterial resistance. Meanwhile, the resistance mechanism is also discussed. “Survival of the fittest” is the result of genetic plasticity of bacterial pathogens, which brings about specific response, such as producing adaptive mutation, gaining genetic material or changing gene expression. To a large extent, bacterial populations acquire resistance genes directly caused by the selective pressure of antibiotics. However, mobile resistance genes may be co-selected by other existing substances (such as heavy metals and biocides) without direct selection pressure from antibiotics. This is because the same mobile genetic elements as antibiotic resistance genes can be co-located by the resistance determinants of some of these compounds. Furthermore, environmental factors are a source of resistance gene acquisition. Here, we describe some of the key measures that should be taken to mitigate the risk of antibiotic resistance. We call on the relevant governments or organizations around the world to formulate and improve the monitoring policies of antibiotic resistance, strengthen the supervision, strengthen the international cooperation and exchange, and curb the emergence and spread of drug-resistant strains",,article,"acquired resistance, antibiotic, heavy metal, biocide, resistance mechanism, mitigation measures, Veterinary medicine, SF600-1100",issn:2673-6225,'Frontiers Media SA'

Predictions about plant defense and resistance are often based on resource allocation trade‐offs with plant growth and reproduction. Additionally, two types of plant resistance, constitutive and induced resistance, are predicted to be evolutionary alternatives or redundant strategies. Given the variety of plant trait combinations and non‐mutually exclusive predictions, examining resistance strategies in related species with different combinations of growth and reproductive traits is important to tease apart roles of plant traits and evolutionary history on plant resistance.  Methods: Phylogenetic comparative methods were used to examine the potentially interacting influences of life history (annual/perennial), mating system (self‐compatible/self-incompatible), and species growth rates on constitutive resistance and inducibility (additional resistance following damage) across Physalis species (Solanaceae).  Results: Resistance was evolutionarily labile, and there was no correlation between constitutive resistance and inducibility. Annual species with fast growth rates displayed higher constitutive resistance, but growth rate did not affect constitutive resistance in perennials. In contrast, inducibility was negatively associated with species growth rate regardless of life history or mating system.  Conclusions: The different effects of plant life history and growth rate on constitutive resistance and inducibility indicate that defensive evolution is unconstrained by a trade‐off between resistance types. The interactions among plant life history, growth, and herbivore resistance show that plant defense is shaped not only by herbivore environment, but also by plant traits that reflect a plant's evolutionary history and local selective pressures",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/other, dataset",,,

Fortunately, it is possible to study some of the mechanisms of drug resistance, even at a biophysical or biochemical level, without necessarily knowing very much about how the drug works—just as it is possible to study (at least at a biological level) the question of how micro-organisms become resistant, without under-standing the biochemical basis of the resistance mechanism itself.

But how often does biotic resistance prevent the damaging monocultures that typify the most problematic plant invaders, and how often is biotic resistance overwhelmed by the direct and indirect impacts of human activities? This chapter attempts to answer these questions, drawing on the long history of research into biotic resistance. We first briefly describe the major forms of biotic resistance to exotic plant invasions as an antecedent to other, more detailed chapters on competition, herbivory and pathogens. We then describe a new neutral model where variance in disturbance promotes invasions over the short term, but over longer timescales only propagule pressure drives invasions. These findings are a cautionary tale; pending increases in global trade and travel, particularly to the tropics, may provide the prerequisite disturbance and propagule pressure needed to ultimately stoke further invasions. Finally, we highlight case studies where invasions have been mitigated by restoration of biotic resistance from native herbivores and competitors. These studies provide strong empirical support that conservation of native biodiversity can be a nature-based solution to some invasions, although it remains to be seen if climate change will alter these effects over longer timescales",,text,Biology,,e-Publications@Marquette
biotic resistance hypothesis,234340720,Data from: Mechanisms of biotic resistance across complex life cycles,10.5061/dryad.82j1g,"Rius, M.",2013,"1. Biotic resistance is the ability of communities to inhibit the establishment, spread or impact of novel species. However, the interactions that underlie biotic resistance depend heavily on the contexts in which species interact. Consequently, studies of biotic resistance that consider single processes, patches, species or life-history stages may provide an incomplete picture of the capacity for communities to resist invasion. 2. Many organisms have multiphasic life cycles, where individuals can occupy distinct niches at different stages of the life-history. Generally, studies of biotic resistance focus on interactions within a single life-history stage, and interactions at other life-history stages are overlooked. Here, we demonstrate that different mechanisms of biotic resistance occur across the life history and together limit the invasion success of an introduced marine invertebrate (Ciona intestinalis) in northern California. 3. We tested the role of interactions (competition and predation) with the resident community in limiting the abundance of Ciona through experiments conducted on fertilization, larval survival, settlement, early post-settlement survival, and the survival of juveniles and adults. 4. Under some circumstances, Ciona became abundant in mid-successional stages and showed more rapid growth rates than a morphologically similar native species, Ascidia ceratodes. However, predators reduced Ciona abundance much more than that of Ascidia at several life stages. 5. Furthermore, Ciona appeared to be a weaker competitor at the adult stage. Early life-history interactions with other sessile species at the fertilization, larval and recruit stages had modest to no effects on Ciona abundance. 6. The presence of biotic resistance mechanisms acting at multiple life stages, and potentially under different conditions, suggests that different components of biotic resistance interact to enhance the resident community's resistance to invasion",,Article,,,

biotic resistance hypothesis,484289743,The Structure of Fitness Landscapes in Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria : : Molecular Origins and Evolutionary Consequences,,"Deris, John Barrett",2013,"Antibiotic use is so ingrained in modern healthcare and agriculture that it can be difficult to imagine life in the pre-antibiotic era of the twentieth century. Many privileges we currently take for granted as rights, e.g., modern surgery, would not be possible without these drugs. But the rapid rise of antibiotic resistance may soon thrust the world back into this era. In order to predict (and ultimately prevent) the emergence of antibiotic resistance, it is crucial to establish quantitative, predictive links between the fitness of drug resistant organisms and the molecular mechanisms conferring resistance. Although the resistance mechanisms are often well characterized in vitro, their contributions to microbial fitness may depend critically on the environment and on the internal state of bacteria, which are often unknown in quantitative terms. To bridge this gap I investigate E. coli strains constitutively expressing resistance to translation-inhibiting antibiotics. The results show that in the presence of drugs, genes providing drug resistance are subject to an innate, positive feedback due to the global effect of drug- inhibited growth on gene expression. This feedback results in complex behaviors for isogenic populations of cells, including an abrupt drop in the growth rate of cultures at a threshold drug concentration. At drug concentrations below this threshold, cells exhibit growth bistability-- the coexistence of large populations of non-growing cells among otherwise identical, but growing, cells. This work demonstrates for the first time that many bacteria remain susceptible to an antibiotic even as they carry resistance to it. These behaviors do not appear in strains that lack drug resistance, and a quantitative characterization of drug-drug resistance interactions reveals a whole that is surprisingly richer than its parts. A mathematical model of bacterial growth based on the innate feedback predicts the onset of bistability and the growth rates of growing sub-populations, without invoking any ad hoc fitting parameters. Furthermore, the model describes a fitness landscape for bacterial drug resistance in different environments, allowing me to characterize the factors that determine the evolvability of resistance. The approach I use can be generalized to study resistance against other classes of antibiotics, besides the translation inhibitors studied her",,etd,"UCSD Dissertations, Academic Physics.

biotic resistance hypothesis,346573212,"The prevalence, mechanism and evolution of agrochemical resistance in natural populations",,"Parts, L",2019,"Agrochemical resistance is a growing problem endangering global food security. The cumulative increase in the number of resistant species since the introduction of the first synthetic pesticides in the 1940s and the projected increase of the global population place more stringent requirements on the yields of agricultural food production. An increased amount of damage is predicted to result from resistance to currently used agrochemicals due to the dearth of new chemicals being developed. Despite this, resistance biology lacks methods to study the phenomenon as a whole, beyond the identification of resistance conferring mutations in particular pest or lab populations.  This thesis tests the utility of using the model organism C. elegans to study the prevalence of naturally occurring resistance alleles, the dynamics of resistance emergence in controlled conditions, and the genetic basis of resistance from multiple sources. Assessing the presence of natural variation in chemical susceptibility utilising a genetically diverse panel of C. elegans indicated that resistance-conferring variation is widespread, as suggested by the identification of wild isolates naturally resistant to carbendazim and aldicarb. The observation of rapid adaptation to carbendazim exposure suggested a link between a high prevalence of natural resistance with fast emergence of resistance for benzimidazoles, while compounds of other modes of action, with high and low variation, saw no adaptation in experimental populations under the conditions tested. Identification of the genetic basis of carbendazim-resistance in strains of three different biological origins linked a C. elegans β-tubulin to the trait in all cases, indicating a high level of convergence and lack of stochasticity in the evolution of benzimidazole resistance. Furthermore, no fitness cost of benzimidazole resistance in the compound-free environment was identified under laboratory conditions, which is troubling as the presence of a fitness cost underlies many resistance management strategies.    Overall, the findings presented in this thesis provide evidence that C. elegans is a useful model system to study resistance biology in a holistic manner, particularly in an evolutionary context. An increased understanding of the natural prevalence, evolutionary biology and molecular basis of the phenomenon would better inform field strategies of resistance mitigation as well as computational models that study the interplay of complex parameters in emergence of resistance. Ultimately, this improved understanding could assist in minimising the danger of rapidly emerging resistant pest populations on global food security.</p",,Thesis,,,

Human resistance levels were most sensitive to parameters associated with the human compartment (rate of loss of resistance from humans) and with the environmental compartment (rate of loss of environmental resistance and rate of environment-to-human transmission). Increasing environmental transmission could lead to increased or reduced impact of curtailing antibiotic consumption in animals on resistance in humans.

R., van Kleunen, Mark, Dullinger, Stefan, Essl, Franz, Dullinger, Iwona",2018,"1. Biotic resistance represents an important natural barrier to potential invaders throughout the world, yet the underlying mechanisms that drive such resistance are still debated. In theory, native communities should repel both functionally similar invaders which compete for the same resources, and invaders which possess less competitive traits. However, environmental stress, trade-offs across vital rates and competition-induced plastic trait shifts may modify expected competitive outcomes, thereby influencing invasion dynamics.2. In order to test these theoretical links between trait distributions and biotic resistance, we performed a mesocosm experiment with 25 non-native ornamental species invading native plant communities. Each non-native species was grown with and without the native community under two watering treatments (regular and reduced). We measured biotic resistance as the difference in performance of nonnative individuals grown with and without the community in terms of their survival, growth and reproduction. We quantified overall functional dissimilarity between non-native ornamental individuals and native communities based on the combination of plant height, specific leaf area and seed mass. Then, assuming each of these traits is also potentially linked to competitive ability, we measured the position of non-natives on trait hierarchies. While height is positively correlated with competitive ability for light interception, conservative leaf and seed characteristics provide greater tolerance to competition for other resources. Finally, we quantified plastic trait shifts of non-native individuals induced by competition.3. Indeed, the native community repelled functionally similar individuals by lowering the invader’s survival rate. Simultaneously, shorter ornamental individuals with larger specific leaf areas were less tolerant to biotic resistance from the community across vital rates, although the effect of trait hierarchies often depended on watering conditions. Finally, non-natives responded to competition by shifting their traits. Most importantly, individuals with more competitive traits were able to overcome biotic resistance also through competition-induced plastic trait shifts.4. Synthesis. Our results highlight that both functional dissimilarity and trait hierarchies mediate biotic resistance to ornamental plant invaders. Nevertheless, environmental stress as well as opposing trends across vital rates are also influential. Furthermore, plastic trait shifts can reinforce potential invaders’ competitive superiority, determining a positive feedback.publishe",,info:eu-repo/semantics/article,"competition, Darwin’s naturalization hypothesis, drought, fitness differences, intraspecific trait variability, invasion ecology, mesocosm experiment, niche differences, stress, vital rates, info:eu-repo/classification/ddc/570",,'Wiley'

Bacteria evolve resistance to antibiotics by a multitude of mechanisms. A central, yet unsolved question is how resistance evolution affects cell growth at different drug levels. Here, we develop a fitness model that predicts growth rates of common resistance mutants from their effects on cell metabolism. The model maps metabolic effects of resistance mutations in drug-free environments and under drug challenge; the resulting fitness trade-off defines a Pareto surface of resistance evolution. We predict evolutionary trajectories of growth rates and resistance levels, which characterize Pareto resistance mutations emerging at different drug dosages. We also predict the prevalent resistance mechanism depending on drug and nutrient levels: low-dosage drug defence is mounted by regulation, evolution of distinct metabolic sectors sets in at successive threshold dosages. Evolutionary resistance mechanisms include membrane permeability changes and drug target mutations.

In this doctoral thesis I test hypotheses on biotic resistance using a large dataset of more than 1000 both failed and successful introductions of freshwater fish into Swedish lakes. We have found that the classic species richness hypothesis is a poor descriptor of introduction success because it fails to acknowledge that resident species contribute to the resistance in different ways. We developed a new measure of biotic resistance, the weighted species richness, which takes into account that the resident species contributes to the resistance with different strength and sign. Further, we correlated performance traits of species in their role as an invader and as a resident species to predict how the biotic resistance of these communities would develop over time. We found a positive correlation between performance traits: Some species have high introduction success, they make a large contribution to the resistance, and they cause extinctions when introduced but do not go extinct themselves when other species establishes, whereas other species are weak performers in these respects. Thus, the biotic resistance of these communities should grow stronger as non-native species accumulates. These results give us clues about what type of communities that should be most sensitive to further invasions, i.e., communities harboring species weak performers.  My results show that the biotic resistance of communities is an important factor in determining invasibility of a community.

Identifying and understanding ecological processes that contribute to invasion success are essential to predicting and remediating invader impacts in communities3,4. In particular, species diversity in recipient com-munities can drive ‘biotic resistance’ towards invasive species as a result of competition, predation, parasitism and other antagonisms, thus potentially limiting or preventing invasion success5,6. Predation is an especially pervasive force which can shape ecosystem structuring through both trait- and density-mediated interactions with prey7,8. However, the relationship between the invasibility of communities and levels of biotic resistance (e.g. predation) therein remain unclear, and the development and validation of methodologies to predict invasion success or failure are urgently required4. Indeed, the identification of universal species traits which reliably predict invader impact and success across taxonomic and trophic groups has thus far been largely unsuccessful9. In turn, this has acted as a hindrance to practical assessments of invasion risk and the associated development of measures to remediate invader impacts, and particularly for invasive species with no known invasion history3.Invasion science has been slow to integrate some key ecological concepts which are classically predictive in consumer-resource systems3. Traditionally, the functional response, defined as the relationship between resource availability and resource use, has been applied by ecologists to quantify interaction strengths between consumers and resources (e.g. predators and prey)10–12. Indeed, both functional response form and magnitude have been identified as robust measures of ecological impact from consumers towards resources, including from existing and emerging invasive species towards native resources4,9,13,14. In particular, the attack rate (search coefficient) and handling time parameters of functional response models align closely with the magnitude of ecological impacts across resource densities9. Furthermore, whilst three broad forms of functional response have generally been categorised (linear type I, saturating type II, sigmoidal type III), type II functional responses have been identified as particularly impactful towards target resources due to the destabilising pressures they impart on low densities of resources such as prey species13. In contrast, type III functional responses may enable population stability of resources due to low density refuge effects15.1Institute for Global Food Security, School of Biological Sciences, Queen’s University Belfast, Belfast, BT9 5DL, UK. 2Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, School of Biological Sciences, University of Reading, Harborne Building, Reading, RG6 6AS, UK. *email: rcuthbert03@qub.ac.ukopen2Scientific RepoRtS |         (2019) 9:15314  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-51705-9www.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/Classically, the consumer functional response has also been combined with the numerical response, which describes the consumer population response as resource densities change. In turn, this can quantify the over-all impact of consumers on resource populations, termed the total response or offtake rate10–12. Recently, the functional response approach in invasion science has been combined with proxies for the numerical response (e.g. abundance, fecundity) to develop population-level metrics which have been proven to correlate tightly with known ecological impacts (i.e. Relative Impact Potential3; Relative Invasion Risk16). However, whilst functional and numerical responses have been applied to examine the ecological impacts of invasive consumers (e.g. preda-tors) towards native resources (e.g. prey), there has been relatively little application of these approaches to quan-tify biotic resistance potential towards invasive resources (e.g. prey) in the context of invasion success6,17,18.Aside from functional and numerical responses, integrations of switching propensities between invasive and native resources have been neglected by invasion scientists4,19–21. This is despite the importance of consumer switching patterns for the persistence of species. Characteristically, if a consumer exhibits a switching propensity, disproportionately fewer rare resources are consumed whilst, simultaneously, disproportionately more abundant resources are consumed15. Importantly, switching (i.e. a form of frequency-dependent predation) may facili-tate coexistence between resources (e.g. prey) by imparting stability through low-density refugia concomitant with type III functional responses22. Therefore, in the context of invasion science, switching propensities by res-ident consumers have the capacity to directly influence biotic resistance towards invasive species and could thus be used in combination with functional and numerical responses of consumers in predictive approaches for invasion success. Indeed, if a resident consumer exhibits high magnitude per capita (functional response) and population-level (numerical response) effects, coupled with consumptive preferences towards invasive resources, offtake rates towards invaders will be high and it is thus theoretically less likely that the invader will succeed and subsequently have impacts on ecosystems. Although mechanistic interpretation must be cautioned in the absence of field experiments, comparative laboratory experiments may be used to rapidly quantify these effects (i.e. func-tional/numerical responses and preferences), and such studies have proven highly informative in the context of invader impact and success14,20.The present study develops a novel approach to quantify and compare levels of biotic resistance by resident consumers towards invasive species using the aforementioned concepts. We have three key objectives: (1) to quantify per capita effects among natural enemies towards separate invasive and native prey; (2) to examine ratio-dependent prey preferences of the natural enemies where invasive and native prey coexist, and; (3) to use population-level responses alongside per capita effects and prey preferences to quantify and compare levels of biotic resistance among agents. These results help to inform management responses for the biocontrol of target species by providing a novel means of comparing agent efficacies. Further, our results help to inform predictions of invasion success, given that high levels of biotic resistance towards invasive over native species may limit inva-sive species success likelihoods5,6.We use a well-documented field pattern, whereby an invasive mosquito species is a superior competitor com-pared to natives within the same trophic level, but is known to coexist, perhaps through differential biotic resist-ance from indigenous predators23–26. We develop our approach using a model invader/native system based on the invasive Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus and native common house mosquito Culex pipiens. Aedes albop-ictus is a highly invasive species that can vector pathogens that cause disease, and is known to outcompete native mosquitoes27–29. Yet, this invader has been documented to coexist with native species in aquatic habitats despite its superior competitive ability24. Whilst C. pipiens is also regarded as an invasive vector species in certain parts of the world30, in our study system (United Kingdom) it represents a widespread and abundant native species31, and is thus an appropriate candidate for invader-native comparative purposes. We quantify and compare biotic resistance towards these mosquito prey by three species of cyclopoid copepods. Predatory copepods are abundant and widespread crustaceans which are capable of thriving in most aquatic habitat types32. Given their tolerance to ephemeral environments via dormant life stages, and potential for both human-mediated and zoochorous dispersal between aquatic habitats33–36, there is high potential for copepod-mosquito overlap in various aquatic habitat types and thus predatory interactions. Furthermore, copepods are known to regulate mosquito popu-lations in aquatic systems36. Informed by empirical field-patterns, we hypothesise that: (1) copepod functional response magnitudes will be significantly greater towards invasive compared to native mosquito prey; (2) pred-ators will display a ratio-independent preference for invasive mosquito prey over native mosquitoes; (3) biotic resistance from native natural enemies will differ among predator species according to their per capita, selectivity and population-level effects.ResultsIn all experiments, 100% of control prey survived and thus experimental deaths were directly attributable to predation by copepods, which was also evidenced by partially consumed prey remaining post-experiment. In the functional response experiment, support for raw consumption models containing prey species, predator species and prey density received substantial support (Table S1a). Significantly greater numbers of invasive A. albopic-tus were consumed as compared to native C. pipiens overall (χ2 = 9.14, df = 1, p = 0.003; Fig. 1). Consumption differed significantly across predator species (χ2 = 16.11, df = 2, p < 0.001), owing to significantly greater con-sumption by M. fuscus than M. albidus (p < 0.001) and M. viridis (p = 0.02). However, consumption towards A. albopictus was higher for all predators given a statistically unclear ‘prey species × predator species’ interac-tion (χ2 = 4.19, df = 2, p = 0.12). Consumption was also significantly greater under increasing prey densities (χ2 = 73.66, df = 4, p < 0.001).All predatory copepods exhibited type II functional responses towards both C. pipiens and A. albopictus, owing to significantly negative first order linear coefficients (Fig. 1; Table 1). Attack rates tended to be higher towards A. albopictus than C. pipiens prey by M. albidus and M. viridis, whilst handling times were generally shorter for A. albopictus across all predator species (Table 1; Fig. 1). Maximum feeding rates were thus higher 3Scientific RepoRtS |         (2019) 9:15314  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-51705-9www.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/towards invasive A. albopictus prey than native C. pipiens for all three predators (Fig. 1; Table 1). Accordingly, in all instances, overall per capita predatory impacts as quantified by the functional response ratio (FRR) were considerably higher towards the invasive A. albopictus over the native C. pipiens (Table 1). Differential per capita predatory impacts between prey were, however, particularly pronounced for M. viridis (Table 1), and further evi-denced by a divergence in confidence intervals under higher prey densities (Fig. 1c), as compared to confidence interval convergence in M. albidus (Fig. 1a) and M. fuscus treatments (Fig. 1b).Raw consumption in the prey switching experiments was also substantially influenced by prey species, pred-ator species and proportional prey availability (Table S1b). Again, significantly greater numbers of invasive A. albopictus were consumed than native C. pipiens (χ2 = 17.14, df = 1, p < 0.001; Fig. 2). Consumption was signifi-cantly influenced by predator species (χ2 = 7.48, df = 2, p = 0.02), owing to significantly greater consumption by M. fuscus as compared to M. albidus (p = 0.04), and was greater where a particular prey species was present in higher proportions (χ2 = 70.08, df = 4, p < 0.001).Figure 1.

Instead, preferential selection towards the invader was exhibited across all proportional availabilities, as evidenced by recurrently high preference indices (ai > 0.5; Table 2). Preference index type (predicted/observed) and proportional availability were identified as important model components (Table S1c). Preference indices towards A. albopictus were significantly higher than expected under conditions of no preference (χ2 = 16.33, df = 1, p < 0.001). However, the strength of preference towards A. albopictus interacted with its proportional availability (χ2 = 17.10, df = 4, p = 0.002). Here, overall, preferences towards A. albopictus were particularly stronger than expected under higher proportional availabilities (0.5, 0.75, 0.9) (all p ≤ 0.01).Owing to greater relative FRR between invasive/native prey species, higher fecundity and strong preferences towards invasive A. albopictus prey, Relative Biotic Resistance (RBR) was greater by M. albidus as compared to M. fuscus (Table 3). However, in turn, RBR scores of both M. albidus and M. fuscus were lower than M. viridis. This was driven by particularly marked relative FRR of M. viridis towards A. albopictus prey, coupled with higher levels of fecundity in this copepod (Table 3; Fig. 3). Accordingly, M. viridis is expected to exert the greatest degree of biotic resistance towards the invasive prey.DiscussionInvasive alien species continue to spread, establish and reproduce in novel environments1, yet we have a distinct lack of methodologies to predict invasion success3,4. Biotic resistance may be a key mechanism which controls the success of invasive species. In the present study, we develop novel measures of biotic resistance driven by resident consumers towards invasive prey through the integration of functional responses, numerical response proxies and prey switching propensities. Our model species Aedes albopictus is a highly invasive vector mosquito, known to have superior competitive abilities for resources over analogous native mosquitoes, however often fails to displace these natives24,27,29,37. Culex pipiens is a native and widespread mosquito in our study region (United Kingdom), whilst A. albopictus has only recently been detected in the United Kingdom, following numerous successful invasions across Europe38. However, our results suggest that differential biotic resistance may limit the invasion success of this species, and cyclopoid copepods are known to be important mosquito predators35,36.

Copepods are particularly well-adapted to thrive in ephemeral aquatic habitats which these mosquitoes colonise, owing to their ability to enter dormant life history stages and spread via zoochorous dis-persal by vectors such as birds and insects, or by wind33,34,39,40. Whilst human-mediated copepod introductions into minute container-style habitats have been required for effective mosquito control at community-scales35, even in these instances, our results provide evidence for the efficacy of copepods in reducing target invader pop-ulations whilst alleviating native species from predatory impact. Nevertheless, mechanistic interpretation of our laboratory experimental results should be cautioned in the context of invasion success, with further field-based validation required that incorporates additional context-dependencies, such as emergent effects from interactions with other predator types and habitat complexities.In the present study, irrespective of copepod species, we consistently demonstrate higher magnitude per capita ecological impacts towards invasive A. albopictus prey as compared to analogous native C. pipiens prey using a comparative functional response approach. We subsequently demonstrate clear consumptive preferences towards invasive over native mosquito prey by all focal consumers regardless of proportional prey species availability, conducive with a lack of prey switching. Then, we integrate fecundity estimations as a proxy for the numerical response to quantify and compare the potential biotic resistance of resident consumers towards this invasive prey species. Whilst drawing parallels between laboratory-based studies and field observations should viewed with caution, our results align with field patterns of coexistence, wherein invasive Aedes mosquitoes have repeatedly been shown to coexist with native competitors, despite their clear competitive advantage23–25. We propose that the combination of functional and numerical responses, alongside examinations of prey switching propensities, may help to predict the occurrence of such field patterns in relation to biotic resistance and invasion success. Although we applied our metrics to a model copepod-mosquito predator-prey system, our approaches are equally applica-ble to other consumer-resource systems where an invasive species suffers from biotic resistance by resident con-sumers (e.g. predators). Thus, our metrics can, at least theoretically, be applied across multiple habitat types and taxonomic groups for predictions of invasion success and quantifications of biotic resistance. Yet, given numerous additional context-dependencies are known to alter levels of biotic resistance (e.g. habitat complexity6,18), these effects should be considered in future studies to better-reflect real systems.Macrocyclops albidus, M. fuscus and M. viridis exhibited type II functional responses towards both prey types, characterised by high rates of mosquito prey consumption at low densities. This finding aligns with copepod functional responses forms reported in other studies18. However, functional response attack rates tended to be considerably higher, and handling times lower, towards invasive A. albopictus as compared to native C. pipiens. Given attack rates correspond to impacts at low prey densities whilst handling times reciprocate asymptotic max-imum feeding rates, per capita predatory impacts towards A. albopictus remain higher than analogous native prey irrespective of prey density. The particularly high per capita impact of copepods towards A. albopictus also aligns with the documented ability of copepod biocontrol agents to be especially efficacious in the suppression of Aedes mosquitoes as compared to Culex36. Furthermore, our holistic derivations of per capita impact through coupling Figure 3. Triplot illustrating differential Biotic Resistance (BR) of Macrocyclops albidus (circle), Macrocyclops fuscus (triangle) and Megacyclops viridis (diamond) towards invasive Aedes albopictus prey. Estimations include relative functional response ratios (FRRs) between invasive and native prey, predator fecundities and invasive prey preferences. Increasing levels of BR are read from bottom left to top right, and raw BR scores are displayed in parentheses. Colours are ramped with increasing BR towards red colouration.7Scientific RepoRtS |         (2019) 9:15314  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-51705-9www.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/of attack rate and handling time into the functional response ratio (FRR: a/h) demonstrate greater predatory impacts by all focal copepods towards the invasive mosquito prey as compared to the native. This differential impact was particularly pronounced for M. viridis. The FRR metric has recently been developed for invasion scientists and practitioners and balances information from both key functional response parameters41. Invasive consumers have been shown to exhibit consistently higher FRRs as compared to native comparators across mul-tiple study systems and taxonomic groups41. In a similar vein, we suggest that the FRR metric can be applied in quantifications of biotic resistance across study systems, as it can negate contradictory impact predictions for natural enemies based on one functional response parameter over the other (i.e. attack rate, handling time).None of the copepod predators examined in the present study exhibited a prey switching propensity away from the invasive prey. That is, relative to proportional abundances, invasive A. albopictus were disproportion-ately selected over native C. pipiens across all availabilities. Prey switching facilitates patterns of coexistence in ecosystems through a form of frequency-dependent predation characterised by low density refuge effects4,15. If our laboratory-based results persist in the wild, it is likely that the sustained preferential selection towards A. albopictus would permit patterns of coexistence between these prey species even in light of the superior competitive capability of A. albopictus over analogous native mosquito species24,27–29,37,42,43. As such, this con-sumptive preference may offset competitive replacement of the native by the invader. Our results exemplify the potential power of our metrics for quantifications of biotic resistance which may mediate levels of invasion success, and future work should ground-truth these concepts across other invasive species study systems using field-based observations.Behavioural responses to predator cues are likely key drivers of such differential biotic resistance between invasive and native prey. In particular, naïveté to unfamiliar predators in novel ecosystems can influence inter-action strengths and further impede invasion success20,44. Invasive Aedes mosquitoes have been shown to be less responsive to predation risk and exhibit higher incidences of behaviours which make them more apparent and vulnerable to predators (e.g. thrashing, browsing)24,25. Indeed, whilst Culex mosquitoes are filter feeders which spend most time at the water surface, Aedes are browsers which spend more time thrashing below the surface45. Given these substantial behavioural differences, it is plausible that the predatory patterns exhibited by copepods in the present study extend to other aquatic predator groups, owing to potentially higher encounter rates with the more motile Aedes prey. Furthermore, Aedes mosquitoes have been shown to be attracted to predatory copepods when ovipositing, whilst Culex mosquitoes are evasive of these cues18,46. Such behavioural factors could be major drivers in limiting the success of invasive species via biotic resistance and, in our system, may help to regulate disease risk in the context of invasive vector mosquito species.The present study integrated estimates of fecundity as proxies for numerical responses of copepods47. The use of such proxies has proven robust in derivations of ecological impacts of invasive species and biocontrol agents3,48, and, here, high fecundity could facilitate rapid population-level responses to increases in resource availability fol-lowing natural enemy inoculation. However, importantly, the present study did not compare fecundities of pred-ators fed on the focal invasive/native prey, which may have altered estimates given differences in nutritional values between prey species. Nonetheless, whilst M. fuscus exhibited high magnitude functional responses towards inva-sive prey and strong selective tendencies, the fecundity of this copepod is substantially lower than both M. albidus and M. viridis47. Accordingly, in this study, our novel metric identified M. viridis as a particularly efficacious pred-ator towards invasive A. albopictus prey, owing to high per capita impacts towards the invader, strong selectivity traits and relatively marked fecundity. For management, our predictive metrics suggest augmentative releases of native copepods such as M. viridis for biocontrol could be especially efficacious in the suppression of invasive mosquito species, in light of favourable consumptive and reproductive traits.In conclusion, we propose that the integration of traditional ecological concepts that have been neglected by invasion scientists could enhance predictions of biotic resistance and help to inform invasion success. In turn, such predictions of biotic resistance directly inform management strategies for pests, vectors and invasive species via biocontrol. Biotic resistance from predators can be a key mechanism which controls invasion success, and these predator-prey interactions can be robustly quantified in controlled laboratory conditions. We show that the assimilation of functional responses, numerical response proxies and prey switching propensities enables more holistic derivations of potential biotic resistance towards invasive species at the population-level. Our results are consistent with empirical patterns, whereby the invasive mosquito A. albopictus is capable of outcompeting native mosquito species in a laboratory setting27,37, but has not been able to displace native mosquitoes in a similar fash-ion in the field24,49. Yet, further field-based studies are required to validate the predation patterns documented in the present study, and link them to invasion success. Nevertheless, we propose that biotic resistance is an impor-tant factor in regulating the invasion process, and can be quantified using metrics grounded in classical ecolog-ical concepts. For practitioners, use of these concepts could enable relatively rapid comparisons of biological control agents prior to release, by quantifying and comparing per capita agent effects and preferences alongside population-level responses. In turn, this could improve the efficiencies associated with natural enemy introduc-tions. Future research should also seek to ascertain the context-dependency of these approaches in predicting the success or failure of invasions across a multitude of study systems, alongside implications for the efficacy of biocontrol agents. Moreover, quantifications of predatory efficacies across a full spectrum of life history stages would provide a more holistic account of biotic resistance levels.Materials and MethodsAnimal collection and husbandry. Eggs of Aedes albopictus were obtained through the infraVec2 project and originated from Montpellier, France. Eggs of Culex pipiens complex mosquitoes were obtained from a colony maintained at Queen’s Marine Laboratory (QML), Portaferry, Northern Ireland, originating from The Pirbright Institute, Surrey, England48. Both mosquito species were maintained in a laboratory at QML, at 25 ± 2 °C and under a 16:8 light and dark photoperiod. The focal predators, Macrocyclops albidus, Macrocyclops fuscus and 8Scientific RepoRtS |         (2019) 9:15314  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-51705-9www.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/Megacyclops viridis were obtained from Glastry Clay Pit Ponds, Northern Ireland (54°29′18.5″N, 5°28′19.9″W) and cultured in the same laboratory (25 ± 2 °C,16:8 light and dark) on a diet of Paramecium caudatum and Chilomonas paramecium ad libitum until maturation.Experimental design. Adult female predatory M. albidus, M. fuscus and M. viridis (respective mean total lengths excluding caudal setae ± SD: 1.70 ± 0.09 mm; 1.81 ± 0.11 mm; 1.83 ± 0.17 mm) were selected for exper-iments and separately starved for 24 h prior to feeding. Recently hatched, size-matched first instar A. albopictus (mean ± SD: 1.40 ± 0.12 mm) and C. pipiens (mean ± SD: 1.32 ± 0.11 mm) larvae were used as prey. Copepods are known to be most efficient in consumption of early instar mosquito prey36. Experiments were undertaken in 20 mL arenas of 42 mm dia. containing dechlorinated tapwater from an aerated source during daylight. We employed a phenomenological experimental approach to compare biotic resistance towards mosquitoes factori-ally in a replicated laboratory design. Accordingly, our design does not seek to mechanistically replicate natural systems (see9). Indeed, mechanistic interpretation of such experiments must be approached with caution, or supported with further empirical parameter estimates50–52. Nevertheless, phenomenological designs, such as ours, are useful for comparative purposes in factorial experiments to examine differences in predator-prey interactions under controlled conditions53.For the functional response experiment, prey species were introduced separately at each of five densities into arenas (2, 4, 7, 10 or 15; n = 5 per experimental group). For the prey switching experiment, prey species were introduced in combination at each of five ratios (2:18, 5:15, 10:10, 15:5 or 18:2; n = 3 per experimental group). Experiments were conducted in a completely randomised array to eliminate positional effects. After addition, prey were allowed to settle for 2 h prior to the beginning of the experiments via predator introduction. Once individual copepod predators were introduced, they were allowed to feed for 6 h, after which the predators were removed and remaining live larval mosquito prey counted and identified to quantify numbers killed. Controls in each experiment consisted of a replicate of each prey treatment in the absence of predators.Statistical analyses. Data were analysed using R v 3.5.154. In the functional response experiment, raw num-bers of prey consumed were examined with respect to prey species, predator species and starting prey densi-ties in a factorial generalised linear model (GLM). All interaction terms were included in the initial model. A Poisson error distribution with log link was employed. We used second-order derivations of Akaike’s Information Criterion (AICc) and model averaging to identify the best-supported model using the ‘MuMIn’ package55,56. Here, all possible models were identified and ranked based on AICc (lower values indicate a better fit). Model com-parisons used ∆AICc, comprising the difference between the AICc of candidate models and the best-supported model. Akaike model weights (wi) were additionally used to probabilistically identify the best model, wherein predictor variables with good support yielded high cumulative wi values (near 1). Post-hoc Tukey tests were per-formed using ‘lsmeans’ where a factor yielded significance at the 95% confidence interval57.The ‘frair’ package was used to perform functional response analyses58. Logistic regression considering the proportion of prey consumed with respect to initial prey density was used to identify functional response types. Categorically, a type II functional response is inferred where a significantly negative first-order term results, whilst a significantly positive first order term followed by a significantly negative second-order term indicates a type III functional response59. To account for prey depletion over the experimental period, we fit Rogers’ random predator equation for the non-replacement of prey59,60:= − −N N a N h T(1 exp( ( ))) (1)e e0where Ne is the number of prey eaten, N0 is the initial density of prey, a is the attack rate, h is the handling time and T is the total experimental period. The random predator equation was fit for each predator and prey treatment group using maximum likelihood estimation, with the Lambert W function implemented to make the equation solvable61. Functional response models were non-parametrically bootstrapped 2000 times to generate 95% con-fidence intervals around starting estimations. Using the handling time (h) parameter, maximum feeding rate estimates (1/h) were additionally calculated.We subsequently applied a new overall measure of per capita impact towards both prey types for each pred-ator, by combining attack rates (a, functional response initial slope) and handling times (h, functional response asymptote) into the functional response ratio, which captures both parameters41:= a hFRR / (2)where FRR is the attack rate a divided by the handling time h. This solves the problem of which parameter to choose for comparisons, as a large a combined with a small h gives a large value (and hence quantifies a large per capita effect), while a low a and a high h gives a low value (and hence quantifies a low per capita effect). We denote FRRi as towards invasive A. albopictus and FRRn as towards native C. pipiens.In the prey switching experiment, numbers of prey consumed were analysed using generalised linear mixed models (GLMM) with Poisson error distribution and log link using the ‘lme4’ package62. Here, consumption was modelled with prey species, predator species and proportion available, alongside their interactions, as fixed effects, and with a random effects structure to account for repeated measures of prey types within each experi-mental replicate. Model averaging based on AICc was, again, implemented to select predictors which minimised information loss55, and post-hoc comparisons were performed using pairwise Tukey tests57.Manly’s selectivity index was then used to quantify preferences for invasive A. albopictus prey by each predator species across proportions available, with adjustments for non-replacement of prey63,64:9Scientific RepoRtS |         (2019) 9:15314  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-51705-9www.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/∑α = − −=n r n n r n(ln(( )/ ))/ (ln(( )/ )) (3)i i i i jmn n n0 0 1 0 0where ai is Manly’s selectivity index for invasive A. albopictus, ni0 is the number of the invader available at the start of the experiment, ri is the number of the invader consumed, m the number of prey types, nn0 the number of native C. pipiens available at the start of the experiment and rn is the number of native prey consumed. Resulting indices range from 0 to 1, wherein 0 indicates complete avoidance and 1 indicates complete preference. In our two-prey system, values of 0.5 are indicative of neutral selectivity by predators between prey types. Prior to formal analysis, we transformed resulting ai values to account for extreme data points (0, 1)65:αα = − + .n n( ( 1) 0 5)/ (4)t iwhere αt is the transformation and n is the sample size. Beta regression using the ‘betareg’ package was used to compare indices towards A. albopictus with those expected under null preference (0.5) with respect to predator species and prey proportion available66. Model averaging based on AICc was used in model selection as before, and post-hoc comparisons were undertaken using Tukey tests55,57.Combining the above results, we then quantified Biotic Resistance (BR) towards invasive prey using rela-tive FRRs between invasive A. albopictus and native C. pipiens prey (FRRi/FRRn; Eq. 2), reproductive effort as a numerical response proxy (clutch weight produced per female body weight per day47) and mean invasive prey preferences (Eq. 3) for each predator species:= × × aBR (FRR /FRR ) FE (5)i n iwhere the Biotic Resistance (BR) of a predator towards invasive prey is a product of the relative FRR between invasive and native prey (FRRi/FRRn), predator numerical response proxy reproductive effort (fecundity, FE) and the mean preference index towards the invasive prey (αi). We selected fecundity as a suitable numerical response proxy given its importance for the proliferation of natural enemies following changes in resource availability, and because reproductive effort estimates for the focal predator species were readily available in the literature. Relative Biotic Resistance (RBR) was then developed and used to compare among the three different predator species:=RBR BR1/BR2 (6)where BR1 and BR2 are Biotic Resistance for predator 1 and predator 2, respectively. Here, values of 1 indicate equivalence in biotic resistance between the two predators and values >1 indicate greater biotic resistance by predator 1 as compared to predator 2. Conversely, RBR values <1 indicate lesser biotic resistance by predator 1 compared to predator 2. We produced triplots to further illustrate differences16.We thus first quantified and compared functional responses by three native predators towards native and inva-sive prey when presented separately. Second, we examined prey preferences of the same predator species towards the two prey species when both are present simultaneously at different relative proportions. Thirdly, we used a predator numerical response proxy (fecundity), alongside functional responses and prey preferences, to predict which resident predator is likely to exert the greatest degree of biotic resistance towards the focal invasive species.Data availabilityUnderlying functional response and prey switching data are available in the online supporting information.Received: 13 March 2019; Accepted: 7 October 2019;Published: xx xx xxxxReferences 1.

The present review analyses this resistance, focusing on the networks that regulate its acquisition and its effect on bacterial physiology. It is widely accepted that antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes play fundamental ecological roles – as weapons and shields, respectively – in shaping the structures of microbial communities. Although this Darwinian view of the role of antibiotics is still valid, recent work indicates that antibiotics and resistance mechanisms may play other ecological roles and strongly influence bacterial physiology. The expression of antibiotic resistance determinants must therefore be tightly regulated and their activity forms part of global metabolic networks. In addition, certain bacterial modes of life can trigger transient phenotypic antibiotic resistance under some circumstances. Understanding resistance thus requires the analysis of the regulatory networks controlling bacterial evolvability, the physiological webs affected and the metabolic rewiring it incurs.Peer Reviewe",,artículo,, 0168-6445,'Wiley'
biotic resistance hypothesis,100589699,THE RESISTANCE OF BACTERIA TO ANTIBACTERIAL DRUGS: A SELECTIVE REVIEW,,"David H. Smith, David H. Smith",2014,"Bacteria may be resistant to antibacterial drugs because of some alterable property of the cell or the environment (&apos;phenotypic resistance&apos;) or some alteration of the usual genetic properties of the cell (&apos;genotypic resistance&apos;). Genotypic resistance can be mediated by a mutation of the bacterial chromo-some or the infection of the cell by an extrachromosomal element, e.g. an R factor. The properties of these resistances are summarized and those of the R factors of enteric bacilli are reviewed in detail. The resistance of certain bacteria to antibacterial drugs has been ap-preciated since these drugs were introduced into the medical armamentarium. The basis for bacterial drug resistances was not defined until somewhat later, however. Bacteria are now known to be drug resistant either because of some alterable property of the bacteria or the environment (&apos;phenotypic resistance&apos;) or a more permanent property mediated by a chromosomal or extra-chromosomal resistance gene (&apos;genotypic resistance&apos;). Certain aspects of each of these phenomena are summarized in this review but particular emphasis is given to the resistance mediated by the extrachromosomal resistance (R) factors of the enteric bacilli. GENETIC BASIS OF RESISTANCE Certain examples of alterable or &apos;phenotypic &apos; drug resistance of bacteria are presented in Table 1. All antibacterial drugs, with the exception of the polyrnyxins, inhibit only bacteria actively synthesizing macromolecules. For example, concentrations of streptomycin (Str) that are bactericidal for actively growing bacteria have no effect on the sanie cells if their protein synthesis is stopped by chloramphenicol (Cml) or the deprivation of a required nutrient1. Although the composition and quantity of the bacterial envelope is genetically regulated, these properties can be altered by manipulations of the environment, which, in turn, may alter the susceptibility of the cell to certai",,text,,,

This has led to situations where bacteria less susceptible or more resistant to microbicides have sometime been recovered from cases of human infections. There is now a better understanding of the mechanisms conferring bacterial resistance to microbicides and it is clear that bacteria have evolved and have the capability to withstand and survive exposure to high concentration of certain types of microbicides common in the healthcare industry in particular.

biotic resistance hypothesis,249389109,Cost of resistance: an unreasonably expensive concept,10.3897/rethinkingecology.3.31992,"Lenormand, Thomas, Harmand, Noémie, Gallet, Romain",2018,"International audienceThe concept of “cost of resistance” has been very important for decades, for fundamental reasons (theory of adaptation), with a wide range of applications for the genetics and genomics of resistance: resistance to antibiotics, insecticide, herbicide, fungicides; resistance to chemotherapy in cancer research; coevolution between all kinds of parasites and their hosts. This paper reviews this history, including latest developments, shows the interest of the idea but also challenges the usefulness and limits of this widely used concept, based on the most recent development of adaptation theory.  It explains how the concept can be flawed and how this can impede research efforts in the field of resistance at large, including all applied aspects. In particular, it would be clearer to simply measure the fitness effects of mutations across environments and to better distinguish those effects from ‘pleiotropic effects’ of those mutations. Overall, we show how to correct the concept, and how this correction helps to better understand the wealth of data that has accumulated in recent years. The main points are:  1. The concept of «cost of resistance» needs to be carefully used, to avoid misconceptions, false paradox and flawed applications. The recent developments in adaptation theory are useful to clarify this.  2. “Cost of resistance” and pleiotropy have to be distinguished. More than one trait is required to discuss pleiotropy. Resistance evolution must at least involve the modification of one trait. If there is an irreducible trade-off on that trait between environments with and without drug, it creates a fitness effect that is not due to pleiotropy. Pleiotropic effects can, but need not, occur in addition.  3. “Cost of resistance” must depend on the pair of environments considered with and without drug. Hence, there are as many measures of cost as there are environments without drug. If the focal genotype is not well adapted to one focal environment, it is relatively easy to observe “negative” costs of resistance. There is nothing surprising about this, and it does not indicate an absence of trade-off.  4. Environments with drug can differ according to the dose. It may be more informative to measure the possible trade-offs among all doses than to focus exclusively on the fitness contrast between the presence and the absence of drug",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/article, Journal articles","Pleiotropy, fitness, adaptation, drugs, parasites, evolution, genetics, environment, [SDE.BE]Environmental Sciences/Biodiversity and Ecology, [SDV.BID.EVO]Life Sciences [q-bio]/Biodiversity/Populations and Evolution [q-bio.PE], [SHS.HISPHILSO]Humanities and Social Sciences/History, Philosophy and Sociology of Sciences",,'Pensoft Publishers'

G., Ling, Maurice H. T.",2014,"Antibiotics resistance is a serious biomedical issue as formally susceptible organisms gain resistance under its selective pressure. There have been contradictory results regarding the prevalence of resistance following withdrawal and disuse of the specific antibiotics. Here, we use experimental evolution in “digital organisms” to examine the rate of gain and loss of resistance under the assumption that there is no fitness cost for maintaining resistance. Our results show that selective pressure is likely to result in maximum resistance with respect to the selective pressure. During deselection as a result of disuse of the specific antibiotics, a large initial loss and prolonged stabilization of resistance are observed, but resistance is not lost to the stage of preselection. This suggests that a pool of partial persists organisms persist long after withdrawal of selective pressure at a relatively constant proportion. Hence, contradictory results regarding the prevalence of resistance following withdrawal and disuse of the specific antibiotics may be a statistical variation about constant proportion. Our results also show that subsequent reintroduction of the same selective pressure results in rapid regain of maximal resistance. Thus, our simulation results suggest that complete elimination of specific antibiotics resistance is unlikely after the disuse of antibiotics once a resistant pool of microorganisms has been established.Published versio",,Journal Article,DRNTU::Science::Medicine::Biomedical engineering,BioMed Research International,

However, the concept of biotic resis-tance has since evolved and presently several mech-anisms are recognised through which resistance can beexerted (Levine et al. 2004; Kimbro et al. 2013). Theseare competition, herbivory, and predation (Pimm1989; Tilman 1999; Stachowicz et al. 2002), witheach shown to be context dependent and variableamong ecosystems (Dunstan and Johnson 2004; Riuset al. 2014). In terrestrial systems, competition-drivenresistance can be a significant force acting to limitinvasions by alien producers, with the strength of thisresistance increasing with increasing native producerdiversity (Levine et al. 2004). Overall, competition-driven resistance is most effective when resourcessuch as food and space are limited (Stachowicz andByrnes 2006). In contrast, resistance through her-bivory is thought to be most effective in freshwatersystems (Alofs and Jackson 2014). The generalistnature of many native freshwater herbivores has beensuggested to facilitate incorporation of novel invasiveplants into their diets (Alofs and Jackson 2014). Inmarine systems, the dominant mechanism throughwhich biotic resistance operates is predation (seereviews byWeiss 2011; Kimbro et al. 2013; Prior et al.2015; Papacostas et al. 2017).There are few documented cases where predator-driven biotic resistance has led to the completeelimination of an alien prey species (e.g. see de Riveraet al. 2005; Freudendahl et al. 2010; Dumont et al.2011). However, the recording of biotic resistanceeliminating a newly introduced species is expected tobe rare, as this would require knowledge of the arrivalof alien species before they have established. Thiscould bias the literature towards cases where predator-driven biotic resistance fails or only limits, but doesnot eliminate alien prey populations. However, whenconsidering cases where such resistance significantlyimpacts the success of alien prey, the importance ofthis regulating force is clear (Harding 2003). Forexample, the widespread invasive European shorecrabCarcinus maenas experiences effective resistancefrom a native crab predator Callinectes sapidus alongthe east coast of the USA. This has been attributed to apreference for C. maenas over native prey, coupledwith high consumption rates and large populations ofthe native predator (de Rivera et al. 2005). This casestudy highlights that when key factors align, predator-driven biotic resistance can be a dominant regulatingforce of alien prey populations.The effectiveness of predator-driven biotic resis-tance in marine systems has been suggested to beinfluenced by a variety of factors, including lifehistory and behavioural characteristics of nativepredators (Carlsson et al. 2009) and alien prey (Branchand Steffani 2004; Rius et al. 2014). However, thesefactors have most often been considered in isolation ofone another. For example, Twardochleb et al. (2012)suggest that biotic resistance will be effective whenthe feeding rates of native predators outstrip that ofalien prey reproduction but fail to address preypreference or the influence of alternative prey. Incontrast, numerous publications predict that prefer-ence for an alien prey over a native prey is key foreffective resistance (Carlsson et al. 2009; Ejdung et al.2009; Epelbaum et al. 2009; Shinen et al. 2009).Studies more focussed on alien prey predict thatspecies with high propagule pressure (Hollebone andHay 2007), r-selected life histories (Morton 1997) orpre-adaptations to the recipient region’s climaticconditions (Bomford et al. 2010) have high probabil-ities of invasion success, irrespective of native preda-tor abundance or behaviour.The varying outcomes of studies that predictsuccessful or unsuccessful biotic resistance suggestthat these factors cannot be considered separately butrather that all potential role players in an invasionscenario need to be accounted for. This study aimed toadvance a holistic understanding of factors governingthe success of predator-driven biotic resistance inmarine systems by applying a multivariate approach toassess which characteristics of alien prey and nativepredators moderate the outcomes of interactionsbetween trophic levels.MethodologyLiterature reviewUsing eight studies known to the authors, a keywordsearch was developed as a starting basis for a literaturesearch. Published literature investigating interactions123Aquat Ecolbetween alien prey and native predators was identifiedin March 2019. The final search strategy was appliedthrough online databases (Google Scholar, Web ofScience) using the following search terms: ‘‘bioticresistance’’ OR ‘‘invasion resistance’’, ‘‘marine’’ OR‘‘coastal’’ OR ‘‘ocean*’’ OR ‘‘sea’’ OR ‘‘*tidal’’,‘‘native’’ AND ‘‘predator*’’ OR ‘‘consumer*’’,‘‘alien’’ OR ‘‘exotic’’ OR ‘‘non-native’’ OR ‘‘nonna-tive’’ AND ‘‘prey’’, ‘‘regulat*’’ OR ‘‘exclu*’’,‘‘limit*’’ OR ‘‘restrict*’’. Studies obtained from thesesearches that met the following criteria were used foridentifying potentially important characteristics ofalien prey and native predators: (1) predators werenative to the study region; (2) information wasprovided on predator selection of alien prey, eitherthrough manipulative experiments or observationaldata; (3) information was available on predatorabundance in the study region; and (4) the authorsprovided conclusions addressing the potential forpredator-driven biotic resistance in the region ofstudy. To maximise the number of studies included,case studies were included when criteria 3 wasviolated but the required information could beextracted from other studies undertaken in the sameregion. Prey invasions across all stages of invasionwere considered, i.e. naturalised and invasive alienprey (sensu Robinson et al. 2016).From the identified literature, a list of characteris-tics of alien prey and native predators suggested to beof importance in determining the potential for preda-tor-driven biotic resistance was compiled. For alienprey that are likely to experience invasive success,these characteristics were: high reproductive output,high recruitment, high fecundity, rapid growth rate,high dispersal potential, inducible defences (i.e.plastic responses to different predators), high propag-ule pressure, gregarious behaviour and prey thatexperience refuge from predation. Characteristics ofnative predators thought to promote effective bioticresistance were: high abundance, high feeding rates,predators with generalist feeding tendencies andstrong selection of alien prey (which could be a resultof preference for alien over native prey, or of randomselection that nonetheless results in high consumptionrates of alien prey).Four biotic resistance outcomes were identifiedthrough the literature review (Table 1). These scenar-ios ranged from complete lack of resistance (Scenario1) to strong biotic resistance that resulted in successfulrange limitation or exclusion of alien prey (Scenario4).Information for all the 13 a priori alien prey andnative predator characteristics could not be found forall case studies, which resulted in the exclusion of fivecharacteristics (excluded prey characteristics: highreproductive output, rapid growth rate, inducibledefences, high propagule pressure; excluded predatorcharacteristics: generalist feeding tendencies). Thesecharacteristics had to be excluded to enable compar-isons among the case studies. Information for theremaining eight characteristics (Table 2) could befound for all case studies. Due to the multifacetednature of the data required for this study, informationon all the characteristics of interest could not beextracted from a single paper for each case study.Thus, information per case study reflects regionalknowledge frommultiple published works, precludingcase study level non-independence. It was not feasibleto set definitive cut-off limits for the characteristicslisted in Table 2. This was due to the wide variety ofbiota included in the review and because of inherentstudy-specific variation in measures such as recruit-ment, fecundity, abundance and feeding rates. Instead,the characteristics were categorised as per descriptionsby the authors of the case studies. This approach wasdeemed valid as the present study did not seek toquantify effect size of each characteristic (thusreducing the available pool of case studies too muchto draw generalised conclusions), but rather relied onthe knowledge of those who intimately know eachcase and system. This avoided the need to havenumerically comparable measures of characteristicsacross the case studies while enabling comparisons oftheir relative importance.Statistical analysesFor each case study, the presence (scored as 1) orabsence (scored as 0) of the characteristics listed inTable 2 was determined, resulting in a suite of alienprey and native predator characteristics present orabsent in each case study. Two statistical approacheswere employed to investigate the role of thesecharacteristics in determining the outcome of preda-tor-driven biotic resistance. Firstly, a PERMANOVAusing Bray–Curtis similarities was used to assessdifferences in the suites of characteristics among casestudies representing the four invasion scenarios123Aquat Ecol(Table 1). To account for potential taxonomic biasrelated to the identity of prey and predators in thevarious case studies, class of both predators and preywere included as random factors nested in the fourscenarios. In this context, this test was used todetermine whether the case studies assigned to eitherof the four outcome scenarios differ based on thepresence and absence of the various characteristics.A SIMPER analysis was then used to identify thecharacteristics that contributed the most to the simi-larity within each scenario and those that discrimi-nated among scenarios. All multivariate statistics wereconducted in PRIMER (version 6). Secondly, anordinal logistic regression model was used to inves-tigate the relationship between the characteristics ofnative predators and alien prey, and the four outcomescenarios. This analytical approach accounted for theordinal nature of the outcome scenarios and the binarynature of the characteristics. The best-fit model wasselected based on lowest AIC (Burnham and Anderson2002). These univariate analyses were conducted in R(version 3.6.1) using the MASS package. Modelassumptions were assessed using the nnet package.ResultsThe literature review yielded a total of 42 case studies(Supplementary Material). Some case studiesrecorded multiple biotic resistance outcomes (e.g.comparative studies of biotic resistance in varioushabitats), resulting in the following sample sizes(n) for each scenario: S1 = 15, S2 = 16, S3 = 7,S4 = 17. Notably, the case studies included a broadrange of taxa with native predators including jellyfish,urchins, snails, starfish, crabs, rock shrimp, lobsters,fish and sharks. Alien prey in turn included ascidians,bryozoans, hydrozoans, ctenophores, coral, mussels,clams, oysters, snails, crabs and fish. This emphasisesthe broad relevance of the results reported here.Table 1 The four proposed biotic resistance outcome scenarios as identified from case studies that examined interactions betweennative predators and alien preyScenario DescriptionS1 Main conclusionBiotic resistance has no impact on the alien prey population.Results of study that motivated scenario classificationZero alien prey were consumed by native predators. No statistically significant effects of predation on the alien prey wereobserved.S2 Main conclusionBiotic resistance has very little impact on alien prey populations.Results of study that motivated scenario classificationSome alien prey were consumed by native predators, but either (1) very little in comparison to the consumption of nativeprey, or (2) not enough to detect significant effects of predation on the alien prey population.S3 Main conclusionBiotic resistance has a demonstrable impact on the alien prey population, but not strong enough to result in rangelimitation or complete exclusion of alien prey. The alien prey population persists.Results of study that motivated scenario classificationLarge numbers of alien prey were consumed by native predators. Statistically significant effects of predation wereobserved in some pockets of habitat within the invasive range (e.g. a specific tidal zone, substrate type or depth).However, these effects were not equally strong throughout the entire habitat occupied by the alien prey and did thus notimpact the entire invasive population.S4 Main conclusionBiotic resistance is strong enough to result in range limitation/complete exclusion of the alien prey from the community.Results of study that motivated scenario classificationLarge numbers of alien prey were consumed. Statistically significant effects of predation on the entire alien populationwere observed and were described as being responsible for the range limitation/complete exclusion of the alien prey.123Aquat EcolCharacteristics related to alien prey were observedmost frequently in Scenarios 1 (total lack of resis-tance) and 2 (weak resistance), while native predatorcharacteristics were reported most often in Scenario 4(effective resistance) (Fig. 1).The suites of characteristics present in the fouroutcome scenarios differed significantly (PERMA-NOVA pseudo-F = 8.411, p = 0.01; Fig. 2), but didnot vary according to predator (pseudo-F = 0.340,p = 0.818) or prey identity (pseudo-F = 0.477,p = 0.758). Pairwise comparisons revealed significantTable 2 Important characteristics identified through a review of case studies that examined the interaction between alien prey andnative predatorsCharacteristic DescriptionAlien prey1. Gregarious behaviour A tendency to form groups or clumps. Such behaviour may be advantageous in terms of limitingaccessibility or increase handling difficulty by predators.2. High fecundity Fecundity that imparts a competitive advantage. When fecundity of an alien species has beendescribed as substantially higher than that of its native competitor, or when it allows for thesuccessful occupation of an unfilled niche in the invaded community.3. High recruitment High recruitment into the adult population. Notably, when recruitment exceeds that of nativecompetitors and is high enough to overwhelm predation effects.4. High dispersal potential Planktonic larvae with a long pelagic larval phase ([ 1 week) that can enable localisedestablishment and spread of at least 100–102 m (as per Simkanin et al. 2013); or prey with highmobility (e.g. fish).5. Predation refuge Toxic defences (e.g. organisms that produce toxic secondary metabolites); behavioural defences(e.g. autotomising body parts when attacked to enable escape); structural defences (e.g. shells toostrong for predators to break); rapid growth that allows prey to escape the ‘‘window ofvulnerability’’; isolation from predators through artificial structures (e.g. fouling communities onfloating docks)Native predators6. Strong predation pressure onalien preyWhen alien prey is preferred over native prey that results in strong predation pressure, or whenprey selection is random but nonetheless results in strong overall predation pressure on alienprey.7. High feeding rate Predator feeding rates reported as having regulating effects on prey populations which can be dueto (1) predators demonstrating a type-II functional response (Hassell 1978), i.e. highconsumption rates of prey when at low densities, and (2) predation by multiple predators thatcollectively yield high feeding rates.8.

High preyfecundity was most important in defining Scenario 1,while in Scenario 2 high levels of prey recruitment andhigh prey dispersal capabilities, coupled with highprey fecundity, were important. In contrast, Scenarios3 and 4 were defined by predator characteristics(Fig. 3). In Scenario 3 (i.e. strong but ineffectiveresistance), strong predation pressure on alien preywas the defining characteristic. Lastly, Scenario 4 (i.e.effective resistance) was defined by predator charac-teristics of which a high feeding rate and high predatorabundance were the most important. Notably, whileScenarios 1 and 2 differed from each other by 47%(Table 4), they were both more than 60% dissimilar toScenarios 3 and 4. Distinctions between Scenarios 2and 3 were driven primarily by the dominance ofnative predator characteristics in Scenario 3 (i.e.strong predation pressure, high feeding rates and highabundance), while the only prey characteristic that wasimportant in defining the differences between thesescenarios (i.e. refugia from predators) was dominant inScenario 2. In turn, Scenarios 3 and 4 differed fromeach other by just 26%, with high predator feedingrates being the primary characteristic responsible forthis difference and occurring more frequently inScenario 4. Notably, for all pairwise comparisonsbetween scenarios, predator characteristics werealways dominant in the scenario with greater preda-tor-driven biotic resistance.The best-fit ordinal regression model included onlythe predation pressure and abundance of nativepredators as predictors of the scenario outcome, withthese predator characteristics significantly affectingoutcome scenario (Likelihood ratio test p\ 0.0001 inboth cases). Notably, a case study was 81 times (CI14.6–447.8) more likely to be placed in a scenario ofmore effective predator-driven resistance if nativepredators exerted high predation pressure than if theydid not. Additionally, a case study was 32 times (CI5.7–182.0) more likely to reflect invasion resistance ifnative predators were abundant.DiscussionThere are numerous factors that can affect theoutcomes of predator–prey interactions (Ferrari et al.2011; Marraffini and Geller 2015). This is equally truefor novel interactions that occur between nativepredators and alien prey (Carlsson et al. 2009).Identification of factors that influence the outcomesof such interactions can provide an improved under-standing of predator-driven biotic resistance and whenit can be expected to operate effectively againstinvasions by alien prey. This study found that theoutcomes of marine predator-driven biotic resistancedepend on the characteristics of both alien prey andnative predators and that native predators are mostlikely to exclude alien prey when they (1) are abundant1S1S1S1S1S1S1S2S2S3S1S1S3S2S2S2S1S2S2S2S3S3S1S1S1S1S1S2S2S2S2S2S2S2S2S4S3S4S4S4S4S4S4S4S4S4S4S4S3S3S4S4S4S4S4SCase-studies1009080706050ytiralimiSS1 - Scenario 1S2 - Scenario 2S3 - Scenario 3S4 - Scenario 4Fig. 2 Cluster dendrogramof case studies assigned tothe four different bioticresistance outcomescenarios (Scenario 1—totallack of resistance; Scenario2—weak resistance;Scenario 3—strong butineffective resistance;Scenario 4—effectiveresistance)123Aquat EcolTable 3 SIMPER results of the relative contributions made by alien prey and native predator characteristics to the overall similarityof four biotic resistance outcome scenariosScenario Characteristic Trophic group %Contribution%CumulativeScenario 1 (averagesimilarity = 76.96)High fecundity Alien prey 27.04 27.04High recruitment Alien prey 23.50 50.54Gregarious behaviour Alien prey 23.13 73.67Predation refuge Alien prey 17.16 90.84Scenario 2 (averagesimilarity = 81.92)High fecundity Alien prey 21.71 21.71High recruitment Alien prey 21.71 43.43High dispersal potential Alien prey 21.71 65.14Gregarious behaviour Alien prey 15.84 80.98High abundance Nativepredator9.16 90.14Scenario 3 (averagesimilarity = 76.81)Strong predation pressure on alien prey Nativepredator22.01 22.01High abundance Nativepredator16.17 38.18Gregarious behaviour Alien prey 15.28 53.45High fecundity Alien prey 14.77 68.22High dispersal potential Alien prey 14.77 82.99High recruitment Alien prey 10.14 93.13Scenario 4 (averagesimilarity = 81.98)High feeding rate Nativepredator22.07 22.07High abundance Nativepredator22.07 44.14Strong predation pressure on alien prey Nativepredator19.35 63.50High fecundity Alien prey 14.01 77.51Gregarious behaviour Alien prey 8.26 85.77High dispersal potential Alien prey 7.59 93.36HighfecundityHighrecruitmentHigh dispersalpotentialGregariousbehaviourHighabundanceStrong predationpressure on alienpreyHigh feedingrateS3S1 S2 S4Alien prey Native predatorsFig. 3 Alien prey (solid black line) and native predator (dottedblack line) characteristics that contributed at least 65% to theoverall similarity within each biotic resistance scenario (S1—total lack of resistance; S2—weak resistance; S3—strong butineffective resistance; S4—effective resistance; see Table 1 forfull descriptions).

Incontrast, high fecundity, recruitment and dispersalpotential of alien prey in combination with the absenceof either strong predation pressure, high predatorabundance and/or high feeding rates by native preda-tors were found to likely result in biotic resistancefailure.The lack of a significant difference betweenScenario 3 (strong but ineffective resistance) andScenario 4 (effective resistance) in the multivariateanalyses may be explained by a current bias inpublished information. This is reflected in the factthat Scenario 3 outcomes were documented in onlyseven studies, with other Scenarios being representedby more than double that number of studies. Thus, theability to separate Scenario 3 from Scenario 4 mayimprove as more studies document this outcome.However, in Scenario 3, the two characteristics thatcontributed the most to overall similarity were those ofnative predators (strong predation pressure, highabundance), the same characteristics that were iden-tified as important for invasion resistance by theordinal regression model. Even though the individualcontributions of alien prey characteristics were lowerthan those of native predators’, they should perhapsnot be disregarded as they collectively contributed to54.96% similarity among the Scenario 3 case studies.These prey characteristics (gregarious behaviour, highfecundity, high dispersal potential) may in fact explainwhy resistance in these scenarios fail. Prey withr-selected life-history strategies (e.g. high fecundity,rapid growth, fast reproductive rates) are thought to bemore likely to be successful invaders in comparison tothose with K-selected traits (e.g. slow growth, lowfecundity and reduced reproductive rates) (Troost2010), an idea exemplified in Scenarios 1 and 2.Gregarious behaviour, in turn, is a characteristic that islinked to reduced individual predation risk (Pitcherand Parrish 1993) and has been shown to reducepredation by invasive lionfish (Pterois volitans, P.miles) on schooling fish (D’Agostino et al. 2000;Green and Côté 2014). Notably, even sessile taxa likemussels demonstrate increased clumping (aggrega-tion) behaviour in response to predator cues (Côté andJelnikar 1999).There are several aspects that may affect predator–prey dynamics that could not be accounted for in thisTable 4 SIMPER results of the relative contributions made byalien prey and native predator characteristics to the dissimi-larity between the various biotic resistance outcome scenarios.The dominant scenario refers to the scenario within thepairwise comparison in which that characteristic occurred mostoftenComparison Characteristic TrophicgroupDominantscenario%Contribution%CumulativeScenario 1 versus scenario 2 (averagedissimilarity = 47.10)High dispersal potential Alien prey S2 37.44 37.44Predation refuge Alien prey S1 27.89 65.33High abundance NativepredatorS2 25.35 90.68Scenario 2 versus Scenario 3 (averagedissimilarity = 61.35)Strong predation pressureon alien preyNativepredatorS3 36.58 36.58High feeding rate NativepredatorS3 26.32 63.13Predation refuge Alien prey S2 15.11 78.27High abundance NativepredatorS3 12.63 90.90Scenario 3 versus Scenario 4 (averagedissimilarity = 26.08)High feeding rate NativepredatorS4 28.84 28.84High recruitment Alien prey S3 17.58 46.69High dispersal potential Alien prey S3 17.28 63.97Gregarious behaviour Alien prey S3 16.46 80.43High fecundity Alien prey S3 10.90 91.33123Aquat Ecolstudy. Propagule pressure [i.e. the number andfrequency of alien individuals released into a regionto which they are not native (Lockwood et al. 2005)] isone such factor, although substantial propagule pres-sure has been shown capable of overcoming predator-driven biotic resistance in marine systems (Holleboneand Hay 2007; Clark and Johnston 2009). Unfortu-nately, this aspect of invasions can be difficult toquantify in the marine environment (Simkanin et al.2017), resulting in an overall paucity of informationregarding propagule pressure of marine alien species.As such, propagule pressure could not be incorporatedinto this study, although the influence thereof shouldnot be disregarded. There are also factors that can alterthe foraging behaviour of native predators, such asadaptation towards novel alien prey and non-con-sumptive effects (NCEs) (Diller et al. 2014; Yorisueet al. 2019). Although these aspects of predator–preyinteractions are important, a paucity of publishedresearch in the specific topic of native predator–alienprey interactions and marine biotic resistance pre-vented their inclusion in this study.Themajority of previous research conducted on thistopic considered single aspects of native predators andalien prey behaviour and demographics. While thisinformation remains valuable, it is suggested thatgreater insight into the context dependency associatedwith the outcomes of biotic interactions could begained by accounting for the characteristics of all thebiota involved. Within the milieu of predator-drivenbiotic resistance, it is clear that the nature of both localpredators and alien prey is important in determiningwhether biotic resistance will manifest or not. The factthat abundant native predators with high feeding ratesare characteristic of successful predator-driven bioticresistance highlights the need to conserve fullyfunctioning marine systems. Reduced or depletedpredator populations as a result of pressures such asover-harvesting may leave these ecosystems morevulnerable to invasions by alien prey.Acknowledgements The DSI-NRF Centre of Excellence forInvasion Biology is gratefully acknowledged for funding thatsupported this research.

biotic resistance hypothesis,154306607,Theoretical studies of bacterial evolution and the control of antibiotic resistance,,"Wu, Yue, Biotechnology & Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW",2015,"Antibiotic resistance, one of the most pressing challenges facing public health today, arises when a drug-sensitive bacterial population evolves and becomes resistant to antibiotic treatment.  The aim of this thesis is to understand the evolution of bacterial genomes and its implications for the antibiotic resistance problem.  We develop four sets of mathematical models to pursue our research across multiple levels.  The first model investigates within-host population dynamics by specifying bacterial growth rates as functions of both genetic and environmental states.  The findings identify essential conditions favouring the rise of resistance, in particular, resistant-compensated mutants that remove costs of resistance.  The form of environmental change and fitness trade-offs between different genotypes are critical in resistance evolution; this raises a concern about exposure to sub-lethal antibiotic concentrations for prolonged periods of time.  Moving from individual- to population-level, the second model focuses on the public health problem of resistant-compensated strains at the epidemiological level.  We ask whether a drug-resistant population could revert to sensitivity, and model how the application of a susceptibility testing followed by an alternative second-line therapy might help control resistance and even lead to disease eradication.  We find that disease eradication is possible if testing and second-line treatment are conducted at high enough rates before resistance to the second drug arises.  The third model compares effects of two types of interventions for reducing antibiotic overuse: improvement on bacterial infection diagnosis, and health education that changes patient behaviour from a relatively higher to lower rate of antibiotic use.  Our results show that better diagnosis can sometimes control resistance more efficiently than the educational intervention.  Optimisation of existing interventional strategies should give attention to the prevalence of bacterial infections among patients and behavioural patterns of antibiotic use.  Given the importance of mobile DNA in bacterial evolution and the spread of antibiotic resistance genes, in the fourth model, we study dynamics of insertion sequences in a clonal population by simulating transposition activities and their resulting fitness impacts on genomes.  This improves our understanding of the role of transposition bursts in maintaining mobile genetic elements",,"Thesis, PhD Doctorate","Infectious disease, Bacterial evolution, Antimicrobial resistance, Mathematical modelling, Epidemiology",,University of New South Wales.

Defense of plants against pathogen infections are broadly based on diverse strategies. Plants possess a range of constitutive or inducible resistance mechanisms to defend themselves against the particular pathogenic attack. For this, plants may have evolved mechanisms to perceive pathogen attacks and to translate that perception into an adaptive response. In contrast to animals which possess specia-lized cells for defense, each individual plant cell possess *Corresponding author. E-mail:  kapildeos@hotmail.com. Tel: +915270262123.

Res.    a preformed inducible defense capability for their pro-tection. Host resistance is shown by a particular cultivar within a plant species that as a whole is normally sus-ceptible to the pathogen. On the other hand, nonhost resistance is expressed by all members of a plant species to a particular pathogen. However, even susceptible plants are capable of reacting in a way that may slow down growth of the pathogen. The presence of such basal resistance was evidenced in Arabidopsis by the isolation of enhanced disease susceptibility mutants (Heath, 2000). Extensive studies on gene for gene resis-tance have made it possible to clone > 40 Resistance (R) genes from plants (Martin et al., 2003). Such single domi-nant R genes can be transferred within closely related species to protect the more agronomically useful crop plants. Resistance conferred by single dominant R gene is specific to a particular pathogen race that can express the corresponding avirulance gene(s). Pathogen aviru-lance genes can be easily mutated or eliminated, and hence protection conferred by R genes is not durable. Drawing a discrete line between host and nonhost status is not always straight forward, since some plant and pathogen that is species combinations suggest marginal host or near-nonhost status, when only few accessions of a plant species are at most moderately susceptible to a heterologous pathogen (Niks, 1987). It is generally con-cluded that the majority of plants are immune to the majority of microbes with pathogenic potential against the pathogen those can infect two plant species in a habitat (Yun et al., 2003). Nonhost resistance (NHR) is displayed at the species level that is all cultivars of a plant are resistant to infection by all genotypes within a pathogen species. Though nonhost resistance still remains poorly understood, but some important progress has been made in the recent year. Studies on the genetics of plant NHR identified critical components mediating cross-species resistance (Heath, 2002).  Due to the durable immunity, the molecular mechanism of nonhost resistance in plants outside the host range of a particular pathogen has attracted much attention earlier, which exerts broad-spectrum activity against the different disease causing species. NHR, however, has proved difficult to characterize as a result of the absence of a tractable genetic system. It is thought to be genetically complex, involving the deployment of both constitutive and inducible defense responses, in combination with a host physiology that may be routinely incompatible with pathogenesis. The present review is focused on recent advances of nonhost resistance, its mechanism and components involved in nonhost resistance towards plant systems.   BASIS OF HOST AND NONHOST RESISTANCE  Broad spectrum of host and non-host resistance  Resistance to different diseases of plants has historically been  classified  into two major categories, (i) host and (ii)      nonhost resistance. Host resistance to plant pathogen has been more thoroughly investigated, unlike non-host resistance, because it is genetically accessible (Gilbert and Webb, 2007). This general case is termed as host resistance, specific resistance, genotypic resistance, or cultivar resistance. Such resistance occurs when genetic polymorphism for susceptibility is observed in the same plant taxon, i.e., some genotypes show heritable resis-tance to a particular pathogen whereas other genotypes in the same gene pool are susceptible. In resistant indivi-duals, the pathogen may or may not multiply to some extent, but spread of the pathogen through the plant is demonstrably restricted relative to susceptible hosts, and disease symptoms generally are either highly localized or are not evident. Host resistance, however, is usually restricted to a particular pathogen species and is com-monly expressed against specific pathogen genotypes. In this case, plant specifically recognizes the invading pathogen and active defense responses are induced that lead to resistance. Elicitation of defense responses is mediated by the perception of pathogen signal molecules encoded by avirulence (Avr) genes only when the mat-ching plant resistance (R) gene is present, which results in an incompatible interaction between resistant host and avirulent pathogen. If the R and/or Avr gene is absent or nonfunctional, the interaction between host (susceptible) and pathogen (virulent) is compatible. As opposed to the basal defense responses that often partially inhibit pathogens during colonization of the host plants, R-gene-mediated resistance involves a rapid and effective defense (Figure 1). Plant defends itself, as resistant (immune) reaction when it comes in contact with a pathogenic agent to which the plant is not a host (Figure 1). This is known as nonhost resistance and is the most common form of resistance (or defense from attack) in nature and unsuccessful plant/pathogen interactions re-present nonhost resistance (Fraser, 1990). In nonhost resistance, all genotypes within a plant species show resistance or fail to be infected by a particular pathogen, specifically signifies the state where genetic polymor-phism for susceptibility to a particular pathogen has not been identified in a host taxon. Although underlying mec-hanisms of nonhost resistance to pathogens are largely unknown and are likely as diverse for pathogen as they are for other classes of plant pathogens (Agrios, 1997). For example, mango tree will not be infected when the pathogens of tomato, of wheat, or of citrus trees come in contact to the above said plants, because the genetic makeup of mango tree is different to that of the host plant (tomato, wheat or citrus); are incompatible to each other and under that case due to that genetic constitution and needs specific reaction site for induction of disease/ specificity. Similarly, the fungus that causes Fusarium wilt on pigeon pea (Fusarium udum), does not infect pigeon pea, and so on unless it posses specificity for susceptible host. Understanding the ways by which infection fails to nonhost plants may be particularly important for break throughs in the development of plants with durable broad-Shamim et al.          4737      Figure 1. Interaction and disease development phenomenon in plant by host resistance and nonhost resistance     spectrum disease resistance.   CLASSES OF NONHOST RESISTANCE  The type of nonhost resistance depend how plants triggered in a resistance response and this depends on both the plants and pathogen species. Based on the observations recorded earlier, nonhost resistance against bacteria, fungi and oomycetes was classified into two types: type I and type II, however, it is still not clear that non-host resistance against viruses can be classified in the same manner (Mysore and Ryu, 2004) or a new classification have to be evolved for viruses. It is also reported that different plant species may show different resistance response by a single pathogen as both non-host resistances type I and type II. This may be due to the fact that type I and type II are mainly resisted by the passive mechanism when essential host components are missing in the pathogen (Holub and Cooper, 2004). Tobacco and Arabidopsis mutant analysis also revealed that some of the signal transduction pathways of type II NHR might converge with host resistance pathways (Yun et al., 2003). Type I nonhost (non HR mediated) resistance  Type I nonhost resistance is the most common type of non host resistance in plant system till date and this type of resistance does not produce any visible symptoms (necrosis or surface injury) on the infected plants. The pathogen will not be able to get pass the first or the second obstacle of the plant cell, and finally the multipli-cation and penetration of the pathogen into the plant in type I nonhost resistance will be completely arrested at the site of pathogen invasion. Though in this reaction the plant looks normal from their outer surface (without any visible symptoms), but inside the plant cell, several molecular changes might be happening. In some cases, nonhost resistance is not associated with induction of a hyper sensitive response, such that a nonhost plant species can show type I nonhost resistance against one pathogen species and type II resistance against another pathogen species. For example, Nicotiana benthamiana exhibits type I nonhost resistance against Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris and type II nonhost resistance against Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. For example, P. syringae pv. phaseolicola triggers type I  nonhost resistance in Arabidopsis and type II nonhost resistance4738          Afr. J. Microbiol. Res.      Figure 2. A. Resistance mechanism of the nonhost I, B. Resistance mechanism of the nonhost II to resist the pathogen.    in tobacco (Dawson and Hilf, 1992). In Figure 2A, the general model for the mechanism of type I (non-HR-mediated) nonhost resistance is given.   Type II nonhost (HR mediated) resistance  Type II nonhost resistance is a more sophisticated plant defense mechanism than type I nonhost resistance and phenotypically similar like as an incompatible gene-for-gene interaction. Unlike to type I nonhost resistance, type II nonhost resistance is always associated with rapid localized necrosis (HR). An elicitor(s) will be recognized by the plant surveillance system and a defense reaction leading to HR will be activated. This will prevent the further spread of the pathogen from the infected cell (Figure 2B). Similarities were reported between nonhost as well as in gene for gene resistance responses but it is still not clear what mechanisms are involved in producing these resistance responses. It has been reported that some pathogens can conquer early obstacles by produ-cing detoxifying enzymes to overcome the toxic effect of preformed antimicrobial plant secondary metabolites (Lu et al., 2004). In the second phase of the plants, when it faces the pathogen, then the plant internal cellular sys-tem goes to defense surveillance. After that the plants have evolved to recognize certain pathogen elicitors, either in the plant cytoplasm or at the plant cell membrane, a defense mechanism is triggered to hyper sensitive res-ponse. Such type of pathogen elicitors can be recognized by plants to activate defense responses known as avirulence (Avr) proteins. Avr proteins when not recognized     by plants can enhance the virulence of pathogens (Osbourn, 1996). Once a pathogen can overcome prefor-med and general elicitor induced barriers, fungal and oomycete pathogens can directly penetrate a plant cell whereas most plant bacterial pathogens inject virulence and avirulence proteins into the plant cell through a hrp gene-encoded type III secretion system (TTSS). For fun-gal and oomycete pathogens, the extracellular proteins on the hyphae or secreted proteins serve as elicitors whereas the injected avirulence proteins serve as elici-tors for bacterial pathogens (Shan et al., 2004).   MECHANISM OF RESISTANCE AND EXAMPLE OF NONHOST RESISTANCE  Mechanism and examples of nonhost resistance  In general, a pathogen lands on a nonhost plant, then it tries to enter the host tissue in search of nutrition for its biological activity. After landing, the pathogen will face plant barriers (known as passive defense mechanisms), the first barrier like cell walls, second antimicrobial com-pounds and other secondary metabolites (Hutcheson et al., 2001). Third barrier against the pathogen is the indu-cible plant defense responses (known as active defense mechanisms). After induction of the third barriers in plants, it recognizes general elicitors from pathogen po-pulation in a nonspecific manner to activate its defense machinery. In other way, plants can also recognize pa-thogen surface molecules referred as pathogen-asso-ciated molecular patterns (PAMPs), to induce innate immunity. PAMPs are shared among members of a pathogen group and are known to induce innate immunity in both plants and animals systems. Some of the plant defense responses that are induced because of general elicitors and PAMPs include cell wall thickening, cell wall lignification, and accumulation of phenolics, production of saponins, and production of phytoalexins, papilla forma-tion and induction of pathogensis related genes (Thordal-Christensen, 2006). Like the host systems, nonhost interactions with pathogens can also mount/ induced a battery of induced barriers against pathogen infection. Arabidopsis is a nonhost for P. syringae pv. phaseolicola and when infected with P. syringae pv. phaseolicola, it activates PR gene expression without any visible symp-toms (Dawson and Hilf, 1992). Specific resistance has been extensively studied in host pathosystems and typically follows Flor’s gene-for-gene model (Dixon, 2001), in which resistance is deter-mined by the simultaneous expression of pathogen avirulence (Avr) gene and the corresponding plant resis-tance (R) gene. Most contemporary models of non-host resistance evoke a complex overlay of specific resistance and nonspecific defense responses (Staskawicz et al., 1995). However, the extent to which the gene-for-gene model applies to non-host interactions remains unclear. A classical  genetic  approach  to  this problem is hampered  Shamim et al.          4739    by the absence of variation in plant resistance and patho-gen virulence, as well as by sexual incompatibility bet-ween host and non-host plants. Specific resistance has been extensively studied in host pathosystems and typi-cally follows Flor’s gene-for-gene model. Resistance is determined by the simultaneous expression of pathogen avirulence (Avr) gene with the corresponding plant resis-tance gene, leading to the hypersensitive response (HR), a general defense response of plants that includes apop-totic cell death (Nurnberger and Brunner, 2002). The ex-tent to which the gene-for-gene model can be expanded to non-host interactions remains unclear. However, in many pathosystems, non-host resistance can be explained by the occurrence of an arsenal of R genes that recog-nize multiple or essential Avr genes (Dangl and Jones, 1998). Although historically, the above classifications have been quite stringent, plant pathologists have re-cently begun to appreciate major genetic and molecular intersections between the various types of plant immu-nity. For example, genes such as NPR1 and EDS1/ PAD4, which encode key components of salicylic acid mediated plant defense signaling, were found to be essential for various types of disease resistance (Kamoun, 2001). Likewise, global transcription profiling revealed similar sets of genes whose expression is altered during basal defense, R gene-triggered immunity and in non-host interactions (Lipka et al., 2005; Caldo et al., 2004). NB-LRR and PRR-triggered immunity contri-bute to nonhost resistance such that with increasing phylogenetic divergence time between two plant species, the relative effectiveness of PRR-triggered immunity increases whereas the relative contribution of NB-LRR protein-triggered immunity decreases (Caldo et al., 2004; Zimmerli et al., 2004). The other one mechanistic expla-nation for this could be that effectors from a given pathogen species fail to effectively suppress PRR-trig-gered immunity in nonhosts because their corresponding host cellular targets have diverged in the nonhost to an extent that impedes effective manipulation by the effector repertoire. Additionally, the continuous co-evolutionary arms race between host-adapted pathogens and their hosts appears to drive a more rapid evolution of NB-LRR loci compared to the rest of plant genomes (Schulze-Lefert and Panstruga, 2011).   IDENTIFICATION OF NONHOST RESISTANCE GENE(S) AND NEW ADVANCEMENT IN THROUGH MOLECULAR TOOLS  Identification and advancement in nonhost resistance through molecular tools  Mutants of Arabidopsis (A. thaliana) are used for the identification of several genes that contribute to nonhost resistance against the barley powdery mildew fungus Blumeria  graminis  f. sp. hordei. The study then hypothe- 4740          Afr. J. Microbiol. Res.    sized that the multilayered nonhost resistance was found in plants, with the plant cell wall being the first and rapid cell death the second line of defense. In wild-type plants, inappropriate pathogens to which Arabidopsis is a nonhost are usually stopped at the preinvasive stage of penetration. This penetration resistance is associated with the formation of large cell wall appositions (papillae) enriched in callose, lignin-like material, and hydrogen peroxide (Leister et al., 1998). Upon breaching of this first defense layer, pathogen growth is stopped by a hyper-sensitive reaction of attacked cells, which is associated with auto fluorescence and a hydrogen peroxide burst and which leads to cell death (Stein et al., 2006). Recently, it has been shown that genes of Arabidopsis identified to play an important role in nonhost resistance against powdery mildews also contribute to resistance against nonhost rust fungi such as Phakopsora pachyrhizi (Schweizer, 2007). Arabidopsis NahG plants have a defect in resistance to the non-host bacterial pathogen P. syringae pv. phaseolicola NPS3121 (Psp), suggesting that SA-mediated signaling is required for non-host resistance to this pathogen. In light of the phenotypic differences between NahG and SA-signaling mutants (Loehrer et al., 2008), further investigation of the role of SA signaling in nonhost resistance to Psp ob-served that resistance of Arabidopsis to Psp was affected only in NahG plants and not in other genotypes with defects in SA signaling (Lu et al., 2001). Therefore, non-host resistance to Psp is independent of SA signaling. In the nonhost interactions of barley with inappropriate rust fungi, a better understanding of the genetic basis of nonhost resistance was achieved recently by accumu-lating susceptibility alleles in a series of consecutive crosses, which resulted in two barley lines with essen-tially full susceptibility to nonhost rusts (Wees and Glazebrook, 2003). It was concluded, therefore, that nonhost resistance, at least to rust fungi, might depend on a complex and functionally redundant set of genes in barley. Barley (Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare) has been reported to be a nonhost to the wheat powdery mildew fungus Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, the wheat leaf rust (Rust) fungus Puccinia triticina, and isolate CD180 (CD) from the genus Magnaporthe that is asso-ciated with the host Pennisetum species (Atienza et al., 2004).  A maize R gene recognizes a rice pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola, which causes bacterial streak disease in rice. Although X. o. pv. oryzicola does not cause disease on maize, though identified Rxo1 gene, a maize plant gene, conditions a resistance reaction to a diverse collection of pathogenic strains of X. oryzae. pv. oryzicola. Surprisingly, Rxo1 also controls resistance to the unrelated pathogen Burkholderia andropogonis, which causes bacterial stripe of sorghum and maize. The same gene also controls resistance reactions to both host pathogens and nonhost pathogens of maize. Rxo1 has a nucleotide-binding  site  leucine-rich repeat structure, simi-     similar to many previously identified R genes (Zellerhoff et al., 2006). Most importantly, Rxo1 functions after trans-fer as a transgene to rice, demonstrating the feasibility of nonhost R gene transfer between cereals and providing a valuable tool for controlling bacterial streak disease. The function of Rxo1 in rice demonstrates that an NBS-LRR type of R gene can be effectively transferred between distantly related cereals. In similar experiments, maize Rp1 genes, which are also NBS-LRR genes, did not func-tion in wheat and barley (Ramakrishna et al., 2002). Other NBS-LRR R genes also have a restricted taxono-mic functionality (Zhao et al., 2005), although some aspects of their function can sometimes be detected after transfer between distantly related species (Tai et al., 1999). If other R genes function in heterologous cereal backgrounds, it will have a significant impact on strate-gies to improve disease resistance in most crops. Con-sidering that the NBS-LRR genes account for >1% of genes in the rice genome (Frost et al., 2004) and the thousands of different species of grasses, this could provide a deep resource of R genes to control different phytopathogens. In the case of Rxo1, the maize gene confers broad resistance to a diverse group of X. oryzae. pv. oryzicola strains in rice (Monosi et al., 2004), where no R genes for this disease are known in host species. Some of the identified nonhost specific genes have novel functions when compared with known host-specific resis-tance and defense-related genes, respectively, revealing the existence of separate signaling and effector compo-nents (Mysore and Ryu, 2004). Some insights were also gained on the nature of elicitors leading to host species-specificity of Magnaporthe grisea (Murakami et al., 2003) and X. oryzae (Sweigard et al., 1995) suggesting that in some cases major genes appear to control host speci-ficity and are likely to be recognized by specific plant receptors, yet to be identified.  Molecular mechanisms underlying HR of rice to its bacterial pathogen Xoc is mediated by a nonhost maize R gene. Rxo1 were investigated using a microarray expe-riment and a pair of transgenic and non-transgenic rice lines. Rxo1 appeared to function in the very early step of the interaction between rice and Xoc, and could speci-fically activate large numbers of genes involved in signal-ling pathways leading to HR and some basal defensive pathways such as SA and ET pathways. In the former case, Rxo1 appeared to differ from the typical host R genes in that it could lead to HR without activating NDR1. In the later cases, Rxo1 was able to induce a unique group of set of WRKY transcription factor genes and a large set of genes encoding PPR proteins that share the same G-box in their promoter regions with possible func-tions in post transcriptional regulation. Some key genes that function in the downstream of Rxo1 were identified, including OsNPR1 and OsPR1. Results elucidated some interesting aspects on the molecular mechanism of the non-host resistance of rice mediated by Rxo1 and provi-ded  useful  information  to  understand  the  evolution of      plant resistance genes (Zhao et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2010). Progress has been made in the model plant Arabidop-sis, to a better understanding of the genes and pathways underlying nonhost resistance. The molecular basis of nonhost resistance is of obvious interest due to its durability, and potential transfer of this resistance mecha-nism(s) by transgenic approach to crop plants that are hosts of a given pathogen species will give a tool to better resistance. Future, research to find additional nonhost resistance gene against the important pathogens requires inter discipline approaches of genomics, struc-tural biology, advanced genomics and bioinformatics tools. Genomics approaches will contribute by identifying candidate nonhost gene(s) and their determination of the positive selection. Structural biology is essential to understand the mode of interaction and inhibition of the pathogen. Advanced proteomics includes not only the sensitive pull down array to identifying and interaction but also activity based protein based assay for the determi-nation of pathogen and non-host interaction. The potential of finding additional non-host gene(s) for the important pathogens is tremendous for better disease resistance. For all given the clear action of mechanism of action of the non-host resistance may be the additional layers of manipulation of several plant species with the molecular battlefield to the non-host resistance.

disturbance hypothesis,156684036,The intermediate disturbance hypothesis: Patch dynamics and mechanisms of species coexistence,,"Roxburgh, Stephen, Shea, Katriona, Wilson, J Bastow",2015,"The intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) has been used for several decades as an explanation for the coexistence of species in ecological communities. It is intuitively simple, but deceptively so. We show, via discussion and examples, that the IDH is not one mechanism of coexistence, but rather summarizes a set of similar phenomena that can arise from the action of several different coexistence mechanisms. These underlying mechanisms are defined by the various ways in which species differ in their response to disturbance-induced spatial and temporal variability in resources and environmental conditions. As an example, the original specification of the IDH required patchy disturbances for coexistence. However, because the underlying mechanisms of coexistence can also operate at the within-patch scale, patchy disturbances are not a necessary requirement for coexistence under intermediate-disturbance regimes. These conclusions are illustrated through the analysis of three models: a spatial within-patch model, a spatial between-patch model, and a purely temporal model. All three generate similar patterns of coexistence under intermediate disturbance, yet underlying that coexistence lie at least two quite-distinct mechanisms of species coexistence: the storage effect and relative nonlinearity. The results from our analyses suggest that, as a promoter of species coexistence, the IDH is both broader in scope and richer in detail than has previously been recognized",,Journal article,"Keywords: coexistence; community ecology; environmental factor; intermediate disturbance hypothesis; patch dynamics Coexistence, mechanisms of; Environmental variability; Intermediate disturbance hypothesis; Nonlinearity, relative; Patch dynamics; Reciprocal-yield law (RYL) model; Species coexistence, storage effect",issn:0012-9658,Ecological Society of America

disturbance hypothesis,79182435,A succession of theories : purging redundancy from disturbance theory,10.1111/brv.12163,"Pulsford, Stephanie A., Lindenmayer, David B., Driscoll, Don A.",2016,"The topics of succession and post-disturbance ecosystem recovery have a long and convoluted history. There is extensive redundancy within this body of theory, which has resulted in confusion, and the links among theories have not been adequately drawn. This review aims to distil the unique ideas from the array of theory related to ecosystem change in response to disturbance. This will help to reduce redundancy, and improve communication and understanding between researchers. We first outline the broad range of concepts that have developed over the past century to describe community change in response to disturbance. The body of work spans overlapping succession concepts presented by Clements in 1916, Egler in 1954, and Connell and Slatyer in 1977. Other theories describing community change include state and transition models, biological legacy theory, and the application of functional traits to predict responses to disturbance. Second, we identify areas of overlap of these theories, in addition to highlighting the conceptual and taxonomic limitations of each. In aligning each of these theories with one another, the limited scope and relative inflexibility of some theories becomes apparent, and redundancy becomes explicit. We identify a set of unique concepts to describe the range of mechanisms driving ecosystem responses to disturbance. We present a schematic model of our proposed synthesis which brings together the range of unique mechanisms that were identified in our review. The model describes five main mechanisms of transition away from a post-disturbance community: (i) pulse events with rapid state shifts; (ii) stochastic community drift; (iii) facilitation; (iv) competition; and (v) the influence of the initial composition of a post-disturbance community. In addition, stabilising processes such as biological legacies, inhibition or continuing disturbance may prevent a transition between community types. Integrating these six mechanisms with the functional trait approach is likely to improve the predictive capacity of disturbance theory. Finally, we complement our discussion of theory with a case study which emphasises that many post-disturbance theories apply simultaneously to the same ecosystem. Using the well-studied mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forests of south-eastern Australia, we illustrate phenomena that align with six of the theories described in our model of rationalised disturbance theory. We encourage further work to improve our schematic model, increase coverage of disturbance-related theory, and to show how the model may link to, or integrate with, other domains of ecological theory",,Journal Article,"facilitation, habitat accommodation, inhibition, initial floristic composition, intermediate disturbance hypothesis, life-history traits, neutral metacommunity, resource gradient, tolerance, vital attributes",,'Wiley'

In the first phase of research, authors confirm the presence of autocorrelation in the background of seismic noise, using the measurement of real fault movement, and the recorded ground shaking before and after an earthquake. In the second stage of the research, authors firstly develop a mean-field model, which accurately enough describes the dynamics of a starting block model, with the introduced delayed interaction among the blocks, while colored noise is assumed to be generated by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The results of the analysis indicate the existence of three different dynamical regimes, which correspond to three regimes of fault motion: steady stationary state, aseismic creep and seismic fault motion. The effect of colored noise lies in the possibility of generating the seismic fault motion even for small values of correlation time.

We find that: (1) no matter which population is disturbed, increasing the intensity of disturbance improves the ability of the system leaves steady state and thus decreases the stability. The root-mean-square amplification envelope rises with increasing disturbance intensity, (2) the system is more sensitive to the disturbance of the predator than disturbance to prey, (3) ρmax and tmax are important indicators, which represent the intensity and time of maximum amplification by disturbance.

It is assumed that the accident may have accelerated the slowdown of the Gulf Stream and changed its path, which led to a change in temperature, salinity and density of significant ocean masses. Variations of ocean mass density in some areas could cause a shift of the Earth’s center of mass by 10–5 m and a deviation of its rotation axis by 2.9∙10–6 arcsec. It is shown that the process of disturbance of the Earth’s dynamic balance can be accompanied by an increase in the number of relatively weak earthquakes (in a range of magnitudes 4.2–4.8 by 41.5%) and the intensity of seismic noise (tremor), as shown by broadband seismic networks and satellite GPS navigation data",,Text,,,EDP Sciences

Control problems arise in the plant mustbe solved in the plant. Until plant engineers and controldesigners are able to communicate with each other, their mut-ual problems await solution.” [1]The questions remain: (1) is there an advance control conceptthat worth sharing? (2) If so, how can it be communicated to “thepeople who must apply them”?Our thesis is therefore quite straightforward: the mutual problemof plant engineers and control designers, which has awaited solution,is the problem of disturbance and it should be the focus of the studyin automatic control, the foundation of which begins with the verynotion of disturbance, to which we now turn.2. The evolving notion of disturbanceLike any branch of science, the current generation of researchersin automatic control inherited a particular point of view, an implicitparadigm and an assumed value judgment from the previousgenerations, the protégés of which continue to shape this disciplinefrom their positions in academia. In the true spirit of science, allpoints of view, including and especially, the ones that have beendominant, must be continuously reﬂected upon and judged forrelevance and validity. All theories must be scrutinized and veriﬁedin practice; cherry picking of evidence to support a particular view,while unavoidable, must be discouraged. “We must be mindful offoundation”, as Prof. Astrom recently advised, or “the building mightfall” [2]. Our understanding must be absolutely clear concerningthe basic concepts, such as the meaning of disturbance or rejection,before a solid foundation of automatic control is built.Speciﬁcally, disturbance rejection is a ubiquitous term usedin control theory and it is one of the many design considerations intextbook techniques from loop-shaping to H1. It has essentiallybecome an academic jargon and is used freely without a secondthought. In reality, the word “disturbance” takes on differentmeanings as it is used in various contexts, often unknowingly. Itoften refers to a disruption coming from an external force, as, forexample, wind gust acting on an airplane; in some other cases,however, it may not be entirely clear whether the disruption iscoming from within or without. People seldom, if ever, ask “whatdo you mean by disturbance?” or “in what sense a disturbance issaid to be rejected?”Going back to the Oxford Dictionary of English again, the word“disturb” means “interfere with the normal arrangement or function-ing of”, fromwhich “disturbance” is inferred to as something abnormal,not part of the original plan, but tends to disrupt it. It is usedsynonymously with uncertainty an automatic control system isdesigned to deal with. “If there is no uncertainty in the system, thecontrol, or the environment, feedback control is largely unnecessary”[3], said renowned control theorist R. Brockett. If one is only concernedwith the type of the uncertainties that tend to “interfere with thenormal arrangement or functioning of”, then the problem of uncer-tainty is no different from the problem of disturbance and will bedenoted so in this paper for the sake of simplicity and clarity.As in any human endeavor, a lot of what is being done stemsfrom habits, consciously or otherwise. It is a habit that the problemassociated with the uncertainties internal (external) to a physicalsystem is denoted as the robustness (disturbance) problem. Infact, such robustness problem has become a dominant theme inmodern control theory and the topic of endless books and papers;the disturbance problem, on the other hand, is narrowly deﬁnedand is treated without much fanfare. The real world, however,does not draw a line to separate internal uncertainty from theexternal one. In a robot manipulator, for example, what would onecall the problem caused by the coupling among various joints?To each joint the disturbance coming from other joints areexternal but to the robot as a whole all joints are internal.Treating the coupling among joints in a robot manipulatoras robustness problem presupposes the detailed mathematicalmodel of it, which could be quite nonlinear and complex. Thispractical hindrance led researchers to a shortcut: to each joint, thecoupling force from other joints can be estimated in real time andcanceled, resulting in a much simpler and more effective solutioncalled disturbance observer (DOB) [4]. But by habit, the notion ofdisturbance used in the framework of DOB distinctly refers tosomething external, even though the solution equally applies todisturbances that are state dependent, thus creating an awkward-ness in articulating exactly what kind of uncertainties with whichthe method deals.This conceptual ambiguity was resolved once for all by Han inhis landmark paper of 1989, which for the ﬁrst time put forwardthe idea that, for the purpose of controlling a physical process,linear or nonlinear, having a complete mathematical model isboth impractical and unnecessary [5]. Physical system, Hanbelieves, can be controlled without a mathematical model becausethe information it needs can be extracted from the input–outputinformation. Hanwent on to open a new front of automatic controland spent the next two decades cultivating it [6–8]. This new areaof research is known as active disturbance rejection control(ADRC), with the “disturbance” referring to both internal (statedependent) and external forces that are unknown.The work of Han demonstrates that many boundaries in controltheory are artiﬁcial, reﬂecting not the nature of automatic controlbut our limitations in comprehending it. Such boundaries includethose that divide the systems as linear and nonlinear controls,internal dynamic uncertainty and external disturbance, timevarying and time invariance, etc. In fact, all these problems canbe seen as one and the same: the problem of disturbance, if theword “disturbance” is allowed to take on the more general mean-ing described above. Perhaps the most unique contribution fromHan's work is his notion of disturbance, which includes uncertain-ties both internal and external to the physical process[6–8]. A more detailed account will be given later in this paper.Taking it one step further, the term disturbance can now beused to denote the difference between what the system is andwhat it is should be, whether this difference belongs to theinternal or external uncertainties. But “what it should be” seemsproblem dependent, vague and ﬂeeting; it seems tied to theparticular system of interests, not easily describable as a universalconcept.With a penetrating insight, Han gave answer to this puzzlein 1979 by showing that under reasonable conditions, all linearand nonlinear systems can be reduced to the cascade integral formthat he termed “canonical form of feedback systems” [9], which isdenoted in this paper, for the sake of convenience, as Form Han(FH). In other words, most systems, linear or nonlinear, with statefeedback, can be transformed into FH, based on which controldesign can be standardized. Therefore, FH becomes the point ofdeparture for all design methods because various types of physicalsystems, once they are reduced to FH, are identical dynamicallyand can be controlled by a standard, ﬁxed controller.Note that FH anticipates much of the later, more complete, workon generalized control canonical form for linear and nonlinearsystems by M. Fliess and others. See [22] for details and referencestherein. In particular, Han discussed in [9] the problem of transform-ing a general nonlinear system to the control canonical form by theuse of input-dependent state transformation, to which Fliess gave arather expanded account a decade later [22].Han also gives us an alternative answer to the above questionof “what an ideal plant should be”. Using FH as the ideal plant,controllers are readily designed to meet the design speciﬁcations.To Han, the problem of automatic control comes down to theproblem of what to do with such disturbance, to which weturn next.3. Disturbance attenuation vs. disturbance rejection: aconceptual divideTo grasp for universal principles with explanation power is a partof human nature. The task has puzzled the mankind from thebeginning of civilization, in the quest to transcend the particulars,and it is especially challenging for engineers, who tend to focus onhow things are done and not to dwell on what to be done and why.The terms feedback and feedforward, for example, are solutions butthe problems they solve are seldom explained clearly. What doesfeedback do exactly? Prof. Wiener called it “a method of controllinga system by reinserting into it the results of its past performance”[10]. But why? What is the aim and how is it helpful in making thesystem remember what it has done in the past? Similarly, in theliterature we see terms like “two-degree-of-freedom” (2DOF) or“combined system”, begging the questions of “the freedom to dowhat?” and “what is combined and why?”There is a profound reason for such difﬁculty. In modern times,the presentation of an idea becomes increasingly more important,to the point of “presentation is everything”. In the ﬁeld ofautomatic control, engineering insights were gradually replacedin scholarly transactions by elegant but sometimes empty math-ematical symbols and academic jargons. “Everywhere that whichis apparent on the surface is reprinted, but nowhere (with veryfew exceptions) does the investigation go below the surface”, saidProf. Trinks in 1919 [11]. How much progress has been made sincethen is an open question.In this section, we strive to continue what Prof. Trinks startedin his “book of essentials and principles”: to make clear thefundamental concepts and principles of automatic control. MartinLuther King dreamed that a person is judged not on the color of hisskin but on the contents of his character. Likewise, we dream thatin the ﬁeld of automatic control, a scholar and her scholarly workare judged on the contents of her ideas, whoever and whereverthe person is.3.1. The notion of disturbance rejectionThe term “disturbance rejection” used in the context of classicaland modern control theory refers to how the external disturbanceis attenuated as it is propagated through the process, eventuallyaffecting the output. It is measured as the magnitude of thefrequency response that deﬁnes the disturbance–output relation-ship. It is speciﬁed, usually, in terms of the amount of attenuationand the corresponding frequency range required. Used in such amanner, “rejection” is synonymous to attenuation, or mitigation,or compensation. Shaping system response, in frequency domain,to external disturbances is what it really means by “disturbancerejection” in the current textbooks on control, unfortunately.The word “reject” comes from Latin, meaning “throw back”,and it has a derivative, rejector, to which we will come back.The word “reject” projects a sense of totality and ﬁnality, regardingthe object of concern. Putting the two words together “disturbancerejection” should, and therefore does from now on, mean literally “no”interruptions, whatsoever, of “a peaceful and settled condition”. If, asdiscussed above, the problem of automatic control is the problemof disturbance, then disturbance rejection is absolutely central.To be clear, in an ideal control system, the disturbance, the sumtotal of the internal dynamics and the external forces, should haveabsolutely no effect on the operation of the system as designed!Idealization is a powerful tool in science that helps us distilledpure concepts from messy details of everyday world, as shownin Newtonian physics (the ﬁrst law of motion) and Einstein'stheory of relativity (a human traveling at the speed of light).Likewise, the concept of disturbance rejection, as deﬁned above,helps us escape the drudgery of academic jargons and engineeringidiosyncrasies, to arrive at a universal goal, common to allengineered systems. And, as a side note not to be pursued further,it would not be difﬁcult to see how important disturbancerejection, as redeﬁned, is to us human beings in the happinessand peacefulness of our lives.The renewed conception of disturbance rejection will help usreestablish the “essentials and principles”, as shown below.3.2. The principle of ﬂyball governor and disturbance attenuationIdealization and FH allow us to grasp the principle behindthe ﬂyball governor as follows. Let u be the input (driving force),y the output (engine speed), and r the reference (desired speed).In the engine speed control system with the ﬂyball governor, thesteam ﬂow that provides the driving force to rotate the engineshaft is made proportional to the tracking error deﬁned as e¼ry.That is, the FH of steam engine isJ _y¼ u ð1Þwhere J is the inertia and the ﬂyball governor is described asu¼ kpe ð2Þwhere kp is the gain of the governor. The idea behind (2) is that if yis to be governed to follow a given value r, then its derivativeneeds to be made proportional to the tracking error e¼ry. Andthis is denoted as the principle of ﬂyball governor (PFG), which iswhat behind the invention but has not been articulated as suchuntil now.From the PFG as deﬁned, it can be seen why people had a hardtime swallowing it. “The principle in question has been pro-nounced defective and faulty, because, to cause the governor toact, it necessitates a change in the quantity to be kept constant”,Trinks wrote in 1919 [11], in the ﬁrst comprehensive book on thegovernors and the principles of governing in the English literature.In other words, substantial tracking error must exist, no matterwhat caused it, before the governor can act on it for the purpose ofreducing it to zero. But there is always a cause–effect relationshipbehind the tracking error; the PFG basically ignores the cause butacts on the effect. It is for this reasonwe denote the PFG also as theprinciple of disturbance attenuation (PDA) and its explanationpowers go far beyond the steam engine. In fact, much of whathas been in the realm of existing control theory can be seen asrooted in PDA. It is ubiquitous but unstated in all aspects ofautomatic control, theory and practice.Described more generally, there is ﬁrst a causal relationshipbetween the control variable (input or cause) and the controlledvariable (output or effect); second, there is a desired value for theoutput (setpoint); third, there is an unaccounted force (distur-bance) that tends to drive the output away from its desired value;ﬁnally the control variable is made a function of the differencebetween the output and its desired value, thus closing the loop.That is, the control action is driven by the difference between thecontrolled variable, i.e. the output, and its desired value for thepurpose of attenuating the effect of the disturbance.“Faulty” as it appears to be, the PFG, or PDA, survived. It indicatesa foundational characteristic an automatic control system possesses:the ability to adjust, by itself, in response to disturbances and toreturn to the “settled condition” of its original design. This act of“governing” gives the mechanism the name “governor”, from whichthe name “cybernetics” is derived. In other words, cyberneticsymbolizes a principle of governing that can be described as PDA; itis a goal for which feedback is the means.To rest the entire control theory on the notion of feedback,unfortunately, is to mistake the goal for the means. The mistake isthe result of the obsession with the “how” at the cost of ignoringthe “what” and the “why”. Feedback control is how we accom-plished disturbance attenuation; it is not the goal in itself. Aparticular governor is designed to govern and is but one embodi-ment of governing. But to mistake governing itself as a particulargovernor, no matter how great it is, is unfortunate. Sadly that isexactly what happened, as the well-respected historian, Otto Mayr,testiﬁes that “this ﬁeld [of automatic control] is essentially basedupon a single idea, that of feedback loop” [12]. In other words,the problem of automatic control has been mistaken as that offeedback loop.3.3. The principle of isochronous governor and disturbance rejectionIn the idealize form, the ﬂyball governor of (1) and (2) wouldnever oscillate. But in reality it does, because, as Poncelet [13]points out, there are two sets of motions involved: the motion ofsteam engine, i.e. the plant, and the motion of the ﬂyball, i.e. thecontroller. Clerk Maxwell set mathematical control theory on itspath of development by describing the control system with adifferential equation and determining the condition of oscillationfrom its characteristic polynomial. Routh continued this line ofinvestigation [14] but came to an erroneous conclusion that thecause of the oscillation is that the governor acts too fast, notrealizing it is the lag in the action of the governor that causes theoscillation, as pointed out by Poncelet.To solve the oscillation problem Poncelet proposed the Iso-chronous Governor, one that does not have any lag, ideally, in action.Linearizing the steam engine at a particular operating point, asimpliﬁed equation isJ _y¼ ayþdþu ð3Þwith a as the friction coefﬁcient and d is the external disturbance.The sudden appearance of the disturbance force, d, tends tojolt the engine out of its equilibrium. Poncelet sketched a diagramof a different type of governor, namely the Isochronous Governor,that measures d and cancels its effect on the engine with aninstantaneous opposing action of steam valve. This is denoted asPoncelet's principle in [11]. A more descriptive deﬁnition adoptedhere is principle of disturbance rejection (PDR), which is the oppositeof PDA.If PDA signiﬁes an acceptance, an admission, however reluc-tant, that the operation of the process will be interrupted orinterfered with by disturbance, the principle of disturbance rejec-tion (PDR) is exactly the opposite. True to the root meaning of theword “reject”, PDR signiﬁes the idea that the causes of the outputdeviation, i.e. disturbance, can be determined and “thrown back”,i.e. canceled. Furthermore, once this cause is removed, the outputdeviation can be, to a large extent, avoided. And this is the maindifference between PDA and PDR.Perhaps the earliest example of PDR is the South-PointingChariot (SPC) that, by legend, goes all the way back to the YellowEmperor of the third millennium BC, the ancestor of all Chinese[15]. This apparatus has a ﬁgure mounted on top of a chariot witha ﬁnger always pointing to the south, no matter how the chariotmoves and turns. It is made possible by an ingenious gear systemthat measures the rotation of the chariot, from the difference inrotation between the wheels on either side, and counter rotatesthe pointing ﬁgure by the same amount.Note that in this governor, the output is not measured, thedisturbance (rotation of the chariot) is. That is, there is no outputfeedback, as is deﬁned in feedback control texts. In this sense,Poncelet's Isochronous Governor is quite similar to SPC, as thesteam valve is immediately adjusted by the detection of the loadchange. More than a century later, Poncelet's idea was revived andformalized as invariance principle (IP) by Shipanov from the thenSoviet Union in the form of a set of mathematical conditions underwhich the output of a process is made “invariant” in the presenceof an external disturbance [16]; it led to the two-channel principle[17] where the disturbance is measured and fed to controller forthe purpose of achieving the “absolute invariance”, i.e. the idealdisturbance rejection.Clearly evident in Poncelet and Shipanov's work is the recogni-tion that the problem of control is that of disturbance rejection,despite the various limitations in their solutions. This point viewgreatly inﬂuenced a Chinese graduate student who studied inMoscow in 1960s and later made the next breakthrough in the1990s, continuing the progress of this idea that simply refuses togo away [5–8,18,19].Han deﬁnes disturbance in a more general sense, to includeuncertainties both internal and external. To reject such distur-bances, according to Han, requires that their impact on the processbe equivalent to an uncertainty in the input channel, which can betreated as an extended state, estimated via a state observer, andcanceled by the control action. This new framework of a general-ized notion of disturbance, its estimation and cancellation, and thecontrol of the remaining plant by various means were system-atically and meticulously developed by Han over a period of twodecades, leading to what is known as active disturbance rejectioncontrol (ADRC).Speciﬁcally, by including dynamic uncertainties as a part ofdisturbance internal to the process, a much broader framework isestablished that could unite the previously separated subjectsin control theory: robustness, adaptive control, and disturbancerejection in the narrow sense, etc., reducing the basic problems ofautomatic control to disturbance rejection. In doing so, theprevious principles of Poncelet and Shipanov are made applicableto those processes where the model is mostly unknown and thedisturbance is now estimated, not measured, making it a muchmore practical solution.4. Disturbance rejector and disturbance rejection controlClose to 200 years had passed from Watt's invention of ﬂyballgovernor to Wiener's articulation of feedback as the underlyingconcept with enormous explanation power. Consequently, theprevious terminologies used by different groups of practitionersfrom different places at different times were uniﬁed under a singleconcept, the concept of feedback. Correspondingly, the term “con-troller”, if not otherwise qualiﬁed, has become synonymous withthe feedback control mechanism.Likewise, from Yellow Emperor's SPC, to Poncelet's IsochronousGovernor, to Shipanov's invariance principle, and ﬁnally to Han'sADRC, these ingenious human inventions share the distinct, if other-wise unstated, trait of disturbance rejection not found in feedbackcontrol and they also share the unique machinery of a disturbancerejector, in parallel to the controller. Speciﬁcally, “disturbance rejector”,or simply “rejector”, is deﬁned here as a mechanism that obtains thedisturbance information and cancels it out with the control action.Furthermore, the combined controller–rejector pair forms the basicstructure of disturbance rejection control (DRC), as shown, for example,in Fig. 1.The basic idea of DRC is to not let the controller interfacedirectly with the messy physical processes, full of nonlinearities,uncertainties, and other nastiness. Instead, the controller regulatesthe enforced plant, i.e. the transformed plant where the nastinesshas been taken out, more or less, by the rejector. The controller'stask of meeting the design speciﬁcations becomes a lot easierwhen it deals with the enforced plant, which tends to be muchsimpler and less uncertain than the actual process. And this is theidea that has been missing in the controller-only paradigm ofmodern control.Whether it is robust control or adaptive control, or even thefeedback control itself, the goal has always been to deal with unce-rtainties, and at the same time, meet the performance speciﬁcations.But making a single controller do both proves to be unnecessarilycomplex or even intractable at times, to which DRC provides agenuine alternative.4.1. Disturbance rejector, the enforced plant and the renewed notionof modelThe rejector, as deﬁned above and shown in Fig. 1, performstwo key tasks: (1) collecting, processing and communicating thedisturbance and state information; (2) canceling, or eradiating,the disturbance. Within the framework of DRC, the taskof automatic control is shared between the controller and therejector: the rejector rejects and the controller controls. That is,the rejector performs the main task of rejecting disturbance andcontroller forces the output to follow the command.The enforced plant represents the dynamics of the process afterthe disturbance is removed. With the expanded deﬁnition ofdisturbance, even the very notion of the model is redeﬁned.To put it in another way, it is not that DRC is now “model-free”,because no matter how simple it is, there is always a model thatpictures the plant to be controlled, based on which a controller isdesigned; but rather, the very concept of model is renewed.In the traditional concept of mathematical model, patterningafter the natural sciences, the dynamics of a physical system isdescribed as closely as possible by a set of mathematical equations,known as the model. And this set of equations is the starting pointof all analyses and designs. A fundamental, if implicit, premise ofthe entire modern control theory is that the model is given, moreor less. And it is in this sense modern control theory can be seen asthe “doctrine of model"""" suggested by Han [5].In DRC, the demarcation is broken down between what is knownas “internal” dynamics and “external” disturbance. The enforced plantrepresents the dynamics of the system to be controlled; it could be themathematical model of the physical process in its traditional sense, orit could be chosen in the form of FH, or somewhere in between. In anycase, the rejector treats all that is different from the enforced plant as“disturbance” to be rejected. Taking it this way, control design is neverentirely “model-free” or model-independent, even in the case whenthe enforced plant is chosen in the ideal form of FH. Instead, thecontroller is designed for the enforced plant, the ﬁdelity of which inrelation to process dynamics determines the amount of disturbancethe rejector has to contend with. It is in this sense the task ofautomatic control is shared between the controller and the rejector.In modern control, the task is entirely shouldered by thecontroller, in the absence of the rejector and with the premisethat a high ﬁdelity model of the actual process is given. In the caseof ADRC proposed by Han, the complexity of the controller isminimized as all dynamics aside from FH is deemed as disturbanceand rejected, which makes the quality of control system as good asthat of the rejector. The balance between the controller and therejector in practice will fall in the wide range between these two.The better the disturbance estimator, the less the knowledge of theplant dynamics is needed.4.2. Various means of obtaining the disturbance informationThe notion of rejector can perhaps help reorient the previouslynot well organized set of tools in a not well-deﬁned ﬁeld ofresearch. Because of the lack of recognition of the underlyinguniversal principle, even though various forms of disturbanceestimation and rejection have been proposed in the solutions ofvarious problems, the researchers are mostly unaware of the ﬁeldas a whole and each other's work in particular. In early 1970s,the unknown input observer (UIO) was proposed to obtain thedisturbance information with a state observer, assuming that themodel of both the plant and the disturbance was given; in thelate 1980s, another method, the disturbance observer (DOB), wasproposed for robotic manipulators where the disturbance iscalculated by sending the output of the plant to its inverse transferfunction and subtracting the result from the input. DOB was laterbrought into state space to deal with nonlinear system and theequivalency between UIO and DOB was established for lineartime invariant system with external disturbance. In the 1990s,the Extended State Observer (ESO) was proposed speciﬁcally toestimate and cancel “total disturbance” in the context of ADRC.A survey of these and other types of state and disturbanceobservers can be found in [20] and some recent work on DOBbased design in the context of robust control can be found, forexample, in [21].In addition, the recent work of Fliess and Join on “model-freecontrol” shows yet another instance of disturbance rejector atwork [23], albeit anonymously, the uniqueness of which resides inthe real time estimation of disturbances using the algebraicidentiﬁcation method and the proposition that most, if not all,physical systems can be treated as ﬁrst- or second-order system[24]. Another form of rejector is the embedded model controlapproach proposed by Canuto [25] where the uncertainty isestimated online and canceled with control action. These are buta few examples, all of which can be well explained by the conceptof total disturbance and the structure of DRC, shown in Fig. 1,and understood as a design philosophy of actively estimating andcanceling the total disturbance, regardless of the means. In doingso, all methods discussed above share a common objective, under-standing, and structure; the only difference is in how the dis-turbance is estimated and in the premises made.4.3. Disturbance-free control and a paradigm shiftThe unifying concept of disturbance rejector, together with thestructure of DRC, marks both a paradigm shift in how controlleris designed and a conceptual turning point in how disturbance isdealt with. The schematics of control system took a drasticallydifferent form, as shown in Fig. 1. Note that although the internaland external disturbances are very different in nature and theyenter into the process throughout its physical layout, they arenonetheless lumped into the “total disturbance” that affects theFig. 1. Disturbance rejection control.process in the same channel where the process input is, and thereis a deep insight behind.Speciﬁcally, all disturbances that could cause the output tochange is, in a sense, observable; furthermore, since the processinput by design is to cause the output to change, the output changedue to any disturbances, no matter what the actual disturbance is,can be seen as the result of input abnormality; ﬁnally the processinput, in turn, can be manipulated to cancel this abnormality and toreturn the process dynamics to that of the ideal, disturbance-free,form. It is for this reason that the DRC perhaps can be betterunderstood as disturbance-free control (DFC).This kind of disturbance rejection is deemed active because itdoesn't wait for the disturbance to work its way through thephysical process and cause signiﬁcant changes in the stateand output. The Total Disturbance Estimator in Fig. 1 denotes themachinery for this purpose and it can take on various forms andnames, as discussed above. Regardless of the particular mechan-ism employed to estimate the disturbance, the role of the Rejectorcancels it by subtracting its estimate from the process input. Most,if not all, mechanisms of disturbance rejection described earliercan be reduced to the structure of DRC in Fig. 1, in which theelusive universal principle, the principle of disturbance rejection,is on vivid display.To describe it yet in another way, Han deﬁnes that themathematical model of all feedback systems to be controlled asthat of FH, i.e. in the cascade integral form, on which the controllercan be designed using any existing method. The job of disturbancerejector is to enforce this model by estimating and canceling allthe discrepancies in the physical system. In this framework, thedifﬁcult and complex control problems, such as those associatedwith nonlinear, uncertain, time-varying process of multi-input andmulti-output with strong couplings among variables, becomeeasily solvable after the rejector has done its work. In this sense,the rejector is also an enforcer, enforcing the plant to behave likeFH and inducing a completely different mindset on how controlsystem is designed.This disturbance-centric paradigm shift in control designsymbolizes a drastic departure from the so called modern controltheory. To be speciﬁc, it calls into question the very basic premise:what needs to be understood, at the minimum, regarding thephysical process to be controlled. To assume complete knowledge ofit, more or less, is to assume the problem away, more or less. Itmerely shifts the burden from control to system identiﬁcation,often at a signiﬁcant cost. But the history shows that the tempta-tion of mathematization of automatic control is too strong toresist: the problem of control design can be turned into a problem ofmathematical deduction if both the measure of optimality and thephysical process can be reduced to a set of precise mathematicalequations. In reality, however, neither is the case; to insist other-wise, to continue to ignore the facts in control practice, is merelydelusional.The practice of control engineering, just like any other humanactivities, is full of trade-offs, which are hard to put in precisemathematical terms. The beneﬁts are always weighed against thecosts, manifested in various forms. All practitioners are concernedwith cost and, by extension, the economy of model: high ﬁdelitycomes with a high cost and it must be justiﬁed by the beneﬁtsgained. For example, the use of model predictive control, withcostly models, can be justiﬁed in certain applications in processindustry, even though it is still dominated by PID as a whole.Arguably, the prevalence of PID in all industry sectors speaksa single truth: the cost of model-centric design, as suggested bymodern control theory, does not justify its costs in general. By thesame token, high gain designs, as advocated by some preeminentscholars, often ignored the associated high cost. This failure inrecognizing the cost–beneﬁt relationship is at the bottom of theexisting theory–practice divide that is still poorly understood, itappears. On the other hand, the reality of control design with lowﬁdelity models, or with no models at all as some claimed,necessarily shift our attention in control engineering back to theproblem of total disturbance. This is at the core of the “paradigmshift” in control science: shifting from model-centric to disturbance-centric in framework and in mindset. The result could be profound,as further explained next.4.4. A Copernican momentThe controller–rejector tandem, shown in Fig. 1, provides a rareCopernican moment where our fundamental conception of auto-matic control is transformed. Ever since the inception of moderncontrol in the middle of the last century, the mathematical modelof the physical process is presumed given and is the point ofdeparture for analysis and synthesis. Unlike the ﬁlter design,control design is generally not reusable and is thus performedfor each problem, under each set of speciﬁcations. Everythingrevolves around the mathematical model that supposedly capturesthe plant dynamics globally. But is this absolutely necessary?Is this an overkill that puts unnecessary burden on the part ofmodeling? Is it realistic to assume complete knowledge of thephysical process globally? There were the questions Han contem-plated over two decades ago and his answer was a resounding no[5]! Interestingly, Fliess and his collaborators [23] later came to thesimilar conclusions, symbolized by their ultra-local model ofdynamic systems. The remarkable parallel between Han's earliervision and Fliess's later work is striking, even though they wereseparated geographically, culturally, and in time.This Copernican moment, this completely different orientationof the minds, is on vivid display in Fig. 1, where the controllerneeds to be designed only once and where the rejector forces thephysical process of all kinds, linear or nonlinear, time varying ortime invariant, deterministic or stochastic, etc. to behave like thepredetermined enforced plant based on which the controller isdesigned. When the enforced plant is chosen to be in the form ofFH, for example, the rejector treats all departures from FH asdisturbances and cancels it with the control action. Instead ofvarious controller designs revolving around the mathematicalmodel of the plant, this time, in this framework of the control-ler–rejector tandem, the plants revolve around the controller,trying to ﬁt into the form the controller dictates, with the helpof the rejector!The center of the universe is therefore shifted from the modelof the plant to the controller. All imperfections and uncertaintiesin the process are lumped into what is known as total disturbanceto be rejected. In other words, instead of making a controlleradjust to the process, like in adaptive or robust control, the processis made “disturbance-free”, by the rejector, to adjust to what thecontroller is designed for. This, after all, is the authentic doctrineof control, as Han anticipated some 20 years ago, where theproblem of automatic control is not assumed away and wherethe problem of disturbance has returned to its proper place:the center and focus of automatic control. There will be a periodof transition, of course, perhaps a generation or more, for thisCopernican-like revolution in automatic control to take its course,because it necessarily leads to the devaluation of certain principlesand methodologies previously held in high esteem. And it will be achallenging transition, to say the least, for the scholars who builttheir careers and reputations within the conﬁne of the moderncontrol paradigm. But this ideal of disturbance-free control capturesthe essence of what engineers all aspire to achieve and it willeventually prevail.5. Conclusions and outlookIn this paper, we ﬁrst reestablished the concepts of disturbance,disturbance rejection, and disturbance rejection control, the pillarsof the on-going investigation. In particular, the expanded notionof disturbance brings under a single umbrella both the state-dependent internal uncertainties and the unknown external for-ces. This gives us a new paradigm to address the problems of allmajor branches of modern control theory, such as robust control,nonlinear control, decoupling, adaptive control. In other words,most problems of robust control, nonlinear control, decoupling,adaptive control, etc., can be reformulated as particular formsof disturbance problem and solved in a completely new andexciting way.Furthermore, two important but otherwise unannounced prin-ciples of automatic control are articulated in this paper: theprinciple of disturbance accommodation and the principle ofdisturbance rejection, with the distinction between them settingthe stage for a new synthesis. The notion of disturbance rejector isproposed by which previously overlapping concepts and methodsof disturbance estimation and cancellation are now ﬁnally uniﬁed.The controller–rejector pair in the framework of disturbancerejection control signiﬁes a sea change in how we understandthe business of automatic control: from a model-centric to acontrol-centric cosmic view; it reminds us of the Copernicanrevolution in the early days of modern science. It helps us returnto the journey that started some thousand years ago: to make ourengineered systems disturbance-free.With the renewed focus on disturbance rejection and a freshnew look at automatic control, low hanging fruits abound in therealms of both academic research and technological develop-ments. Led by ADRC, this new form of solutions has found manyﬁelds of applications, including, but certainly not limited to,industrial controls such as servo, temperature, web tension; aero-space and aeronautics; high energy physics, to name a few. Thereaders are referred to [26] for a summary of these applications.Between the early work on ﬂight control [27] and the latest newson the adoption by the industry giant Texas Instruments [28], themounting evidence testiﬁes for the thesis of this paper: thecentrality of disturbance rejection in control engineering practice.There are enormous opportunities that come with the newparadigm of control science, including three areas of new dis-coveries that will likely see immense growth in the near future:principles, technologies and applications, as shown in Fig. 2. Inaddition, theoretical analysis and justiﬁcation are needed for allthree areas, just like the work of Bode and Nyquist which justiﬁedand made it intelligible the invention of feedback ampliﬁer.In particular, under principles, a summarily study of all princi-ples of controller and rejector design, once completed, should giveus a fresh new outlook on the state of automatic control anddirections for new discoveries. For example, Fliess and Sira-Ramirez's [24] work on algebraic identiﬁcation provides a drasti-cally different means for disturbance estimation in the future;Fliess and Join's [23] new take on model-free control threatens theconventional deﬁnition of the system order and gives a provokingnew distinction: the order of the process as it is understood andthat as it is controlled. The exposition of such distinction is of greatinterests but beyond of the scope of this paper.In terms of technologies, the new principles of disturbancerejection, as applied to address critical needs in every industrysectors, will likely lead to brand new control technologies. Thenew motion control technology based ADRC is but one example [28].Finally, in terms of applications, the domain experts, oncebrought up to speed with the new design concepts, will see thefundamental change in not just how control is designed, but alsohow systems and solutions are conceived. Shinskey [1] was rightin that this advanced concept of controller–rejector needs tobe communicated to those at the front line of production; thehundred-fold improvement he observed in the past and the over50% energy saving obtained recently are testaments of the powerof such ideas, as do the applications summarized in [26]. To thisend, the centrality of disturbance rejection and the objective ofdisturbance-free control should be ﬁrmly established in all futureapplication researches. To answer the earlier question, these arethe ideas and ideals that should be “applied” in future research inautomatic control.References[1] Shinskey FG. Process control systems.

In this paper we formulate a strategy for developing mathematically consistent norms that do not support spurious growth of disturbance energy in the absence of ‘physical’ sources of energy. A critical analysis of various disturbance energy norms existing in literature is conducted and important conclusions regarding positive definitiveness and susceptibility to exhibiting unphysical growth are drawn. It is shown that the energy norm proposed by Cantrell and Hart [Interaction between sound and flow in acoustic cavities: mass, momentum and energy considerations, Journal of Acoustical Society of America 36 (1964) 697–706] and Myers' first order disturbance energy norm [Transport of energy by disturbances in arbitrary steady flow, Journal of Fluid Mechanics 226 (1991) 383–400] are positive definite if M0 &#60; 1 and M0 &#60; 1/&#8730;&#947;, respectively, where M0 is the magnitude of the local mean flow Mach number, &#947; is the ratio of specific heats at constant pressure and volume and the stipulated conditions should be met at every point in the flow domain. Our analysis shows that the disturbance energy norm proposed by Chu [On the energy transfer to small disturbances in fluid flow (part I), Acta Mechanica 1 (1965) 215–234] does not exhibit unphysical growth. It is also shown that this property is not unique to Chu's disturbance energy norm and there exists a family of norms which satisfy this requirement. The analysis also leads to an interesting interpretation of the acoustic energy conservation principle of Cantrell and Hart. The potential held by various disturbance energy norms for exhibiting fictitious growth is quantified using tools from nonmodal stability theory. It is concluded that if the mean flow Mach number is small, Myers' norm is a suitable measure of the disturbance energy",,"Article, PeerReviewed",T Technology (General),,Elsevier Science

The disturbances can be of narrow band type (simple or multiple) or of broad band type. A model can be associated to these disturbances. The knowledge of this model allows to design an appropriate control system in order to attenuate (or to reject) their effect upon the system to be controlled. The attenuation of disturbances by feedback is limited by the Bode Integral and the """"water bed"""" effect upon the output sensitivity function. In such situations the feedback approach has to be complemented by a """"feedforward disturbance compensation"""" requiring an additional transducer for gettinginformation upon the disturbance. Unfortunately in most of the situations the disturbances are unknown and time-varying and therefore an adaptive approach should be considered. The generic term for adaptive attenuation of unknown and timevarying disturbances is """"adaptive regulation"""" (known plant model, unknown and time-varying disturbance model). The paper will review a number of recent developments for adaptive feedback compensation of multiple unknown and timevarying narrowband disturbances and for adaptive feedforward compensation of broad band disturbances in the presence of the inherent internal positive feedback caused by the coupling between the compensator system and the measurement of the image of the disturbance.

disturbance hypothesis,103470818,Only noise can induce chaos in discrete populations,,,2016,"detect chaos in noisy ecological systems. One message of our paper is that if a dynamic model is available and if this model predicts chaotic behaviour, one should consider its discrete-state, noisy version when fitting numerical predictions to observations. We emphasize that deterministic discrete-state models behave periodically, thus only the interaction of these deterministic skeletons with random noise can produce non-regular dynamics. We detect and describe a relatively sharply defined range of the noise (the grey zone) where the gradual transition from periodic to chaotic behaviour happens. This zone, the upper border of which can be predicted analytically, is identified in experimental data as well as in numerical simulations. In the grey zone the global, statistical behaviour will approach the statistics produced by the chaotic, continuous model, and in this sense we claim that noise can produce chaos. There is growing interest in the chaotic behaviour of ecological systems ever since the seminal papers by Robert May (May 1974, 1976). However, the foolproof detection of chaos in ecological systems has remained a great challenge. While ecological systems are inherently noisy, data series are often short and unreliable.

disturbance hypothesis,267152964,Noise induced tipping in ocean circulation based on the Stommel model,,"Yin, Ziming",2018,"The Atlantic Ocean circulation transports the warmth and salinity northwards and it is a crucial part of the world climate. The flipping of this circulation is hypothesized to be the explanation of several abrupt climate changes over the past 2.6 million years. The pattern of this circulation can be determined from ocean models, and a typical pattern, which is also used in this thesis, is described by the Stommel model. There are two bifurcations in the Stommel model — one is a smooth bifurcation and the other is a non-smooth bifurcation. When the system approaches either bifurcation, the presence of noise makes the system escape from the current state easily. However, the properties of these two bifurcations are widely different. Here for the smooth bifurcation, the probability of tipping is judged by some well-known linear and nonlinear methods, including the linear decay rate, the potential energy and the skewness. Whereas for the non-smooth bifurcation, if there is no discernable trend from the above methods, we find out that one is also able to obtain the early warning signal by a unique feature of the Stommel model: the eigenvalues of the system matrix when approaching the non-smooth bifurcation are complex numbers, which lead to periodic circulations. The change of the periodic circulation can be observed by the variation of its power spectral density, which is important in showing the proximity to tipping. In this thesis, the coherence resonance is used to define this variation. After some extensive studies, we find that the combination of the above methods are able to give us an early warning signal as the system moves closer to the bifurcations.Science, Faculty ofMathematics, Department ofGraduat",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/Text, Thesis/Dissertation",,,University of British Columbia

In contrast to this idea, our detailed landscape surveys show that disturbances happen most frequently in sub regions of the bed that support the greatest productivity and hence thickest cover of Mytilus californianus. Crowding reduces the attachment strength of mussels, making them more susceptible to dislodgment, and also lowers the reproductive condition of those imbedded individuals. A layer of empty shells and debris develops above the rock surface, barring direct rock attachment and promoting lateral attachments in the surface layers. This structurally unstable aggregation with thickened layers incurs more frequent propagating gaps than thinner layers.

The periodic motion in which there is the existence of a restoring force and the body moves along the same path to and fro about a definite point called equilibrium position/mean position is called oscillatory motion. The oscillatory motion could be either linear oscillation or circular oscillation. For example, the oscillation of strings of musical instruments is linear oscillation whilst the oscillation of the simple pendulum of a clock is circular oscillation. A wave is a correlated collection of oscillations. For example, in a wave traveling along a string, each point in the string oscillates back and forth in the transverse direction (perpendicular to the direction of the string); in sound waves, each air molecule oscillates back and forth in the longitudinal direction (the direction in which the sound is traveling). Therefore understanding oscillatory motions is the basis of understanding waves. Oscillatory motions and wave-like patterns are common in time series data as well. For example, the number of infected cases of a disease in epidemiology; species migration in ecology, human blood sugar or blood pressure levels in biology; the harvest of crops in agriculture; behavior of consumer price index in economics; share returns in finance; the number of arrivals to a cultural landscape in tourism management, etc. follow regular or irregular wave-like patterns. The Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), Circular Model (CM), and Sama Circular Model (SCM) were successful in modeling such series. The literature revealed that the daily infected cases of Covid 19 show irregular wave-like patterns with; increasing amplitudes, decreasing amplitudes, or both, but none of the existing time series forecasting techniques are capable of capturing them. The pattern of these series is somewhat similar to the pattern of Damped oscillation and Forced oscillation described in Physics.  Hence the authors of the study intended to develop suitable forecasting techniques to model such time series and developed two new stochastic models named; Damped Circular Model (DCM)  and Forced Circular Model (FCM). The development of the models was based on the Circular model (which was based on Simple harmonic motion), the theory of Damped and Forced Oscillations, and the Second-order Differential Equations.

We find that time delay, noise sources and their correlation induce regime shifts and transitions between the population survival state and the extinction state. To explore the transition mechanism between these two states, we analyzed the shift time to extinction, or the delayed extinction time, of populations. The main finding is that the extinction transition time as a function of the noise intensity shows a maximum, indicating the existence of an appropriate noise intensity leading to a maximal delayed extinction. This nonmonotonic behavior, with a maximum, is a signature of the noise-enhanced stability phenomenon, observed in many physical and complex metastable systems. In particular, this maximum increases (or decreases) as the cross-correlation intensity or the delay time in the death process increases. Furthermore, the signal-to-noise ratio as a function of noise intensity shows a maximum, which is a signature of the stochastic resonance phenomenon in the population dynamics model investigated in the presence of time delay and environmental noise",,Text,,,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC'

One possible explanation could be a discrete change in attractor orientation due to external disturbance.

Displacement along the fault is represented by the movement of a spring-block model, whereby the uniform and oscillatory motion correspond to the fault dynamics in post-seismic and inter-seismic creep regime, respectively. The effect of the external force is introduced as a change of block acceleration in the form of a sine wave scaled by an exponential pulse. Model dynamics is examined for variable parameters of the induced acceleration changes in reference to periodic oscillations of the unperturbed system above the supercritical Hopf bifurcation curve. The analysis indicates the occurrence of weak irregular oscillations if external force acts in the post-seismic creep regime. When fault motion is exposed to external force in the inter-seismic creep regime, one finds the transition to quasiperiodic- or chaos-like motion, which we attribute to the precursory creep regime and seismic motion, respectively.

disturbance hypothesis,529667639,Disturbance decreases genotypic diversity by reducing colonization: Implications for disturbance-diversity feedbacks.,,"Kollars, Nicole M, Stachowicz, John J",2022,"One objective of eco-evolutionary dynamics is to understand how the interplay between ecology and evolution on contemporary timescales contributes to the maintenance of biodiversity. Disturbance is an ecological process that can alter species diversity through both ecological and evolutionary effects on colonization and extinction dynamics. While analogous mechanisms likely operate among genotypes within a population, empirical evidence demonstrating the relationship between disturbance and genotypic diversity remains limited. We experimentally tested how disturbance altered the colonization (gain) and extinction (loss) of genets within a population of the marine angiosperm Zostera marina (eelgrass). In a 2-year field experiment conducted in northern California, we mimicked grazing disturbance by migratory geese by clipping leaves at varying frequencies during the winter months. Surprisingly, we found the greatest rates of new colonization in the absence of disturbance and that clipping had negligible effects on extinction. We hypothesize that genet extinction was not driven by selective mortality from clipping or from any stochastic loss resulting from the reduced shoot densities in clipped plots. We also hypothesize that increased flowering effort and facilitation within and among clones drove the increased colonization of new genets in the undisturbed treatment. This balance between colonization and extinction resulted in a negative relationship between clipping frequency and net changes in genotypic richness. We interpret our results in light of prior work showing that genotypic diversity increased resistance to grazing disturbance. We suggest that both directions of a feedback between disturbance and diversity occur in this system with consequences for the maintenance of eelgrass genotypic diversity",,article,"Zosteraceae, Ecosystem, Biodiversity, Genotype, Feedback, California, Herbivory, colonization, disturbance, eelgrass, feedback, genotypic diversity, grazing, Life Below Water, Life on Land, Ecological Applications, Ecology, Evolutionary Biology",,"eScholarship, University of California"
disturbance hypothesis,586765343,Long-term disturbance ecology,,"Tinner, Willy",2023,"Study object and approaches  Disturbance is a short-lasting event or a series of distinct brief events (lasting hours to days) that alter vegetation or ecosystem conditions, potentially releasing ecological and environmental trajectories that may continue over decades to centuries. Natural disturbance agents might be fire, browsing, pests, wind, frost, heat, floods, volcanic eruptions, avalanches, landslides or rockfalls. Some disturbances such as fire and browsing might be prevalently caused by human impact. Climate-change impacts act at different temporal scales and are thus usually not considered as disturbances. Indeed climate change is defined by a series of weather conditions over decades (>30 years) and deals more with averages (e.g. mean July temperatures, mean annual temperatures) than extremes or singularities (IPCC, 2013), which are characteristic for disturbance. Palaeoecological climate-impact studies thus usually have multi-decadal temporal resolutions, while disturbance- impact studies should possess decadal resolutions, ideally 5-10 years (Birks, 1997b). The higher temporal resolution needed for the reconstruction of disturbance ecology from sedimentary records is explained by short-lived processes that might be overlooked if resolutions are coarser than c. 10 years. For instance, a fire event may release widespread successional trajectories involving intermediate community stages, as observed in Yellowstone National Park in 1988 (Whitlock and Millspaugh, 1996). In the case of non-contiguous sampling, missing the one sample or year containing the disturbance signal (e.g. fire) may mean failing to attribute the resulting vegetational pattern to the right forcing. Moreover, having resolutions coarser than 10 years may result in a dilution of the disturbance signal (and thus its gradual loss) and/or the non-recognition of short-lived terrestrial plants (e.g. expansions of Epilobium angustifolium, Anemone, Mentha, Urtica, Cichorioideae, Poaceae, Rosaceae) or fungi such as Sporormiella (Tinner et al., 1999, 2008; Gobet et al., 2003; Schwörer et al., 2015).

In this paper, we show that Chu's disturbance energy defines an inner product, with respect to which the conservation equations of fluid motion linearized about a uniform base flow are self-adjoint. This ensures that the eigenvectors of the linearized operator are orthogonal to each other, and the property that the energy norm is a non-increasing function of time in the absence of physical sources of energy follows as an immediate consequence. Examples from numerical simulations of Euler equations are presented to highlight the importance of choosing an energy norm that is consistent with the underlying physics. We demonstrate that the disturbance energy as measured by Chu's norm does not exhibit spurious transient growth in the absence of physical sources of energy and hence is suitable for analyzing thermoacoustic instability",,"Article, PeerReviewed",T Technology (General),,Elsevier Science

Human disturbances can elicit flight responses in wildlife (Stankowich 2008), which are often energetically costly and may have additional costs such as a loss of for-aging time (Houston et al. 2012) or reduced intake rate (Rutten et al. 2010). If individuals are unable to compen-sate for the costs of disturbance, this can lead to deterio-rating body condition (Amo et al. 2006), lower survival probabilities (Blanc et al. 2006, Goss-Custard et al. 2006), reduced reproduction (White and Thurow 1985) and thus lower fitness. Individual variation in disturbance vulner-ability (i.e. the likelihood that disturbance will reduce an individual’s fitness) can alter the effects of disturbance on wildlife populations. In populations where individu-als vary in their disturbance vulnerability, the most vul-nerable individuals are expected to suffer higher energetic losses when disturbance occurs and their condition may be affected even under low levels of disturbance (Rodríguez-Prieto et al. 2010, Griffin et al. 2017).The conventional way of thinking about how individuals can vary in their disturbance vulnerability is through varia-tion in their disturbance sensitivity, determining how strong they respond to disturbance (‘disturbance sensitivity hypoth-esis’ in Fig. 1). In experimental settings individuals differ con-sistently in their response to stressful stimuli that resemble disturbances, for example individual chaffinches showed consistent responses to model hawks (Quinn and Cresswell 2005). In the field, individual consistency in disturbance responses (often measured as the consistency in flight initia-tion distances) is also observed, but the extent varies strongly among species (Thiel et al. 2007, Ellenberg et al. 2009, Carrete and Tella 2013, DeVault et al. 2017). Individual variation in disturbance responses can be caused by per-sonality (Ellenberg et al. 2009) and sex (Thiel et al. 2007, Ellenberg et al. 2009), but can also arise due to habitua-tion (Runyan and Blumstein 2004, Ellenberg et al. 2009, Rodríguez-Prieto et al. 2010).We propose a second pathway via which individual varia-tion can affect how vulnerable individuals are to disturbance: differences in their ability to compensate for disturbance, for example by increasing foraging time (Urfi et al. 1996, Blanc et al. 2006, Houston et al. 2012), may also cause individual variation in disturbance vulnerability, even when disturbance responses are similar. In many populations, indi-viduals differ in their foraging time budgets and thus in how time-limited they are (Pelletier and Festa-Bianchet 2004, Hamel and Côté 2008, Daunt et al. 2014, van der Kolk et al. 2020a). Time budget differences often arise from individ-ual variation in foraging efficiency (Stillman et al. 2000, Cresswell et al. 2001, Lescroël et al. 2010). We hypothesize that time-limited individuals are less able to cope with distur-bance than others since they have limited time to compensate for disturbance (‘time-limitation hypothesis’ in Fig. 1). Previous studies have shown that disturbance at foraging grounds has a larger predicted impact than disturbance out-side foraging grounds, when animals could more easily com-pensate for disturbance costs (Pirotta et al. 2019). However, no studies have explicitly quantified how disturbance costs differ among individuals that vary in their time budgets.If for time-limited individuals their condition is more likely to deteriorate upon disturbance, then individual variation in time budgets is important to consider when quantifying disturbance impacts on a population. Many models have been developed to quantify disturbance impacts, ranging from relatively simple analytical models Figure 1. Proposed pathways via which variation among individuals in mean foraging time can affect how disturbance impacts condi-tion. Green continuous arrows and red dashed arrows indicate posi-tive and negative relationships, respectively. Four hypotheses discussed in the main text on how individual differences can alter disturbance impacts are marked inside grey boxes. The ‘risk-distur-bance hypothesis’ and ‘escape ability hypothesis’ are explained in the discussion. Note that for simplicity, not all processes influencing disturbance responses (e.g. habituation) are included in the figure, as such processes are expected to be additive and not altering the hypothesized mechanisms.639(Houston et al. 2012), to complex individual-based mod-els (Stillman and Goss-Custard 2010). Several modelling frameworks would allow to explore how individual varia-tion could affect estimates of population impacts of dis-turbance (Stillman and Goss-Custard 2010, Pirotta et al. 2018), but no study has done this explicitly. A challenge therefore is to develop and parameterize such models with empirical data, in order to quantitatively assess the impact of individual variation in time budgets and thereby evalu-ate the importance of including such heterogeneity in pop-ulation models.Eurasian oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus are a rel-evant model system to study the time-limitation hypothesis, as individuals vary greatly in their foraging efficiency (Goss-Custard and Durell 1983, Caldow et al. 1999) and foraging time (van der Kolk et al. 2020a), while they are strongly time constrained by the limited accessibility of intertidal feeding grounds (Zwarts et al. 1996). In fact, the average foraging time of an individual oystercatcher can be interpreted as a measure of the effort required to meet their energy require-ments, and thus as a measure of how time-limited an individ-ual is. Oystercatchers that forage on average shorter (‘efficient foragers’; Glossary of terms used in Supporting information) forage likely more efficiently or have lower energetic costs. In support, individuals that forage shorter have a higher appar-ent winter survival in comparison to inefficient individuals that forage on average longer (van der Kolk et al. 2020a). Another reason why oystercatchers are a relevant model system is that they live in coastal areas that are also heavily utilized for a wide range of human activities that cause fre-quent disturbance (van der Kolk et al. 2020b). Disturbance is one of the potential causes of the current decline of the oystercatcher population that is insufficiently studied (van de Pol et al. 2014).Here, we illustrate the potential implications of our time-limitation hypothesis by empirically and mathemati-cally studying whether and how time-limited individuals are differently affected by disturbance than less time-limited individuals. We first use GPS-tracking of oystercatchers to assess individual variation in immediate flight responses and foraging time losses following three different disturbances by transport airplanes, which are rare but elicit strong flight responses (van der Kolk et al. 2020b). We test whether an individual’s average foraging time in undisturbed tidal peri-ods (a measure for how efficient individuals are) affects addi-tional flight time and foraging time loss in disturbed tidal period. Next, we tested whether individuals compensated for disturbance costs in tidal periods following the disturbance. We then expanded and parameterized the analytical model developed by Houston et al. (2012), which predicts the maxi-mum time animals can be disturbed while still meeting their energy requirements. We used the model to quantify distur-bance thresholds for individuals that vary in their time bud-get, and illustrate how such variation could affect population impacts of disturbance for wintering oystercatchers, consid-ering the observed distribution of average foraging times in the population at our study site.MethodsStudy systemOystercatchers are long-lived shorebirds that winter in large numbers in the Wadden Sea. They forage on intertidal flats on shellfish (e.g. Cerastoderma edule and Mytilus edulis) and soft-bodied prey (e.g. Polychaeta) during low tide. During high tide, birds roost or can forage on alternative feeding areas where intake rates are lower, for example inland fields (Goss-Custard and Durell 1983). Most individuals show high site fidelity and return each winter to the same site. Most birds arrive in the winter areas in July and depart to the breeding areas in February.The field study was conducted during the non-breeding season in the western Dutch Wadden Sea, on the barrier island Vlieland. The western half of the island is used as a mil-itary air force training area. Jets, helicopters and small civil airplanes frequently occur in the study area, but their distur-bance impact is normally low, eliciting no or relatively short flight responses. In contrast, low-flying transport airplanes occur rarely (three times per year in 2017–2019) but evoke strong flight responses likely because of their exceptionally large size, even when the transport airplane flies far away (10 km) from the birds (van der Kolk et al. 2020b).Data collectionOystercatcher GPS dataTidal foraging time and flight time of oystercatchers was quantified using solar powered UvA-BiTS GPS trackers (Bouten et al. 2013). Forty oystercatchers were equipped with GPS trackers on the Vliehors (53°23'N, 04°93'E): twenty non-local breeders were caught with mist nets in winter (December 2016–January 2017) and 20 local breeders were caught on the nest (May–July 2017). GPS fixes were taken in 5- or 60-min intervals and a 0.35 s sample (seven measure-ments) of a 20 Hz tri-axial accelerometer was taken at least every 10 min. We used a training dataset containing anno-tated accelerometer samples to train a Random Forest model (Breiman 2001) to classify foraging, flying and other (inac-tive and preening) behaviour (details in van der Kolk et al. 2020a). Using an independent testing dataset with 8178 samples, we confirmed the high prediction accuracy of the Random Forest model (precision: forage 98%, fly 98%, other 100%; recall: forage 99%, fly 95%, other 99%; Supporting information).Aircraft and environmental dataTimings of transport airplane exercises were provided by the Royal Netherlands Air Force. The exact times when mini-mum and maximum water levels occurred at low and high tide, respectively, and water heights for every 10 min were provided for Vlieland harbour (53°29'5''N, 05°09'1''E) by Rijkswaterstaat (2019). A tidal period was defined as the period between two consecutive high tide maxima at Vlieland harbour (Rijkswaterstaat 2019). Each tidal period 640thus included a single low tide and was approximately 12.4 h long. Timings of sunrise and sunset were obtained via the sunrise.set function in the StreamMetabolism package in R. Daily moon illumination values were obtained via the lunar.illumination function in the lunar package in R.Empirical study: individual variation in additional flight time and foraging time lossData of GPS-tagged oystercatchers were used to empirically study how individuals (which varied in their average forag-ing time in undisturbed tidal periods) altered flight time and foraging time in response to disturbances. We first compared flight time and foraging time between disturbed tidal periods and undisturbed tidal periods. We then quantified whether individuals compensated for costs of disturbance by increas-ing their foraging time in subsequent tidal periods. All analy-ses were performed in R ver. 3.5.3 (<www.r-project.org>).We studied three disturbed tidal periods on 9, 10 and 16 August 2017 (henceforth event 1, 2 and 3 respectively) with large disturbances by one Lockheed C-130 Hercules trans-port aircraft. The aircraft entered the study area 3, 5 and 6.5 h before low tide, respectively, and circled for approximately one hour in the study area (Supporting information). During the first two disturbance events, all GPS tagged oystercatch-ers present on the Vliehors were disturbed (i.e. took flight), whereas during the third event a subset of the birds were disturbed, which we confirmed by visual inspection of the GPS data. We collected data from 18 individuals during all three disturbed tidal periods, three individuals during two disturbed tidal periods and one individual during one dis-turbed tidal period (nbird = 22, nbird-disturbance = 61; Supporting information). Data from another 18 oystercatchers was not available because the tracker malfunctioned, the individual had died or the individual was outside the study area.Tidal time budgets: flight time and foraging timeThe total time spent flying, foraging or other behaviour was quantified for each bird for each tidal period. First, each annotated accelerometer measurement within a tidal period was weighed based on the time interval until the next anno-tated accelerometer measurement. This time interval was typ-ically ten minutes, the default interval at which GPS trackers took accelerometer measurements, but sometimes longer if an accelerometer measurement was interrupted and could not be annotated. The time intervals from all annotated flight behaviours or annotated foraging behaviours within one tidal period were then summed to acquire the total tidal flight time or tidal foraging time in hours, respectively. To ensure sufficient accuracy, tidal flight and foraging time estimates were omitted if there were less than 70 behavioural measure-ments or if the maximum interval exceeded 20 min (van der Kolk et al. 2020a for more details).Average foraging timeThe average foraging time in undisturbed tidal periods and standard error was calculated for each individual over the whole winter season (1 August 2017–31 March 2018). The tidal foraging time of 17 out of 22 individuals was measured during at least 100 tidal periods in this period (Supporting information). We used the average foraging time as explana-tory variable in statistical models estimating the effect of dis-turbance on flight time and foraging time.Effects of disturbance on flight time and foraging timeLinear mixed effects models were used to analyse the effect of disturbance on tidal flight time and tidal foraging time. Tidal flight time and tidal foraging time between 1 August 2017 and 15 September 2017 were used as response variables. The model structure consisted of two parts (Eq. 1): 1) variables controlling for environmental conditions were estimated for all tidal periods. 2) Variables that were only estimated for dis-turbed tidal periods (the last part in Eq. 1 between paren-theses). This structure was needed since we included average foraging time as explanatory variable for changes in flight or foraging time in disturbed tidal periods, but not for undis-turbed tidal periods. Equation 1 shows the fixed structure of the model (for simplicity random effects are only described in the text).b b b b b b bb b b b b0 1 2 3 4 5 1 6 27 3 8 1 9 2 10 3+ + + + + ´ ++ + + + +N M NM A D E EE E F E F E F(11B)  (1)whereβ0–β11 = parameters estimated by the modelN = proportion of night-time (time between sunset and sunrise)M = proportion of moon visibility (0 = new moon, 1 = full moon)A = proportion of time water levels is below −10 cm Amsterdam Ordnance Datum and tidal flats are accessible for feedingD = binary variable indicating whether it is a disturbed tidal periodE1–E3 = binary variables indicating whether tidal period is disturbance event number 1, 2 or 3F = average foraging time of an individual in undisturbed tidal periodsB = binary variable indicating whether an individual is a local breederFor the first part of the model controlling for environ-mental conditions, the interaction between night (N) and moon stage (M) and intertidal flat accessibility (A) were used as explanatory variables (all mean-centred). Those tidal char-acteristics are important determinants of tidal foraging time (van der Kolk et al. 2020a) and were included in the model as confounding factors that affect flight time and foraging time. Bird individual was added as random intercept, and random slopes of night, moon stage and intertidal flat accessibility were fitted for individual birds as well, since individuals differ in how much foraging time is allocated to tidal periods with different environmental characteristics (e.g. some individuals 641allocate more foraging time to day-time tidal periods than others; van der Kolk et al. 2020a).For the second part of the model, a binary variable (D) was introduced such that the following variables were only estimated for disturbed tidal periods. For each of the three disturbance events (E1–E3), the disturbance effect in interac-tion with average foraging time (F; individual mean centred) was estimated. We expected that birds that had been breeding locally may respond less, given that they frequently encounter aircraft also in the breeding season. Breeding location of each individual was therefore included as an additional explana-tory binary variable (B; local breeder in study area, n = 14 birds; non-local breeder, n = 8 birds; Supporting informa-tion) for all disturbed tidal periods. We checked whether increased flight time and foraging time loss in disturbed tidal periods were affected by the distance at which birds were positioned from the centre of the military training area prior to disturbance by including it as an additional fixed effect in the disturbance part of the model. Since this effect was non-significant, this variable was not retained in the final models. We used the nlme function in R to estimate all twelve param-eter values (β0–β11) in the model. Visual inspection confirmed that the residuals of both models approximated a normal dis-tribution (Supporting information).To explore whether uncertainty in the average foraging time estimates affected the model estimates, we used boot-strapping to identify 95% confidence intervals of model esti-mates and p-values, by extracting average foraging times for each individual from a normal distribution based on their means and standard error (n = 1000 iterations). We confirmed by visual inspection that foraging time estimates within indi-viduals approached normal distributions. All parameters were robust to the uncertainty in individual average foraging times, except for the fixed slope of average foraging time on flight time during the 2nd disturbed tidal period (Supporting information). The interpretation of our results did, however, not depend on this one parameter being significant or not.To quantify how consistent individuals’ responses to distur-bance were, ‘additional flight time’ (actual flight time minus expected flight time without disturbance) and ‘foraging time loss’ were calculated (expected foraging time minus actual foraging time). Expected flight and foraging times were pre-dicted using only the estimates of the environmental variables in the models, reflecting flight and foraging times expected under these environmental conditions without any effect of disturbance. We then used additional flight time and foraging time loss as response variables in linear mixed models, includ-ing event number (1, 2 or 3) as explanatory factor and bird individual as random intercept. The proportion of variation explained by bird individual was calculated using the intra-class correlation coefficient (Nakagawa and Schielzeth 2010). We tested whether there was a (Pearson) correlation between additional flight time and foraging time loss.Foraging time compensation after disturbanceWe analysed whether birds compensated for disturbance by increasing their foraging time in tidal periods following disturbed tidal periods. Additionally, we analysed whether an increase in foraging time was related to the costs of dis-turbance. For this purpose, we first calculated change in foraging time for these compensatory tidal periods (actual foraging time minus expected foraging time). The predicted required foraging time to compensate for disturbance (i.e. the total disturbance costs) was then calculated for each bird for each disturbed tidal period based on foraging time loss and the predicted foraging time required to compensate for flight costs:For ForFly FlyDEEForcomp losstime costday=´  (2)Forcomp = change in foraging time required to compensate for disturbance costs (h)Forloss = foraging time loss in disturbed tidal period (h)Flytime = additional flight time in disturbed tidal period (h)Flycost = energetic costs of flight (kJ h−1)DEE = daily energy expenditure (kJ)Forday = daily foraging time of an individual (h)To estimate the foraging time needed to compensate for flight costs, we assumed that flight costs (Flycost) were 135 kJ h−1 and daily energy expenditure (DEE) 734 kJ for all birds (Zwarts et al. 1996, Pennycuick 2008). We weighted flight costs by how efficient individuals acquired energy. Hence, flight costs were divided by the estimated individual foraging efficiency in kJ h−1 by dividing daily energy expenditure by the daily foraging time (where daily foraging time is twice the average tidal foraging time, provided that every day has approximately two tidal periods).We used linear mixed models to determine whether change in foraging time in compensatory tidal periods was related to the required foraging time to compensate for disturbance costs. An interaction between disturbance event and required foraging time was added to the model. Bird identity was included as random intercept. We used two separate models to analyse compensation at two temporal scales: one and six tidal periods (roughly half a day and three days, respectively) following the disturbed tidal period. Since events 1 and 2 occurred on consecutive days, we merged their data for the analysis over six tidal periods.Mathematical modelling of disturbance costs as a function of foraging timeWe expanded the general analytical model developed by Houston et al. (2012) to assess how disturbance impacts the energy and time budget of individuals that vary in their for-aging efficiency. The model of Houston et al. (2012) predicts the time an animal needs to forage in order to balance its energy budget over one day, while it is disturbed while forag-ing. From their model disturbance thresholds can be derived above which an animal cannot compensate for disturbance anymore and its condition will deteriorate. We modified 642the model of Houston et al. in two ways. First, we explicitly divided the time budget into time during which an animal can forage and time that is not available for foraging. This allowed us to estimate disturbance thresholds for animals for which foraging time is restricted, for example by daylight or tidal patterns. Second, we modelled disturbance as a fixed duration instead of a proportion of the foraging time, to reflect that individuals can be disturbed independently of their behaviour. We do differentiate between disturbance during time when animals can forage (e.g. low tide) and time not available for foraging (e.g. high tide). This is nec-essary since only disturbance during available foraging time limits the potential maximum amount of time that can be spent foraging. Overall, our expansion of the Houston et al. model allowed us to investigate the differential compensation potential to disturbance in time-limited individuals and con-sequently quantify how individual variation in time budgets affects the proportion of the population in which condition may deteriorate.In our model, the energy budget is balanced over a cer-tain period (T), for example one day or one tidal period. The model aim is to find the balance between the foraging time required to fulfil energy needs and the potentially available foraging time. The required foraging time depends on total energy requirements and foraging energy intake rate:FRgreq=   (3)Freq = time that needs to be spend foraging to meet energy requirements (h)R = total energy requirements (kJ)g = foraging energy intake rate (kJ h−1)The energy requirements are determined by an individual’s normal energy expenditure and additional costs due to dis-turbance. Disturbance can take place during time that is available for foraging (DF) or during non-foraging time (DN), and both cause increased energy expenditure:R T D D E D D EF N m F N d= - -( )´ + +( )´   (4)T = time over which energy budget is balanced (h)DF = time disturbed during time that is available for foraging (h)DN = time disturbed during non-foraging time (h)Em = average energy expenditure throughout T (kJ h−1)Ed = energy expenditure during disturbance (kJ h−1)The potential foraging time Fpot is determined by the maximum time that can be spent foraging (e.g. the dura-tion of low tide) and the reduction of that time due to disturbance (DF):F F DFpot max= -   (5)Fmax = Maximum available foraging time when there is no dis-turbance (h)By comparing Freq and Fpot it can be predicted whether an individual can forage sufficiently to meet its energy require-ments, or whether it has a foraging time shortage leading to a reduced condition:if Sufficient uptake to meetenergy requirempot req real reqF F F F³ =:ents  (6)if Insufficient uptake and atrisk of conditipot req real potF F F F< =:on deteriorationFreal = actual (realized) foraging timeFrom Eq. 3–6, we derived formulas of disturbance thresholds, for DF (DF_crit, assuming DN = 0 h, Eq. S7 in the Supporting information), for DN (DN_crit, assuming DF = 0 h, Eq. S8 in the Supporting information) and for DF and DN combined (Dcrit, assuming DF = DN, Eq. S9 in the Supporting information). These disturbance thresholds represent the maximum duration of disturbance at which an individual can still fulfil its energy requirements (see the Supporting information for a more comprehensive model description).The model is generally relevant for any species in which the available foraging time is restricted, but we parameterized and applied the model to wintering oystercatchers to pre-dict disturbance thresholds and energetic losses due to dis-turbance. In the model, oystercatchers balance their energy requirements over one tidal period (T = 12.4 h), of which only the low tide period could be spent foraging (Fmax = 6.5 h). Mean energy expenditure (Em = 30.6 kJ h−1) was derived from daily energy expenditure for an individual with a body mass of 550 g (Zwarts et al. 1996). During disturbance, birds typically take flight but also spend time being vigilant, which may not be energetically costly but further reduces the avail-able foraging time. Energy expenditure during disturbance (Ed) was therefore composed of flight costs (Ef = 135 kJ h−1; Pennycuick 2008) multiplied by the proportion of disturbed time spent in flight (f = 0.333, Collop et al. 2016), and ener-getic costs of being vigilant (Ev) multiplied by the proportion of time spent vigilant while disturbed (Eq. 7). For oyster-catchers we lack data on the energetic cost of being vigilant and therefore assumed that Ev = Em, as vigilance behaviour requires no additional physical activity.E f E f Ed f v= ´ + -( )´1   (7)To explore the consequences of disturbance for individuals with different foraging times, we assumed a linear relation-ship between the foraging energy intake rate g and the average foraging time of an individual. For individuals that ranged in their foraging time from 3.0–6.5 h per tidal period (equiva-lent to g= 58–126 kJ h−1 when assuming Em = 30.6 kJ h−1 643and T = 12.4 h), we derived disturbance thresholds for low tide disturbance, high tide disturbance and combined low and high tide disturbance. To assess impacts of disturbance on individuals with varying time budgets, we calculated the realized foraging times (Freal) in one tidal period under six disturbance scenarios: one, two or three hours of disturbance during either low tide or high tide. If birds were unable to fulfil their energy requirements, we calculated the energetic loss (Eloss) in one tidal period (Supporting information).Finally, we used the observed distribution of foraging times of wintering oystercatchers at our study site to illustrate how variation in time budgets could impact the effect of distur-bance on a population. We used GPS data to determine aver-age foraging times of 85 individuals between 2016 and 2019 (Supporting information and van der Kolk et al. 2020a). We estimated the proportion of the population for which condi-tion may deteriorate as a function of disturbance duration (in h per tidal period), by comparing disturbance levels with the population distribution of critical disturbance thresholds (Dcrit). This assumes that imposed disturbance levels reflect the average disturbance level over an extended period. To show how populations can be differentially impacted by het-erogeneity in time budget, we repeated the calculations for simulated populations in which we increased or decreased the amount of observed individual variability in average foraging time by 10%.ResultsEmpirical flight and foraging time responses to disturbanceIndividual differences in disturbance responsesDisturbance by transport airplanes caused an increase in tidal flight time and a reduction in tidal foraging time. Flight time increased on average more than half an hour in the first two disturbed tidal periods and by about 15 min in the third dis-turbed tidal period (Fig. 2a, Table 1). Foraging time was on average significantly reduced by 1.7 h and 1.3 h in the first Figure 2. Additional flight time (a–b) and foraging time loss (c–d) in disturbed tidal periods compared to undisturbed tidal periods. In (a) and (c) the responses during each event are depicted, where dots from the same individual are connected and the black dots and error bars represent the means and 95% confidence intervals. In (b) and (d) the relationships between the average foraging time of an individual and additional flight time or foraging time loss for the three disturbed tidal periods are depicted. Values above zero indicate birds flew more (a–b) or lost more foraging time (c–d) than expected based on environmental conditions. Twenty-two individuals were measured, of which three were measured during two events and one during one event (nbird-disturbance = 61). Regression lines in (b) and (d) are derived from the model in Table 1.644and second disturbed tidal period, respectively, but was not significantly affected in the third disturbed tidal period when the disturbance occurred earlier in the tidal period around high tide (Fig. 2c, Table 1). There was a positive correla-tion between additional flight time and foraging time loss (r = 0.27, p = 0.038, n = 61; Supporting information).Individual differences accounted for a substantial propor-tion of the variation in response to disturbance. After correct-ing for the tidal period, bird identity accounted for 35.8% and 35.2% of the variation in additional flight time and for-aging time loss, respectively (Fig. 2; Supporting information). This was significantly higher than what would be expected when randomly assigning Bird IDs to additional flight time (95% CI: 0–24.3%, 5000 iterations) and foraging time loss (95% CI: 0–23.5%, 5000 iterations).Inefficient foragers increased their flight time less in the first disturbed tidal period, but not in the second and third disturbed tidal periods, compared to efficient individuals that foraged on average shorter (Table 1, Fig. 2b). Contrary to our expectations, individuals that had been breeding locally increased flight time more than non-local breeders (Table 1).In support of the time-limitation hypothesis, foraging time loss in disturbed tidal periods was significantly larger for inef-ficient foragers (Table 1, Fig. 2d). Foraging time losses in dis-turbed tidal periods one and two increased with respectively 1.19 h and 1.18 h for individuals that foraged on average 1 h longer in undisturbed tidal periods (Table 1, Fig. 2d). During these disturbed tidal periods, inefficient foragers lost foraging time at the start of the tidal period and did not compensate for that later in the tidal period (Fig. 3). Efficient foragers did lose no or little foraging time, since also under normal condi-tions they would not have started foraging yet. During the third event, the disturbance took place well before the start of the low tide (Fig. 3) and consequently foraging time losses were not apparent and not significantly related to the average foraging time (Fig. 2d).Foraging time compensation after disturbanceChange in foraging time in the tidal period following the disturbed tidal period was positively related to the required foraging time to compensate for disturbance (Fig. 4a; Supporting information). Thus, individuals who experienced larger costs of disturbance lengthened their foraging time more than individuals for which costs of disturbance had been less. Notwithstanding, foraging time increased little in tidal periods following events 1 and 2 and was according to our calculations insufficient to compensate for the costs of disturbance.Over a longer time span of three days, after disturbance events 1 and 2 individuals did not significantly increasing their foraging time (Fig. 4b; Supporting information). Only following event 3, birds increased their foraging time suffi-ciently to compensate for the costs of disturbance (Fig. 4). It is important to note that after event 3 less compensation was required, as the costs of disturbance were relatively low compared to events 1 and 2 (Fig. 4).Mathematical modelling of disturbance costs as a function of foraging timeUsing our analytical model parameterized with field and lit-erature data from our model species, we explored disturbance thresholds, energetic costs and potential population conse-quences of disturbance for varying amounts of individual Table 1.

Efficient foragers had a higher dis-turbance threshold, particularly when disturbance occurred during high tide, as then disturbance does not limit available foraging time (Fig. 5a). If individuals cannot compensate for disturbance, it is expected that they maximize their foraging time (Fig. 5b). A lack of time to compensate for disturbance (i.e. when individuals cannot further increase their foraging time) may explain why we did not find a clear increased for-aging time in the field across all individuals following dis-turbance events 1 and 2, when the costs of disturbance were largest. In the model, inefficient foragers lost energy under most disturbance scenarios, whereas efficient foragers were able to deal with higher levels of disturbance without ener-getic losses (Fig. 5c).Using average foraging time estimates of 85 GPS-tracked individuals (Fig. 6a), our model estimated that a typical win-tering oystercatcher could compensate for 2.4 h disturbance per tidal period, assuming that disturbance pressure is simi-lar during high and low tide. The large individual variation (SD = 0.70 h), however, implies that some individuals can only compensate for low levels of disturbance (Fig. 6b). When oystercatchers are disturbed for half an hour in each tidal period, the model predicted that 0.27% of the popula-tion would not be able to compensate for disturbance and was at risk that their condition would deteriorate. To illus-trate that small changes in the distribution of the popula-tion affect this estimate, Fig. 6c shows that the part of the population at risk was more than halved (0.10%) or doubled (0.53%) when individual variation in average foraging time would be 10% smaller or larger, respectively.DiscussionOur field study shows that upon disturbance inefficient for-agers lose most foraging time. Using an analytical model, we further show how inefficient foragers may lack the time to compensate for disturbance. Consequently, these results Figure 3. Illustrative time budgets, cumulative flight time and cumulative foraging time for an example efficient (a, c, d) and inefficient (b, e, f ) individual. (a) and (b) show time budgets from 1 August 2017 to 31 August 2017 with flying, foraging and inactive (including preen-ing) behaviour. In (c–f ), disturbed tides are plotted together with undisturbed tides (tidal periods two days before (events 1 and 2) or one day before (event 3) the disturbed tidal periods) for comparison for visual reasons only. The moments of disturbance are indicated with arrows in (a–b) and with bars in the bottom of the plots in (c–f ). In (a–b) note that foraging is synchronized with the timing of low tide that shifts each day due to the lunar cycle.646support our newly proposed hypothesis that time-limited individuals are more likely to experience negative conse-quences from disturbance (e.g. condition reduction due to reduced food intake). Ultimately, variation in how time-lim-ited individuals are can affect the proportion of the popula-tion that is at risk from their condition deteriorating upon disturbance. In combination, these empirical and analytical results support the biological relevance of the time-limitation hypothesis and thereby offer a novel perspective on the causes and consequences of individual variation in vulnerability to disturbance. We discuss how our hypothesis is complemen-tary to prevailing ideas by exploring 1) the mechanisms that determine individual differences in vulnerability to distur-bance, 2) potential feedback loops between an individual’s condition and its response to disturbance that can alter indi-vidual vulnerability to disturbance and 3) the implications of our findings for population studies.Individual variation in vulnerability to disturbanceIndividuals that live in the same area and encounter the same exposure to disturbance sources can experience different costs from disturbance. In accordance with previous studies (Carrete and Tella 2013), we show that there is individual consistency in disturbance responses, i.e. the increased flight time of oystercatchers following transport aircraft distur-bance. These differences in responses may be caused by an individual’s personality (Quinn and Cresswell 2005) or pre-vious experiences with disturbances (Conomy et al. 1998). Contrary to our expectations, however, oystercatchers that had bred locally responded more fiercely and increased flight time more than non-local breeders. Although local breeders may be more used to jets and small civil aircraft, the frequency of occurrence of other human disturbance sources is limited (van der Kolk et al. 2020b). Non-local breeders mostly nest in inland farmland areas, where they may encounter a larger range and higher frequency of human disturbance sources and thus may be more used or more tolerant to a range of (unusual) disturbance sources. Such differences among popu-lations has been shown in song sparrows Melospiza melodia, where individuals in urban areas respond less to disturbance compared to conspecifics in rural areas (Evans et al. 2010).The consequences of disturbance also differ for individuals that vary in their time budget. Individuals within a popula-tion can differ greatly in their foraging time and when they are active (Hertel et al. 2017, van der Kolk et al. 2020a). In general, individuals that forage longer, for example because they are less efficient foragers, are more likely to lose foraging time following disturbance. The costs of disturbance are thus expected to be higher for inefficient individuals.Whether or not disturbance results in actual condition reductions may well depend on the ability of the individual to compensate for disturbance (Blanc et al. 2006, Selman et al. 2013). Individuals can compensate for disturbance by increasing foraging time after disturbance (Urfi et al. 1996, Urfi 2011). In our study, only after the third event forag-ing time was sufficiently prolonged in subsequent tidal peri-ods to compensate for disturbance. A lack of compensation is not necessarily surprising, since foraging time is restricted by the tidal pattern and many individuals may be unable to increase foraging time after disturbance. Alternatively, individuals may increase their foraging efficiency to com-pensate for disturbance (Swennen et al. 1989, Iason et al. 1999). Oystercatchers can also increase their intake effi-ciency by decreasing the handling time of prey, but they are not likely to do so as this increases the risk of bill damage (Swennen et al. 1989). Whether or not individuals can com-pensate will not only depend on how time-limited they are, Figure 4. Relation between predicted foraging time required to compensate for disturbance costs (h) and the actual observed change in foraging time (in h per tidal period) in (a) one or (b) six tidal periods (3 days) following disturbance (7 tidal period for events 1 and 2 combined, 6 tidal periods for event 3). Events 1 and 2 were combined in (b) since they occurred on consecutive days, and compensation effects over three days could thus not be measured separately. Dotted lines indicate the relationship if individuals would increase their forag-ing time sufficiently to compensate for the costs of disturbance.647Figure 5.

(b) Distributions of maximum disturbance (Dcrit) for which individuals can compensate (Fig. 5a). Grey bars indicate the observed distribu-tion from which the normal distribution (black line) was derived. (c) Percentage of the population that is at risk of starving due to disturbance, assuming that disturbance levels are maintained over extended periods and exceeding disturbance threshold will therefore lead to deadly condition reductions. In (b) and (c) functions are also displayed when the individual variation in foraging time observed in (a) would be 10% smaller or larger than the observed distribution.648but also on the environmental conditions, such as food avail-ability (Iason et al. 1999).There seems to be a twofold cost of disturbance for less effi-cient individuals: Firstly, since they spend more time foraging they are more likely to be disturbed while foraging and, sec-ondly, they have less spare time to compensate for disturbance. It is important to note, however, that those are often two sides of the same coin, since both these aspects act via limiting the potential maximum foraging time. Notably, the poten-tial maximum foraging time is also limited upon disturbance for efficient foragers. Since efficient foragers do not utilize all available foraging time, disturbance will not affect their behav-ioural pattern if it takes place when those individuals were not foraging, even though they could have potentially been doing so. In our field study, for example, all individuals were limited in their potential foraging time following the disturbances, but realized foraging time was only affected in individuals that would utilize that time to forage under normal conditions.In many populations, individuals differ not only in how long they forage but also in when they can or prefer to forage, which is due to individual differences in feeding strategy or specialisation (Hertel et al. 2017, van der Kolk et al. 2020a). In these situations, disturbance may only affect the foraging time of a part of the population. For example, in a population where some individuals feed during the night and others dur-ing the day, day-time disturbance will only reduce foraging time of day-time foragers.We empirically studied how individuals vary in their response to disturbance by taking advantage of large distur-bances by transport aircraft. Such disturbances are rare and consequently we could only study three of such events (pos-sibly their rarity also explains the strong response). Although higher sample sizes are preferred, it is challenging to study many disturbances similarly for a high number of individu-als: Studying individual variation in responses to disturbance requires a study setup in which all individuals experience strong disturbances in the same way. Disturbances that have a large impact and significantly affect foraging time are, how-ever, difficult to mimic experimentally and generally rarely occur ‘naturally’. Note, however, that our hypothesis also applies to small disturbances, such as recreational disturbances that affect many species in many areas, since also weak distur-bances are expected to impact time-limited individuals more than others. However, it is challenging to test our hypothesis by studying small disturbances since the direct effects are 1) likely to be too small to accurately measure differences among individuals (e.g. foraging time loss) in the field, and 2) smaller natural disturbances typically only elicit responses at short distances, meaning that individuals that are even several hun-dreds of meters apart are disturbed in different ways by the same event and cannot be meaningfully compared.Feedback loops between condition and disturbance responsesIndividuals that are inefficient and spend more time foraging have been shown to be in a worse condition (black-legged kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla; Angelier et al. 2007), have lower breeding success (European shags Phalacrocorax aris-totelis; Daunt et al. 2014) and have lower apparent sur-vival (Eurasian oystercatchers; van der Kolk et al. 2020a). Feedbacks between an individual’s condition and disturbance response could modulate the impact of both individual vari-ation-pathways on condition reductions (Fig. 1). Individuals balance the energy investment that they put into the distur-bance response against the perceived predation risk (Frid and Dill 2002; risk-disturbance hypothesis in Fig. 1). Animals that are in a worse condition are generally willing to take more predation risks while foraging (Bachman 1993, Sinclair and Arcese 1995, Sweitzer 1996), and were also suggested to invest less energy in responding to disturbance (Stankowich and Blumstein 2005). Since human disturbances are gener-ally non-lethal, this feedback between condition and dis-turbance response could reduce the impact of individual variation on condition reductions. In support of this hypoth-esis, turnstones Arenaria interpres that received supplemen-tary food responded at a larger distance and flew further when approached by walkers in comparison to turnstones that were not fed (Beale and Monaghan 2004). Also, shore-birds respond less to disturbance later in the winter season and with colder temperatures, so under conditions when it is more difficult to meet their energy requirements (Stillman and Goss-Custard 2002, Collop et al. 2016). Alternatively, individuals that are in a worse condition may need to respond equally or earlier as their conspecifics to disturbances when their escape ability is negatively affected by a lower body or health condition (Alzaga et al. 2008; escape ability hypothesis in Fig. 1). Predators may target the weakest individuals, and therefore it is important for weak individuals not to stand out in comparison to conspecifics. This is supported by studies that show that healthier individuals respond less to predatory cues (López et al. 2005, Martín et al. 2006). For example, it was shown that yearlings of the collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis with a shorter flight initiation distance take longer to catch in an aviary, indicating they were in a better condi-tion (Jablonszky et al. 2017).In our study, inefficient foragers are expected to be in a worse condition than efficient foragers, which may explain why they tended to increase their flight time less upon dis-turbance. However, the overall costs of disturbance were still higher for inefficient foragers than for efficient foragers, since they lost more foraging time (Supporting information). In flocking species, such as oystercatchers at high tide roosts, individuals may need to respond simultaneously as group-members to not stand out (Hilton et al. 1999). Following disturbance, all individuals may thus be similarly affected independent of their condition, which may explain why the total costs of disturbance were still higher for inefficient foragers.If environmental conditions are mild, time-limited indi-viduals may be able to take in sufficient energy to main-tain their body condition and are then not necessarily in a worse condition than conspecifics. However, when this is the case, time-limited individuals are the first individuals to be 649negatively affected once disturbance occurs, since they are less able to compensate. Overall, our time-limitation hypothesis thus offers an additional and complementary view on how non-lethal human disturbances may negatively affect an ani-mal’s condition (Fig. 1).Implications for predicting population consequences of disturbancePredicting the population consequences of disturbance is important in conservation research to define effective mitiga-tion measures (Stillman and Goss-Custard 2010, Pirotta et al. 2015, 2018, Hertel et al. 2017). Understanding individual behaviour can be crucial for predicting population processes (Stillman and Goss-Custard 2010, Pirotta et al. 2015). When modelling population effects of disturbance, our study sug-gests that it is important to include individual variation in immediate responses to disturbance as well as variation in individual’s time-budgets. Our hypothesis implies that varia-tion in how time-limited individuals are strongly influences the proportion of the population that is at risk that their con-dition deteriorates due to disturbance. This is true even under low levels of disturbance and under normal winter condi-tions: The estimated disturbance thresholds for the 1% most vulnerable part of the population are threefold lower than for the mean individual (Fig. 6).Individual variation in time budgets is currently not included in many of the models that study the effects of dis-turbance on populations (New et al. 2014), although many existing modelling frameworks would allow inclusion of indi-vidual variation (Pirotta et al. 2018). In individual-based mod-els, however, the effect of individual variation in time budgets on disturbance vulnerability is often already implicitly incor-porated. For example, individual-based models that simulate wintering populations of shorebirds do include individual variation in foraging efficiency (Goss-Custard et al. 2006, Stillman and Goss-Custard 2010). In such models, individu-als with a low foraging efficiency (or individuals that forage on poor sites) will forage on average longer, and therefore also suffer more from disturbance since they have less spare time in which they can compensate for disturbance costs.Finally, disturbance may target the same individuals within a population as harsh weather conditions and poor food stocks: with increasing disturbance, harsher weather conditions and lower food availability, the condition of the most time-limited and least efficient individuals will deteriorate first, ultimately impacting the survival of the population. The impact of dis-turbance, food stocks and weather are thus likely to interact, and models that aim to predict disturbance impacts should ideally consider the synergistic effects of individual variation in time limitation on all these environmental factors combined.Data availability statementData available from the Dryad Digital Repository: <http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.r7sqv9sbf>.

disturbance hypothesis,102306007,Observation of Disturbances for Multivariable Systems,,"Xinkai Chen, Guisheng Zhai",2015,"Abstract:- This paper discusses the disturbance estimation problem for continuous-time multivariable dynamical systems with arbitrarily relative degrees. The disturbances, which are assumed bounded, refer to the combination of the external disturbances, the nonlinearities and the model uncertainties of the system. First, the disturbance observer is proposed for multivariable minimum phase systems. Then, the proposed formulation is extended to nonminimum phase systems, where the nonminimum phase systems are approximated by minimum phase systems based on the least square approximation technique. The estimation error of the disturbances is controlled by the design parameters. Further, the accuracy of the estimation also depends on the frequency of the disturbance signal for nonminimum phase systems.

disturbance hypothesis,484253287,Causal inference in coupled human and natural systems.,,"Ferraro, Paul J, Sanchirico, James N, Smith, Martin D",2019,"Coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) are complex, dynamic, interconnected systems with feedback across social and environmental dimensions. This feedback leads to formidable challenges for causal inference. Two significant challenges involve assumptions about excludability and the absence of interference. These two assumptions have been largely unexplored in the CHANS literature, but when either is violated, causal inferences from observable data are difficult to interpret. To explore their plausibility, structural knowledge of the system is requisite, as is an explicit recognition that most causal variables in CHANS affect a coupled pairing of environmental and human elements. In a large CHANS literature that evaluates marine protected areas, nearly 200 studies attempt to make causal claims, but few address the excludability assumption. To examine the relevance of interference in CHANS, we develop a stylized simulation of a marine CHANS with shocks that can represent policy interventions, ecological disturbances, and technological disasters. Human and capital mobility in CHANS is both a cause of interference, which biases inferences about causal effects, and a moderator of the causal effects themselves. No perfect solutions exist for satisfying excludability and interference assumptions in CHANS. To elucidate causal relationships in CHANS, multiple approaches will be needed for a given causal question, with the aim of identifying sources of bias in each approach and then triangulating on credible inferences. Within CHANS research, and sustainability science more generally, the path to accumulating an evidence base on causal relationships requires skills and knowledge from many disciplines and effective academic-practitioner collaborations",,article,"Humans, Program Evaluation, Environment, Ecosystem, Research, bioeconomics, marine protected areas, quasiexperiment, social-ecological systems, spatial dynamics, Generic health relevance, Life Below Water",,"eScholarship, University of California"

While the study of disturbances is ubiquitous across many ecological disciplines, there is no agreed-upon, cross-disciplinary foundation for discussing or quantifying the complexity of disturbances, and no consistent terminology or methodologies exist. This inconsistency presents an increasingly urgent challenge due to accelerating global change and the threat of interacting disturbances that can destabilize ecosystem responses. By harvesting the expertise of an interdisciplinary cohort of contributors spanning 42 institutions across 15 countries, we identified an essential limitation in disturbance ecology: the word ‘disturbance’ is used interchangeably to refer to both the events that cause, and the consequences of, ecological change, despite fundamental distinctions between the two meanings. In response, we developed a generalizable framework of ecosystem disturbances, providing a well-defined lexicon for understanding disturbances across perspectives and scales. The framework results from ideas that resonate across multiple scientific disciplines and provides a baseline standard to compare disturbances across fields. This framework can be supplemented by discipline-specific variables to provide maximum benefit to both inter- and intra-disciplinary research. To support future syntheses and meta-analyses of disturbance research, we also encourage researchers to be explicit in how they define disturbance drivers and impacts, and we recommend minimum reporting standards that are applicable regardless of scale. Finally, we discuss the primary factors we considered when developing a baseline framework and propose four future directions to advance our interdisciplinary understanding of disturbances and their social-ecological impacts: integrating across ecological scales, understanding disturbance interactions, establishing baselines and trajectories, and developing process-based models and ecological forecasting initiatives. Our experience through this process motivates us to encourage the wider scientific community to continue to explore new approaches for leveraging Open Science principles in generating creative and multidisciplinary ideas",,Article,"Perturbation, reistance, resilience, ecosystem stability, interacting disturbances, compounding disturbances, spatioal, Temporal",,

Understanding the major  mechanisms that contribute to an alien species becoming invasive is seen as essential for limiting the  effects of invasive alien species. However, there are a number of fundamental questions that need  addressing such as why some communities are more vulnerable to invasion than others and, indeed,  why some alien species become widespread and abundant. The enemy release hypothesis (ERH) is  widely evoked to explain the establishment and proliferation of an alien species. ERH predicts that an  alien species introduced to a new region should experience a decrease in regulation by natural enemies  which will lead to an increase in the distribution and abundance of the alien species. At the centre of  this theory is the assumption that natural enemies are important regulators of populations.  Additionally, the theory implies that such natural enemies have a stronger regulatory effect on native  species than they do on alien species in the introduced range, and this disparity in enemy regulation  results in increased population growth of the alien species. However, empirical evidence for the role of  the ERH in invasion success is lacking, particularly for invertebrates. Many studies equate a reduction  in the number of natural enemies associated with an alien species to release without studying  population effects. Further insight is required in relation to the effects of specific natural enemies on  alien and native species (particularly their ability to regulate populations). We review the role of  ecological models in exploring ERH. We suggest that recent developments in molecular technologies  offer considerable promise for investigating ERH in a community context",,"Publication - Article, PeerReviewed","Ecology and Environment, Biology and Microbiology",,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC'

Three releasing functions which ensure the extinction of the pest population are proposed and their corresponding threshold conditions obtained. Aiming to eradicate the pest population, an analytic formula for the number of natural enemies to be released was obtained for each of the three different releasing functions, with emphasis on their biological implications.

We tested the prediction that plant populations are more strongly regulated by natural enemies (herbivores and pathogens) in their native range than in their introduced range with enemy-removal experiments using pesticides. These experiments were replicated at multiple sites in both the native and invaded ranges of the grass Brachypodium sylvaticum. In support of the ERH, enemies consistently regulated populations in the native range. There were more tillers and more seeds produced in treated vs. untreated plots in the native range, and few seedlings survived in the native range. Contrary to the ERH, total measured leaf damage was similar in both ranges, though the enemies that caused it differed. There was more damage by generalist mollusks and pathogens in the native range, and more damage by generalist insect herbivores in the invaded range. Demographic analysis showed that population growth rates were lower in the native range than in the invaded range, and that sexually produced seedlings constituted a smaller fraction of the total in the native range.

Periods of relaxed enemy pressure also occur in, and may drive, population oscillations and outbreaks. We draw attention to similarities among circumstances of enemy escape and build a general conceptual framework for the phenomenon. Although these circumstances share common mechanisms and depend on common assumptions, enemy escape can involve dynamics operating on very different temporal and spatial scales. In particular, the duration of enemy escape is rarely considered but will likely vary among circumstances. Enemy escape can have important evolutionary consequences including increasing competitive ability, spurring diversification, or triggering enemy counteradaptation.

enemy release hypothesis,357202919,Distributed under Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 OPEN ACCESS A review and meta-analysis of the enemy release hypothesis in plant-herbivorous insect systems,,"Kim Meijer, Menno Schilthuizen, Leo Beukeboom, Christian Smit",2020,"ABSTRACT A suggested mechanism for the success of introduced non-native species is the enemy release hypothesis (ERH). Many studies have tested the predictions of the ERH using the community approach (native and non-native species studied in the same habitat) or the biogeographical approach (species studied in their native and non-native range), but results are highly variable, possibly due to large variety of study systems incorporated. We therefore focused on one specific system: plants and their herbivorous insects. We performed a systematic review and compiled a large number (68) of datasets from studies comparing herbivorous insects on native and non-native plants using the community or biogeographical approach. We performed a meta-analysis to test the predictions from the ERH for insect diversity (number of species), insect load (number of individuals) and level of herbivory for both the community and biogeographical approach. For both the community and biogeographical approach insect diversity was significantly higher on native than on non-native plants. Insect load tended to be higher on native than non-native plants at the community approach only. Herbivory was not different between native and non-native plants at the community approach, while there was too little data available for testing the biogeographical approach. Our metaanalysis generally supports the predictions from the ERH for both the community and biogeographical approach, but also shows that the outcome is importantly determined by the response measured and approach applied. So far, very few studies apply both approaches simultaneously in a reciprocal manner while this is arguably the best way for testing the ERH. Subjects Ecolog",,text,,,

This insight has gained traction in the political realm since the activities of Wikileaks, which hopes to attack 'unjust' systems or 'conspiracies'. Eventually, such threats to information security rely on a biologistic argument on the benefits and drawbacks that uncontrolled leaking might pose for 'just' and 'unjust' entities. Such biological metaphors are almost exclusively based on the economic advantage of participants. Here, I introduce a mathematical model of the complex dynamics implied by leaking. The complex interactions of adversaries are modeled by coupled logistic equations including network effects of econo-communication networks. The modeling shows, that there might arise situations where the leaking envisioned and encouraged by Wikileaks and the like can strengthen the defending entity (the 'conspiracy'). In particular, the only severe impact leaking can have on an organization seems to originate in the exploitation of leaks by another entity the organization competes with. Therefore, the model suggests that leaks can be used as a `tactical mean' in direct adversary relations, but do not necessarily increase public benefit and societal immunization to 'conspiracies'. Furthermore, within the model the exploitation of the (open) competition between entities seems to be a more promising approach to control malicious organizations : divide-et-impera policies triumph here",,"Artikel, PeerReviewed",,,

Secondly, anti-rumor information and an evolutionary game mechanism are introduced into the traditional SIR model, binary information is introduced to analyze the anti-rumor dissemination model SDIR, and the four state transitions and dissemination processes of SDIR are discussed. Finally, the SDIR model is experimentally validated in different datasets and dissemination models. The experimental results show that the SDIR model is in line with the actual dissemination law, and it can be proved that high self-identification ability plays a certain role in suppressing rumors; the anti-rumor information effectively inhibits the spread of rumor information to a certain extent.

The analysis matched parasite communities of (i) L. haematocheilus across its native and introduced populations (Sea of Japan and Sea of Azov, respectively) and (ii) the introduced population of L. haematocheilus with native populations of M. cephalus (Mediterranean, Azov-Black and Japan Seas). The total mean abundance (TMA), as a feature of the infection level in helminth communities, and slope b of the Taylor’s power law, as a measure of parasite aggregation at the infra and component-community levels, were estimated and compared between host species and localities using ANOVA. The TMA of the whole helminth community in the introduced population of L. haematocheilus was over 15 times lower than that of the native population, but the difference was less pronounced for carried (monogeneans) than for acquired (adult and larval digeneans) parasite communities. Similar to the abundance pattern, the species distribution in communities from the invasive population of L. haematocheilus was less aggregated than from its native population for endoparasitic helminths, including adult and larval digeneans, while monogeneans showed a similar pattern of distribution in the compared populations of L. haematocheilus. The aggregation level of the whole helminth community, endoparasitic helminths, adult and larval digeneans was lower in the invasive host species in comparison with native ones as shown by differences in the slope b. An important theoretical implication from this study is that the pattern of parasite aggregation may explain the success of invasive species in ecosystems. Because the effects of parasites on host mortality are likely dose-dependent, the proportion of susceptible host individuals in invasive species is expected to be lower, as the helminth distribution in the invasive host was featured by a higher number of uninfected hosts and a shorter distribution tail when compared with native species",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/article, Journal articles","Liza haematocheilus, Mugil cephalus, Taylor’s law, Species abundance distribution, Total mean abundance, [SDV.MP.PAR]Life Sciences [q-bio]/Microbiology and Parasitology/Parasitology",,'Elsevier BV'

We use a Monte Carlo simulation method to characterize the dynamics of the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) and SIAR models, showing that the SIAR model with consideration of authoritative information gives a more realistic description of propagation features of rumors than the SIR model. The simulation results demonstrate that the critical threshold λc of the SIAR model has the tiniest increase than the threshold of SIR model. The sooner the authoritative information is introduced, the less negative impact the rumors will bring. We also get the result that heterogeneous networks are more prone to the spreading of rumors. Additionally, the inhibition of rumor spreading, as one of the characteristics of the new SIAR model itself, is instructive for later studies on the rumor spreading models and the controlling strategies",,article,"rumor spreading, homogeneous networks, heterogeneous networks, authoritative information, SIAR model, threshold, Science, Q, Astrophysics, QB460-466, Physics, QC1-999",1099-4300,MDPI AG

Based on the prediction, we propose a method of security measurement. In detail, we compute the optimal attack timing from the perspective of attacker, using a long-term game to estimate the risk of being found and then choose the optimal timing based on the risk and profit. We design a learning strategy to model the information sharing mechanism among multiattackers and use spatial structure to model the long-term process.

We then leverage Symantec's data sharing platform WINE to validate our model by analysing records of attacks against more than 1M real systems. We find the 'Model of the Work-Averse Attacker' to be strongly supported by the data and, in particular, that: (a) the great majority of attacks per software version is driven by one vulnerability only; (b) an exploit lives two years before being substituted by a new one; (c) the exploit arrival rate depends on the software's update rate rather than on time or knowledge of the vulnerability.\u3c/p\u3",,,,,'Association for Information Systems'

NET production has been demonstrated in the lungs of mice infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Aspergillus fumigatus.

Evasion strategies fall into three main categories: inhibition of NET release by down-regulating host inflammatory responses; degradation of NETs using pathogen-derived DNases; and resistance to the microbicidal components of NETs, which involves a variety of mechanisms, including encapsulation. Hence, the evasion of NETs appears to be a widespread strategy to allow pathogen proliferation and dissemination, and is currently a topic of intense research interest.

All rights reserved. Social networking sites have become instrumental in spreading information online, which unfortunately includes rumors and misinformation. Past studies have investigated the spread of rumors without considering that truth may spread simultaneously. This study considers both the spread of truth and rumor and investigates the result of their coexistence in a population. We formulated the spreader-spreader interaction model and the exposed-spreader interaction model based on the epidemiological SEIR model. In the spreader-spreader interaction model, the spreaders try to influence the opposing spreaders whereas, in the exposed-spreader interaction model, the spreaders try to influence the exposed individuals from the opposing side. In our study, we calculated the reproduction numbers for truth and rumor, determined the stability of the model at the equilibrium points, and determined an approach for spreading truth while halting rumors. In the spreader-spreader model, we have shown that increasing the removal rate of Spreaders of Rumor decreases the prevalence of rumor in the population. Whereas in the exposed-spreader model, we showed that increasing the conversion rate of Exposed to Rumor to Exposed to Truth significantly increases the amount of Exposed to Truth in the population, thereby making it an effective mechanism for promoting the spread of truth. In conclusion, it is harder to control the information epidemic in the exposed-spreader model but, compared to the spreader-spreader model, information spreads faster according to the exposed-spreader model. For certain information to be endemic to a population, our study proposes that spreaders take advantage during the first few days of the information diffusion process",,text,,,Animo Repository

When studying sets of algorithms various issues arise about how to construct the algorithms and in which order or in which combination to release them. In this paper, we consider the question of whether the order in which a set of defensive algorithms is released has a significant impact on the time taken by attackers to break the combined set of algorithms. The rationale behind our approach is that attackers learn from their attempts, and that the release schedule of defensive mechanisms can be adjusted so as to impair that learning process.

The theoretical model predicts that mass attackers will preferably (i) exploit only one vulnerability per software version, (ii) largely include only vulnerabilities requiring low attack complexity, and (iii) be slow at trying to weaponize new vulnerabilities. These predictions are empirically validated on a large data set of observed massed attacks launched against a large collection of information systems.

This is important because a prey animal might have inadvertently arrived at a patch on which a sit-and-wait predator is lurking, a common situation in many species of animals. In a simulation model, we explore how long the ambushing predator should wait before attacking the prey animal and how the prey animal can adjust its vigilance in response. We adopted a war-of-attrition framework where the predator selects randomly an attack time from a distribution to keep the prey guessing and where the prey also keep the predator guessing by selecting randomly a time at which to switch from high to low vigilance. We found that an evolutionarily stable solution can emerge in this game and has the following form under a broad range of ecological conditions: the predator attacks early and the prey adopts a high vigilance early and then switches later to a lower vigilance. The results indicate that antipredator vigilance may change as a function of time rather than being a constant value as assumed in most vigilance models. We conclude that the uncertainty that ambushing predators and their prey must plant in the minds of the other can have important consequences for the evolution of predator and prey tactics.</p",,article,,,

Firstly, the dynamics process of the propagation model is described by using the mean-field equations. Secondly, the equilibrium point and the basic regeneration number of the model are solved, and the existence and stability of the equilibrium point are discussed. Then, numerical simulations are used to analyze the effects of different factors on rumor propagation patterns.

W., Pierce, Naomi E.",2016,"Although mutualisms are common in all ecological communities and have played key roles in the diversification of life, our current understanding of the evolution of cooperation applies mostly to social behavior within a species. A central question is whether mutualisms persist because hosts have evolved costly punishment of cheaters. Here, we use the economic theory of employment contracts to formulate and distinguish between two mechanisms that have been proposed to prevent cheating in host–symbiont mutualisms, partner fidelity feedback (PFF) and host sanctions (HS). Under PFF, positive feedback between host fitness and symbiont fitness is sufficient to prevent cheating; in contrast, HS posits the necessity of costly punishment to maintain mutualism. A coevolutionary model of mutualism finds that HS are unlikely to evolve de novo, and published data on legume–rhizobia and yucca–moth mutualisms are consistent with PFF and not with HS. Thus, in systems considered to be textbook cases of HS, we find poor support for the theory that hosts have evolved to punish cheating symbionts; instead, we show that even horizontally transmitted mutualisms can be stabilized via PFF. PFF theory may place previously underappreciated constraints on the evolution of mutualism and explain why punishment is far from ubiquitous in nature.Organismic and Evolutionary Biolog",,Journal Article,"evolution of cooperation, punishment, symbiosis, partner fidelity feedback, host sanctions",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'
Enhanced Mutualism Hypothesis,302982630,Coevolutionary adaptation in mutualisms,,"Wyatt, Gregory Alan Kenneth, West, Stuart A., Gardner, Andy",2014,"Natural selection favours those individuals that respond best to novel features of their selective environment. For many, a critical challenge is responding to evolutionary change in mutualistic species. These responses create complex feedbacks, so only coevolutionary approaches are able to fully answer key questions about the maintenance or disruption of mutualistic behaviour, and explain the range of mechanisms that allow individuals to benefit from these associations. I first consider the hypothesis that economic models studying multiple classes of traders, where each trader seeks to optimise its own payoffs will yield insights into mutualistic systems. I show that individuals can be favoured to discriminate amongst potential partners based on the price for which they provide resources. Then, I show that market mechanisms can maintain cooperation and drive specialisation in mutualistic systems. I extend this market model to allow individuals to restrict a mutualistic partner's access to resources, and show that this strategy can stabilise cooperation and increase the fitness of both partners. I also explicitly incorporate relatedness in my market model. I show that high relatedness sometimes increases cooperativeness in members of a mutualistic species, but sometimes decreases cooperativeness as it narrow the scope for partner choice to maintain cooperation. Having studied market mechanisms, I consider indiscriminate costly help to members of another species. I discover that this trait can be favoured by natural selection and can be classified as either altruism between or altruism within species. Finally, I consider a framework for analysing coevolved phenotypic responses to a partner's cooperativeness, a challenging process to model. I demonstrate that this framework can yield firm predictions about behaviour whenever partners hold private information about their costs and benefits.This thesis is currently not available via ORA",,"text, thesis","Biology, Evolution (zoology), Game theory,economics,social and behavioral sciences (mathematics), mutualism, social evolution, cooperation, coevolution, adaptation",,

The costs and benefits of mutualism often depend on the abiotic or biotic context in which an interaction occurs, and experimental manipulations can induce shifts in interaction outcomes from mutualism all the way to parasitism. Yet, research suggests that mutualisms rarely turn parasitic in nature. Similarly, despite the potential for 'cheating' to undermine mutualism evolution, empirical evidence for fitness conflicts between partners and, thus, selection for cheating in mutualisms is scant. Furthermore, mutualism seldom leads to parasitism at macroevolutionary timescales. Thus, I argue here that mutualisms do not deserve their reputation for ecological and evolutionary instability, and are not on the verge of breakdown.I also acknowledge funding from an NSERC Discovery Grant and Accelerator Supplement, and thank S.

Selection against cheaters should eliminate genetic variation in partner quality—yet such variation is often found in natural populations. One explanation for this paradox is that mutualism outcomes are determined not only by responses to partner performance but also by partner signals. Here, we build a model of coevolution in a symbiotic mutualism, in which hosts’ ability to sanction noncooperative symbionts and recognition of symbiont signals are determined by separate loci, as are symbionts’ cooperation and expression of signals. In the model, variation persists without destabilizing the interaction, in part because coevolution of symbiont signals and host recognition is altered by the coevolution of sanctions and cooperation, and vice versa. Individual-based simulations incorporating population structure strongly corroborate these results. The dual systems of sanctions and partner recognition converge toward conditions similar to some economic models of mutualistic symbiosis, in which hosts offering the right incentives to potential symbionts can initiate symbiosis without screening for partner quality. These results predict that mutualists can maintain variation in recognition of partner signals or in the ability to sanction noncooperators without destabilizing mutualism, and they reinforce the notion that studies of mutualism should consider communication between partners as well as the exchange of benefits",,"Life sciences, medicine and health care","Life sciences, medicine and health care",,

Rewarding cooperators and punishing defectors can help maintain mutualism; this is not possible, however, when one can only respond to the collective action of one's partners, which is likely to be the case in many common symbioses. We show how the theory of public goods can explain the stability of mutualism when discrimination between cooperators and defectors is not possible: if two groups of individuals trade goods that are non-linear, increasing functions of the number of contributions, their mutualistic interaction is maintained by the exchange of these public goods, even when it is not possible to punish defectors, which can persist at relatively high frequencies.

In an evolutionary game where two defenders can cooperate to defend a common resource, this paper analyzes the common-enemy hypothesis when adversity is endogenous, in that an attacker sets the number of attacks. As a benchmark, we first consider exogenous adversity, where adversity is not subject to evolution. In this case, the common-enemy hypothesis is predicted when the degree of complementarity between defenders’ defensive efforts is sufficiently low. When the degree of complementarity is high, the hypothesis is predicted only when cooperation costs are high; when cooperation costs are instead low, a competing hypothesis is predicted, where adversity discourages cooperation. Second, we consider the case of endogenous adversity. In this case, we continue to predict the competing hypothesis for a high degree of complementarity and low cooperation costs.

Contemporary theory on the population ecology of mutualism explicitly focuses on how fitness benefits are conferred from a mutualist to a focal population, which depends on the mutualist partner's density (i.e., functional response).  This body of work implicitly makes the assumption that the per capita benefit received by the focal population is the same, regardless of its density.  The consequence of this assumption was examined in one study that found it to be important, but partner density was not examined.  In this study we bridge examining intraspecific and interspecific densities to investigate their roles on the population dynamics of mutualism.  We created a two-species model that allowed us to explicitly modify both how benefits are received as a function of intraspecific density and how benefits are conferred by a partner as a function of interspecific density.  We also synthesized empirical work on mutualism that explicitly took focal or partner densities into account.  Our principal finding was that anytime mutualistic benefits were either conferred or received at low densities, irrespective or the strength of the mutualistic benefit, populations were always stable and never positively fed back.  We found few studies that explicitly considered population densities, but most show mutualistic benefits being received or conferred at low densities---a promising bearing for future research.  Receiving benefits, and consequently increasing growth, when rare is a key component in many of ways we understand community ecology, including promoting coexistence and strengthening resilience.

We show that: (i) restriction can be favoured when restricting individuals increase their comparative advantage and thus receive more favourable terms of trade; (ii) restriction maintains cooperation in conditions where cooperative behaviour would otherwise collapse; and (iii) restriction can lead to either an increase or decrease in a restricted individual’s fitness.

In this paper, firstly, we examine the history and signification of mutualism in relation to symbiosis. Then, we consider the link between concepts and models of mutualism. Models of mutualism depend on different concepts we use: If mutualism is situated at populations' level, it will be expressed by Lotka-Volterra models, concerning exclusively populations' size. If mutualism is considered as a resources' exchange or a biological market increasing the fitness of these organisms, it will be described at an individual level by a cost-benefit model. Our analysis will be limited to the history and epistemology of Lotka-Volterra models and we hypothesize that these models are adapted at first to translate dynamic evolutions of mutualism. They render stability or variations of size and assume that there are clear distinctions and a state of equilibrium between populations of different species. Italian mathematician Vito Volterra demonstrated that biological associations consist in a constant relation between some species. In 1931 and 1935, Volterra described the general form of antagonistic or mutualistic biological associations by the same differential equations. We recognize that these equations have been more used to model competition or prey-predator interactions, but a simple sign change allows describing mutualism. The epistemological problem is the following: Volterra's equations help us to conceptualize a global phenomenon. However, mutualistic interactions may have stronger effects away from equilibrium and these effects may be better understood at individual level. We conclude that, between 1985 and 2000, some researchers carried on working and converting Lotka-Volterra models but this description appeared as insufficient.

As is wellknown since Darwin, this creates challenges for evolutionaryexplanation, since in modern evolutionary theory, cooperativebehavior must always be grounded in the individual and in-clusive fitness of the cooperator.In this modern context, there are two main theories of theevolution of human cooperation, both of which focus on themost difficult theoretical problem from the point of view ofevolutionary theory: altruism. The first theory comes fromevolutionary psychology and is often called the Big MistakeHypothesis (e.g., Burnham and Johnson 2005). The basic ideais that human altruistic tendencies evolved at a time whenhumans lived in small groups, comprised mostly of kin. Inthis setting, altruistic acts would either (a) benefit kin, andso evolve due to kin selection, or else (b) benefit the altruistby enhancing in some way her chances for reciprocity, whichis especially critical in small groups in which reputationalassessment among familiar interactants is constant.

Thispaper was submitted 9 II 11 and accepted 3 IX 11.some tendency toward altruism (and antipathy toward cheat-ers) because the proximate mechanism operates as if the an-cient, small-group conditions still held.The second theory is the Cultural Group Selection Hy-pothesis (e.g., Henrich and Henrich 2007; Richerson andBoyd 2005), and it focuses on a later stage in human evolutioncharacterized by larger social groups. The basic idea is thatsocial groups with more altruists will, for various reasons,outcompete other groups. The difference from previous groupselection hypotheses is that the main transmission across gen-erations takes place not genetically but culturally. For otherreasons, modern humans are built to imitate others (e.g.,successful others or the majority), and so if a group has al-truists, others will often imitate them, and that will lead togroup success. As groups become larger in scale, those thatcreate social norms and institutions that better promote al-truism will again thrive relative to others. No biological ad-aptations for altruism are necessarily involved here, but thetheory does allow for later gene-culture coevolution in whichindividuals biologically adapt to life in a culture characterizedby conformist social transmission, group punishment andnorms, and group competition.In what follows, we propose an approach to the evolutionof human cooperation that begins in a different place. Ourstarting point is not cooperation as altruistic helping, butrather cooperation as mutualistic collaboration. Our hypoth-esis, which we call the Interdependence Hypothesis, is that atThis content downloaded from 128.243.002.141 on January 25, 2016 04:25:49 AMAll use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).674 Current Anthropology Volume 53, Number 6, December 2012some point humans created lifeways in which collaboratingwith others was necessary for survival and procreation (andcheating was controlled by partner choice). This situation ofinterdependence led inevitably to altruism, as individuals nat-urally wanted to help the collaborative partners on whomthey depended for, for example, foraging success. Moreover,interdependent collaboration also helps to explain humans’unique forms of cognition and social organization, since it iscollaboration, not altruism, that creates the many coordina-tion problems that arise as individuals attempt to put theirheads together in acts of shared intentionality1 to create andmaintain the complex technologies, symbol systems, and cul-tural institutions of modern human societies.Our evolutionary story comprises two distinct steps, thefirst focusing on small-scale contexts (though we focus onaspects different from the Big Mistake Hypothesis) and thesecond focusing on group-level contexts (though we focus onaspects different from the Cultural Group Selection Hypoth-esis). First, small-scale collaboration involving cognitivelycomplex coordination problems took place initially, we willargue, in the context of collaborative foraging. Although hu-mans’ more stable reproductive bonds (Chapais 2008) andcooperative breeding (Hrdy 2009) clearly played an importantrole in establishing the motivational and emotional founda-tions, the cognitive dimension of human cooperation evolvedin contexts in which, in order to acquire food, individualshad to create together various coordination strategies (ofteninvolving technologies), which they then could communicatecooperatively to others within and across generations (Ster-elny 2012). Second, group-level collaboration followed as theentire social group needed to work together interdependentlyin order to compete with other social groups, leading to suchthings as group-created conventions, norms, and institutions.This step was undoubtedly followed by something like culturalgroup selection, but cultural group selection explains why theparticular social norms and institutions of particular culturalgroups have prevailed, and this assumes species-universalskills and motivations—such as those we will posit—for cre-ating social norms and institutions in the first place.In support of our hypotheses, we focus on two sources ofevidence not common in anthropology. First, we invoke ex-perimental studies, many from our own laboratory, that com-pare the cognitive and motivational skills of humans, mostlyyoung children, and their nearest great ape relatives (as rep-resentative, in a very general way, of the last common an-cestor). We show that even young children are adapted forcollaborative activities in a way that other great apes are not.Second, we also in some cases invoke human ontogenetic1. Here we use the term “shared intentionality” to refer to collaborativephenomena in general. We use the term “joint intentionality” for the adhoc, temporary collaborations characteristic of, e.g., foraging parties (step1 of our story) and the term “collective intentionality” for the moreimpersonal yet permanent group-minded practices and modes of col-laboration that characterize cultural groups as a whole (step 2 of ourstory).sequences as suggestive of potential phylogenetic sequences,for example, that young children in fact (and possibly oflogical necessity) learn to collaborate with other individualsin concrete situations before they construct more abstractgroup-level phenomena such as social norms and institutions.We invoke observations of modern foragers and some paleo-anthropological data, as is more customary in evolutionarytheorizing, in a few places as well.First Step: Obligate Collaborative ForagingThe central challenge of social life is often presented as aPrisoner’s Dilemma in which the individual must choose be-tween its own well-being and that of the group. But the Pris-oner’s Dilemma arises only in very special circumstances, andit does indeed tend to block cooperation. A better model forreal-life cooperation is the Stag Hunt (Skyrms 2004). StagHunt situations are those in which (i) individuals must col-laborate with others to benefit, (ii) the benefits of the collab-oration are greater than those of any solo alternatives, and(iii) all solo alternatives must be forsaken (risked) in orderto collaborate. In the classic parable, I am hunting alone forhares when I spy a stag—which is much better food but whichI cannot capture alone. You are in exactly the same situation,and so it is in both our interests to drop our pursuit of haresand collaborate to capture the stag and then share the spoils.(This general scenario can easily be extended to other foragingactivities, including many gathering activities such as pro-curing honey collaboratively.)Human collaborative foraging first occurred, we hypoth-esize, in Stag Hunt–type situations in which all participantshad alternatives but anticipated an even greater benefit fromsuccessful capturing of the stag (see Alvard 2012). Althoughmuch of the foraging of contemporary hunter-gatherers isonly loosely collaborative, this is very likely because modernforagers have the kinds of projectile weapons that enable in-dividuals to be successful (from a safe distance) where pre-viously only small groups of individuals working togethercould attain foraging success (and contemporary foragers alsosee themselves as part of a group, as in our step 2 [see below],and so bring the bounty back to the home base for sharing).In stark contrast, nonhuman great apes—and so, by hypoth-esis, the last common ancestor—were and are almost exclu-sively individual foragers. Chimpanzees and bonobos maysearch for food in small social groups, but when they findfood, each individual procures and consumes it on its own(with sharing only under special circumstances). They do notextract or otherwise obtain food by working collaborativelywith others, nor do they, as humans do, bring food back tosome central location to provision others.The one potential exception is the group hunting of mon-keys by some (but not all) groups of chimpanzees (Boeschand Boesch 1989; Watts and Mitani 2002). What happensprototypically is that a small party of male chimpanzees spiesThis content downloaded from 128.243.002.141 on January 25, 2016 04:25:49 AMAll use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).Tomasello et al. Interdependence Hypothesis 675a red colobus monkey somewhat separated from its group,and they proceed to surround and capture it (normally oneindividual begins the chase and others scramble to the mon-key’s possible escape routes). One individual actually capturesthe monkey, but all participants usually end up getting at leastsome meat. Chimpanzee group hunting can be reasonablymodeled as a Stag Hunt situation, since it is difficult forindividuals to capture monkeys on their own, and they alwayshave other, less exciting alternative foods potentially available.If the many collaborative foraging activities of humans andthe one collaborative foraging activity of great apes representStag Hunt–type situations, we may compare humans and theirnearest great ape relatives in terms of their proximate mech-anisms, both cognitive and motivational, for operating in suchsituations. We may best do this by telling a very general evo-lutionary story (supported by comparative experimental data)about how humans developed new strategies to meet the threemain challenges to Stag Hunt collaboration as an evolution-arily stable subsistence strategy:a) Sharing the spoils: individuals had to find some way todivide the spoils at the end of the collaboration such thatthere was no destructive fighting and such that everyone wasincentivized for future stag hunting.b) Coordination: individuals had to find some way to makea confidence-inspiring “group decision” about whether to gofor the stag, given that each of them had to relinquish their“hare in the hand” to do so.c) Temptations to free ride: individuals had to solve theproblem that if there were more people present than wereneeded to capture the stag (but all could eat), then everyonehad an incentive to let the others do the hard and risky workof stag killing—resulting in inaction from everyone.In their group hunting of monkeys, chimpanzees have waysof meeting all three of these challenges. But humans havecome to meet them in some demonstrably different ways,using species-unique proximate mechanisms.Sharing the SpoilsChimpanzees, like most primates, are mostly herbivorous(and insectivorous). They forage in small social parties mainlyfor ripe fruit and some insects, consuming other vegetationas backup. When the party finds a patch of fruit, typicallyeveryone gets some by scrambling, which works well becausethe fruit is at least moderately spread out in the tree or onthe ground. If they encounter monopolizable food, the en-suing contest-competition will go to the dominant individualin typical mammalian fashion.The consequences of this way of doing business for col-laboration may be clearly seen in a recent experiment. Melis,Hare, and Tomasello (2006b) presented pairs of chimpanzeeswith out-of-reach food on a platform that could be obtainedonly if both individuals pulled simultaneously on the twoends of a rope. When there were two piles of food, one infront of each individual, the pair often collaborated success-fully. However, when there was only one pile of food in themiddle of the platform, pulling it in often resulted in thedominant individual monopolizing all of the food. This nat-urally demotivated the subordinate for future collaborationwith this individual, and so cooperation fell apart over trials.Chimpanzees’ predominant solution to food competition ingeneral, namely, dominance, tends to destabilize collaborativeforaging over time.So why does not dominance undermine chimpanzees’group hunting of monkeys? The answer is twofold. First, dom-inant chimpanzees do not normally take small parcels of foodaway from subordinates who already have it in their grasp.So if the captor of the monkey is subordinate, he neverthelessis typically able to eat his fill. Second, even if the captor isdominant, he cannot monopolize the carcass himself becauseit is too big. As with social carnivores like lions and wolves,trying to protect a large carcass with other hungry individualsapproaching is a losing battle. After the kill, noncaptors harassthe captor (no matter his dominance) and obtain pieces ofmeat from the too-big-to-monopolize carcass, with those whoharass most getting the most meat (Gilby 2006). Althoughthere is some favoritism in “meat sharing” toward coalitionarypartners (Mitani and Watts 2001), the most important factorin noncaptors’ obtaining of meat is, not surprisingly, domi-nance (Boesch 1994).Humans share their spoils differently. Contemporaryhunter-gatherers routinely share the spoils of their collabo-rative foraging on the scene, without harassment, and largepackets of food are almost always brought back to some cen-tral location and shared with nonparticipants (Gurven 2004).Different cultural groups may do this differently, and it maywork differently with particular resources, but there are nohuman groups who behave like other great apes in simplyscrambling for food competitively in most situations, withdominants taking all that they can regardless of others. Andunlike great apes, humans actively provision their childrenwith food for many years, with human children being wellinto their teens in most cases before they actually pull theirown weight (Hill 1993).In experiments, humans are much more generous withfood than are chimpanzees, and they expect their conspecificsto be more generous (even fair) as well. Thus, in economicgames, humans routinely take into account the needs anddesires of others, whereas this is not the case for chimpanzees.For example, humans routinely give a significant portion ofsome windfall resource to an unknown individual in dictatorgames, whereas no one has ever performed a dictator gamewith chimpanzees because the outcome—that they would ac-tively give none of their windfall to others—is already known.In ultimatum games, humans typically expect their playingpartner to expect a reasonable offer (with “reasonable” de-pending on general cultural norms; Henrich et al. 2006),whereas chimpanzees in the ultimatum game seem not totake into account the needs or expectations of their playingpartner at all (Jensen, Call, and Tomasello 2007a).This content downloaded from 128.243.002.141 on January 25, 2016 04:25:49 AMAll use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).676 Current Anthropology Volume 53, Number 6, December 2012But it is not until the second step of our account (in thesection “Second Step: Group-Mindedness”) that we includesuch things as group-wide social norms of fairness and thelike, and so for now, a better representative of the humanspecies would be children—before they have become fullynormative beings. Nevertheless, even without internalizednorms, human children are more generous with valued re-sources than are their great ape relatives. In one fairly directcomparison, both Silk et al. (2005) and Jensen et al. (2006)found that when pulling in food for themselves, chimpanzeesdid not care whether this also resulted in a companion gettingfood. In contrast, Brownell, Svetlova, and Nichols (2009)found that even 2-year-old children—well before they self-govern through social norms—chose to pull food to them-selves more often when that also meant food for their com-panion. Chimpanzees will in some situations help others gainaccess to food (Melis et al. 2011b; Warneken et al. 2007), butonly if the helper has no possibility of obtaining the foodherself.Perhaps of most importance for the current account, hu-man children share the spoils after collaboration in species-unique ways. Thus, Warneken et al. (2011) presented pairsof 3-year-old children with the same task presented to chim-panzees by Melis, Hare, and Tomasello (2006b): a board theyhad to pull in together, with food either (i) predivided onthe two ends of the board or (ii) clumped in the middle.Unlike the apes, children collaborated readily in both of thesesituations. Even more striking, in a direct comparison of spe-cies, Hamann, Warneken, and Tomasello (2011) found that3-year-old children shared resources more equitably if thoseresources resulted from their collaborative efforts, rather thanfrom parallel work or no work at all, whereas chimpanzees“shared” (allowed the other to take) to the same degree (andinfrequently) no matter how the spoils were produced (seealso Melis, Schneider, and Tomasello 2011a).How might we account for an evolutionary transition fromthe way that other great apes treat food to the way that hu-mans treat food—especially after a collaboration? One es-pecially plausible transitional context is scavenging. Thus, asthe genus Homo was emerging some 2 million years ago, aglobal cooling and drying trend created an expansion of openenvironments and a radiation in terrestrial monkeys, whowould have competed with Homo for many plant foods. Scav-enging large carcasses killed by other animals would have beenone possible response. Such scavenging would have requiredmultiple participants, as other carnivores would be competingfor those carcasses as well.Individuals would be especially well suited for scavengingif they were tolerant of conspecifics cofeeding on a carcasswith them. An important finding in this regard is that whenexperimenters pair together chimpanzee individuals who areespecially tolerant with one another in the context of food(established by an independent food tolerance test), they aremuch more likely to collaborate successfully and share thespoils at the end than are intolerant partners (Melis, Hare,and Tomasello 2006b). And bonobos show both more tol-erance around food and more cooperation in obtaining andsharing monopolizable food than do chimpanzees (Hare etal. 2007). These findings suggest that variation in tolerancearound food among individuals of the last common ancestorto Homo and Pan might have served as the raw material onwhich natural selection worked on the way to a species thatactively shared the spoils of collaboration (Hare and Toma-sello 2005).It is also likely that at some point, individuals who at-tempted to hog all of the food at a scavenged carcass wouldbe actively repelled by others and perhaps shunned in otherways as well—a first step toward what Boehm (2001) calls“counter-dominance.” Chimpanzees already engage in socialselection of collaborative partners, preferentially choosing apartner with whom they have had success over one withwhom they have previously had difficulties (Melis, Hare, andTomasello 2006a). Scavenging Homo would thus have alreadyhad a tendency to avoid dominants who tried to monopolizethe carcass. Moreover, a small coalition attacking a greedydominant to drive him away would have been a simple ex-tension from driving other species away from the carcass (andof course chimpanzees already form small social coalitions inintragroup conflicts). The outcome of socially selectingagainst dominants is of course that good cooperators get se-lected “for” by being chosen more often as collaborative part-ners.As humans became ever more dependent on collaborativeforaging—and so ever more interdependent with others inthe social group—additional factors contributed to their ten-dency to share resources with others relatively generously andeven fairly. But for now, we are interested only in the earlysteps (perhaps in combination with cooperative breeding),and our proposal is that in the context of scavenging, theindividuals who did best were those who (1) were tolerant ofothers peacefully cofeeding on the same carcass and (2) didnot attempt to hog the spoils and so be socially selected againstby others for selfish behavior.CoordinationBoesch and Boesch (1989) describe chimpanzees’ group hunt-ing of monkeys in very human-like terms, with participantshaving a shared goal and well-defined roles. Focusing on thechimpanzees of the Taı¨ Forest (since in more open environ-ments chimpanzees use more solo and less coordinated strat-egies), they posit that all of the chimpanzees have the sharedgoal of capturing the monkey. Then a “driver” begins chasinga monkey, while “blockers” prevent lines of escape and an“ambusher” attempts to make the kill. However, it is alsopossible that what the chimpanzees are doing is somethingless cooperative, that is, the initiating chimpanzee is attempt-ing to capture the monkey for itself since the captor gets mostmeat (or else he knows from experience that once he initiatesthe chase, a group kill will often ensue and he will get at leastThis content downloaded from 128.243.002.141 on January 25, 2016 04:25:49 AMAll use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).Tomasello et al. Interdependence Hypothesis 677some meat), and then the others go to places where theyexpect to maximize their chances of capturing the fleeingmonkey, which also increases the group’s chances as an un-intentional by-product (Tomasello 2008; Tomasello et al.2005).It is not that each chimpanzee is scrambling for the monkeyon its own, ignoring the others. In deciding what to do, eachparticipant takes into account the position of the others andtheir behavior and how these might influence the monkey’sflight. The coordination is therefore an emergent propertygenerated by individual decision making not aimed at thatcoordination. Thus, Melis, Hare, and Tomasello (2006a)found that in situations in which a chimpanzee could pull ina board with food by itself, that is what it did (in preferenceto opening a door for a potential partner). But if pulling inthe board required two individuals, then they would eitherwait for their partner or even open a door for the other tojoin. The chimpanzees were mainly interested in their ownacquisition of food, but they understood when they neededa partner for success. Similarly, Bullinger, Melis, and Toma-sello (2011a) and Rekers, Haun, and Tomasello (2011) foundthat when chimpanzees were given the choice to obtain foodby collaborating with a partner or acting alone, they mostoften chose to act alone, whereas human children most oftenchose to collaborate.Nevertheless, even though chimpanzees will go and opena door for a necessary partner, they do not actively com-municate about the collaboration much or at all. In the wild,chimpanzees do vocalize their excitement at various pointsthroughout the hunt. But chimpanzee vocalizations, as vir-tually all primate vocalizations, are mostly hardwired to par-ticular stimulus and motivational states, so what is being ex-pressed is general excitement (with the same vocalizationsused when excited about other things) and not anything aboutthe content of what is happening or what the vocalizer wantsto happen. There are no reported vocalizations (or gestures)specifically associated with hunting or coordination. Indeed,in the laboratory, several investigators have reported a strikinglack of communication among chimpanzees as they engagein collaborative tasks (e.g., Melis, Hare, and Tomasello 2009;Povinelli and O’Neil 2000), including in tasks in which theyhad previously communicated with humans (Hirata and Fuwa2007).This overall picture may be clearly seen in a recent exper-iment constructed as a Stag Hunt for pairs of chimpanzees(Bullinger et al. 2011b). Each individual had access to a lesspreferred “hare” food, which she would lose for good if sheleft it. Then a highly preferred “stag” food appeared thatrequired the pair to work together for access (which theyknew from previous experience). Because of the risk involved,communicating with the partner, or at least checking on thepartner before forsaking the hare in hand, would seem to becalled for. But what chimpanzees did in this situation wasalmost always bolt for the stag (90% of the time when apartner was present) without communicating or checking,presumably optimistic that the partner would be coming also(leader-follower strategy). They did this even in a conditionin which they could not see what the partner was doing unlessthey looked around a barrier (which they did not do). If anindividual arrived at the stag first, she sometimes banged onthings to induce the other to join her, but there was no com-munication or systematic checking of the partner ahead oftime as a way of coordinating their decisions.Humans, in contrast, coordinate and communicate abouttheir decision making in such situations to form a joint goal.To form a joint goal, we must know together that each of ushas the goal of working with the other (Bratman 1992). Know-ing together means engaging in some form of recursive mindreading (we each know that the other knows, etc.), which isthe basic cognitive ability that enables humans to engage inall forms of joint and collective intentionality (Tomasello2008, 2009), including joint attention, common conceptualground, and all “public” knowledge and activities. And oncethey have formed a joint goal, humans are committed to it.Thus, when their collaborative partner stops interacting withthem, even 18-month-old infants expect her to be committed,and so they attempt in various ways to reengage her—asopposed to human-raised chimpanzees, who do not (War-neken, Chen, and Tomasello 2006). Slightly older childrenunderstand and respect their own commitment, such that theykeep pursuing the joint goal until both partners have receivedtheir reward even if they have already received theirs (Ha-mann, Warneken, and Tomasello 2012)—which, again, is nottrue of chimpanzees (Greenberg et al. 2010). And when 3-year-olds need to break away from a joint commitment witha partner, they even “take leave” through some form of im-plicit or explicit communication—as a way of acknowledgingand asking to be excused for breaking the commitment (Gra¨-fenhain et al. 2009).Young children also understand the role of the partner inthe collaborative activity in a way that chimpanzees do not,and they communicate about roles as well. Thus, when theyare forced to switch roles in a collaborative activity, youngchildren already know what to do from having observed theirpartner earlier from the “other side” of the collaboration—whereas chimpanzees seemingly do not (Tomasello and Car-penter 2005). And even prelinguistic children communicatewith others to help them play their role in a joint activity,for example, by using a pointing gesture to direct them tothe part of an apparatus they should be acting on—whereas,once more, human-raised chimpanzees do not (Warneken,Chen, and Tomasello 2006; and of course human adults com-municate about their collaboration with language). One pos-sible explanation for this different understanding of the rolesin the collaborative activity is that humans, but not chim-panzees, comprehend joint activities and their different rolesfrom a bird’s-eye view in which all roles are interchangeable,that is, conceptualized in an agent-neutral manner in a singlerepresentational format. This conceptual organization enableseverything from bidirectional linguistic conventions to socialThis content downloaded from 128.243.002.141 on January 25, 2016 04:25:49 AMAll use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).678 Current Anthropology Volume 53, Number 6, December 2012institutions with their publicly created joint goals and indi-vidual roles that can in principle be filled by anyone.This brings us again to the evolutionary question. How didearly humans move from a chimpanzee mode of initiatingand coordinating Stag Hunt activities—based either on aleader-follower strategy or on a kind of naive optimism aboutthe other’s actions—to the modern human mode in whichindividuals coordinate their decision making through somekind of implicit or explicit communication, resulting in a jointcommitment to follow through until everyone gets their re-ward, with a coordination of interchangeable, agent-neutralroles?The main thing to note is that, given the normal feedingecology of chimpanzees, their approach to Stag Hunt situa-tions makes immanently good sense—and indeed is success-ful. Their main food sources are fruits and other vegetation,and monkeys are an addition. A chimpanzee on its way to afig tree is sacrificing only a small amount of time and energyto participate in an unsuccessful monkey hunt.2 With humans,the hypothesis is that at some point their scavenging turnedinto active collaborative hunting and gathering (perhaps withthe emergence of Homo heidelbergensis some 800 kya (thou-sand years ago; Dubreuil 2010), with evidence for bringinglarge prey back to a home base from at least 400–200 kya(Stiner, Barkai, and Gopher 2009). The key point in the tran-sition from chimpanzees, from a psychological point of view,would have been when the decision making became morechallenging, in particular when the risk became such that justoptimistically leaving the hare in hand (as chimpanzees seem-ingly do) was no longer an effective strategy. That is to say,the situation was such that giving up the hare was no longerso cheap that one should just go for the stag without at-tempting to coordinate decisions with other potential hunters.As in the case of sharing the spoils, social selection basedon reputation almost certainly played a role in all of this aswell—but in this case, not for individuals who were tolerantaround food and fair at sharing the spoils but rather forcompetent coordinators and communicators who would in-crease the likelihood of success. Clearly, humans’ skills ofcoordination and communication increased continuously af-ter their initial emergence—from pointing and pantomimingto conventional languages—and the hypothesis is simply thatbetter coordinators and communicators were chosen as col-laborative partners more often. In general, as humans wentfrom more passive scavenging to more active collaborativeforaging, they were faced with ever more challenging coor-dination situations and decisions, and this provided the se-lective context for the evolution of ever greater skills of co-ordination and communication.2. This may help to explain the surprising fact that chimpanzees huntmore frequently for monkeys in the rainy season, when their fruit andother options are actually more plentiful (perhaps because the cost ofunsuccessful monkey hunting is lower; Watts and Mitani 2002).Temptations to Free RideIn Stag Hunt situations with no excess of labor available (allindividuals present are needed for success), free riding is notpossible: if I do not participate, then I (and everyone else)get nothing. The proposal is thus that the earliest manifes-tations of human collaborative foraging were not so vulner-able to free riding because they involved very small numbersof collaborators, each of whom believed their participationto be necessary. Interestingly, contemporary children seem tohave virtually no interest in free riding, as participating incollaborations seems to be rewarding in itself (Gra¨fenhain etal. 2009).So how does it work in chimpanzee hunting of monkeys,when there are often excess participants around? As notedabove, the main factor in acquiring meat in chimpanzee huntsis being the captor. But, in addition, Boesch (1994) reportsthat individuals get more meat when they are actually in thehunt than if they are either bystanders or latecomers to theparty—suggesting the possibility that meat is divided basedon participation. But bystanders still get plenty of meat (83%of bystanders in Taı¨ get at least some meat), and they getmore than latecomers. This suggests that the main variablein obtaining meat is proximity to the kill at the key moment,with the captor getting most, those in the immediate vicinitygetting next most, and latecomers getting least—a hypothesisreceiving strong support from a recent experiment (Melis etal. 2011b). Boesch also reports that of the hunters who arenot captors, the one who obtains the most meat is the onewho best anticipates the monkey’s escape route—but theytend to be both close to the kill site and also older individualswho command more meat in general. Interestingly, inBoesch’s (1994) similar analysis of the hunting of the Gombechimpanzees, bystanders actually get more meat than hunters.So, overall, hunting chimpanzees would seem to have eitherno, or very poor, mechanisms for controlling free riders, lead-ing Boesch (1994:660) to ask: “Why do so many individualscheat, and why are they so readily accepted by hunters?”Another interesting situation is that the individual whobegins chasing the monkey is not the one most likely to cap-ture it (Boesch 1994). This could easily undermine groupaction altogether, as each individual lags to avoid being thefirst chaser. But it does not, and this is instructive of theprocess. The key is that at least one individual would ratherbe the dispreferred first chaser than for there to be no huntat all. That is, some individual must reason that if I do notact soon, no one will get anything—and I would prefer toget something, even if it is less than maximal (and even asmall amount of meat is valuable because it contains vitalmicronutrients; Tennie, Gilby, and Mundry 2009b). In gametheory, this is the Snowdrift situation, with as many equilibriaas participants who reason in this way. Interestingly, in theTaı¨ chimpanzees, it is most often youngsters who begin thechase, perhaps because they have yet to learn that the firstchaser is disadvantaged (whereas the older individuals knowThis content downloaded from 128.243.002.141 on January 25, 2016 04:25:49 AMAll use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).Tomasello et al. Interdependence Hypothesis 679this, and so lag a bit). But it also might be because youngstersare typically more impulsive, impatient, and risk prone thanare adults.So what do humans do about free riders? The answer is,of course, social selection by means of reputation. Humanshave evolved extremely sensitive cheater-detection mecha-nisms of a type never observed in chimpanzees or other greatapes (no studies have investigated apes’ partner choice withrespect to free riders)—which lead them not only to shunfree riders but sometimes even to punish them (Cosmides1989). Because everyone knows this to be the case, individualsare very concerned that others not think them to be laggards,and so they have developed a concern for self-reputation,something also never observed in other great apes. Manyexperiments clearly demonstrate that humans’ concern fortheir own reputation is an important incentive for coopera-tion in many situations in which free riding would otherwisebe beneficial (Milinski, Semmann, and Krambeck 2002). Ingeneral, to the degree that collaborative foraging becomesobligate for survival, a reputation as a good collaborativepartner becomes obligate as well.A mechanism related to reputation and self-reputation ispunishment. So far we have simply assumed that individualschoose partners with good reputations and avoid those withbad reputations. But there is also the possibility of punishingthose who do not cooperate (or rewarding those who do),presumably both to encourage their cooperation on the spotand also to improve their behavior for future collaborations—and indeed such punishment has been shown to be effectivein helping to enforce cooperation in various economic games(Boyd 2006). Humans sometimes even mete out third-partypunishment against those harming others (when they them-selves are not being harmed), whereas chimpanzees—eventhough they retaliate against those who harm them directly(Jensen, Call, and Tomasello 2007b)—do not (Riedl et al.2012).3 When humans are punishing a noncooperator, theytypically experience resentment or moral anger, which goesbeyond normal anger because it seems justified.And so, lagging or free riding would not have been muchof a problem for early humans foraging together in pairs ortrios, where the participation of all is necessary for successand where lack of participation would be easily noted andcount against reputation. When the collaboration is obligate,the stakes are raised to the degree that there may be evencompetition for partners, and in this case a concern for self-reputation would be especially important. Note that by thispoint, reputation means both (i) a more motivated collabo-rator who will not cheat either by monopolizing the food orby lagging and (ii) a more skillful collaborator who is betterable to form joint goals and coordinate roles. What enables3. Chimpanzees sometimes intervene in the fights of others (so-calledpolicing; Flack et al. 2006). However, they are not in these interventionspunishing particular individuals for bad behavior, but only attemptingto keep a dangerous (for them) situation of conflict from escalating.good collaborators to find one another is thus not reputationfor altruism or anything else external, but simply reputationfor being a good collaborator—which is, with actual partnersand direct observers, impossible to fake.Interdependence and Altruistic HelpingHelping one’s partner during a mutualistic collaborative ac-tivity pays direct dividends. If my partner has dropped orbroken his spear, it is in my interest to help him to find orrepair it, as this will improve our chances for success towardour joint goal (and he has no incentive to now suddenlydefect, as the mutualistic situation is still operative). Mutu-alistic collaboration thus provides a safe context within whichbasic tendencies to help others could evolve (see Silk 2009).It is thus not surprising that when Ache foragers are hunting,they do such things for their partners as give them weapons,clear trails for them, carry their child, repair their weapon,instruct them in best techniques, and so on (Hill 2002). In-terestingly, young children, but not chimpanzees, help othersmore readily in the context of collaborative activities thanoutside of such activities (Greenberg et al. 2010; Hamann,Warneken, and Tomasello 2012).But humans help one another outside of collaborative ac-tivities as well. Indeed, in experimental settings, infants asyoung as 14 months of age will help adults with all kinds ofproblems, from fetching out-of-reach objects to openingdoors to stacking books (Warneken and Tomasello 2006,2007). Perhaps surprisingly, chimpanzees also help conspe-cifics with their problems in some similar ways (Melis et al.2011b; Warneken et al. 2007). But humans would seem to doit much more frequently and in a much wider array of con-texts, including actively sharing resources and informationmore freely (e.g., informing others of things helpfully andeven teaching them things; see Warneken and Tomasello 2009for a review). Why might this be the case?Our proposal is that obligate collaborative foraging pro-duces interdependence among members of a group, and thisinterdependence makes it in my direct interest to help otherswho might be my future partners. If I can acquire food onlywith the help of a partner, then when potential partners arein trouble, I should help them—even outside of any collab-orative activity. The logic is exactly the same as Hamilton’sequation for kin, as worked out by Roberts (2005) in hisStakeholder model: I should sacrifice to help potential part-ners whensB 1 C.In this equation, as in Hamilton’s, B represents ultimate re-productive benefits, and these must exceed costs, C, when thebenefits are conditioned by the stake, s, I have in the particularpartner (analogous to Hamilton’s coefficient of relatedness).The variable s in the case of collaborative foraging simplyrepresents how important it is for me that an individual cur-rently in trouble be alive and well and ready to collaborateThis content downloaded from 128.243.002.141 on January 25, 2016 04:25:49 AMAll use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).680 Current Anthropology Volume 53, Number 6, December 2012with me in the future.4 To be a bit fanciful, if a particularindividual’s survival will lead to me to be successful in for-aging to the tune of 1.3 more offspring in the future (e.g.,because it will help me to live longer), then it will pay forme to sacrifice for her to the tune of 1.2 fewer offspring forme in the future. The same logic holds for many other be-haviors in social groups, of course, so that if an alarm callerbenefits my reproductive fitness, I should help her whenneeded. Clutton-Brock (2002) proposes a generalized versionof this mechanism called group augmentation: if my pros-perity depends on my social group (for defense against pred-ators, etc.), then it is in my interest to keep them alive andprosperous as well.The process is, then, a form of social selection: I help otherswho do things that benefit me (more than my help costs me).But the scenario we are proposing here is special. It is specialbecause if I have a stake in an alarm caller and so help her,then what I am socially selecting for is better alarm callers(who have keen perception, loud vocalizations, etc.). Butwhen the target domain is collaboration, then what is beingsocially selected for is good collaborators—who are tolerantof others in cofeeding situations, skillful at coordination andcommunication, have a tendency to shun or punish free rid-ers, help their partners, and so on.Of course, this account still has a problem of free ridingbecause one can lag on the helping: my highest preference isthat someone else help my potential collaborative partner oralarm-calling groupmate so that I do not have to bear thecosts. But as Zahavi (2003) points out, the same is true ofkin selection: it is in my interest to help my sibling becausehe shares my genes, but my first preference is that someoneelse help him so that I do not have to bear the costs. Thepoint is not that interdependence as described by the Stake-holder model solves the problem of altruism but that, usingthe same logic as kin selection, it changes the math becausemy selfish benefits depend on the well-being of selected others.Obligate collaborative foraging thus creates a logic of in-terdependence, which leads to the selective helping of thosewho will be needed as collaborative partners in the future. Itis noteworthy that whereas almost all other accounts of theevolution of human altruism rest on one or another form ofreciprocity, reciprocity cannot explain uncontingent acts ofaltruistic helping. The current account, in contrast, does notdepend on reciprocity because I am repaid for my altruisticacts not by reciprocated altruistic acts from others, but ratherby their later mutualistic collaboration, which costs themnothing (actually benefits them). Indeed, it has recently beendemonstrated experimentally that humans will actually com-pete with one another to be more altruistic so that observers4. The process is thus similar to what has been called pseudoreciprocity(e.g., Bshary and Bergmu¨ller 2008), in which one individual “invests” inanother, who does nothing contingent in return but just what she nor-mally would do in such circumstances.will later choose them to engage in a mutualistic collaboration(Sylwester and Roberts 2010).5SummaryBonobos, gorillas, and orangutans do not collaboratively for-age at all. Only some chimpanzees do so and then in onlyone of their many foraging activities. And the data we havepresented suggest that when chimpanzees do hunt in smallgroups for monkeys, they do this with cognitive and moti-vational mechanisms not specifically evolved for the task, thatis, they somehow manage to be successful quite often in spiteof their tendencies toward dominance in solving food dis-putes. In contrast, humans, as already evident in young chil-dren, have evolved a suite of cognitive and motivational mech-anisms for sharing food cooperatively, coordinating andcommunicating toward joint goals with complementary roles,and engaging in various kinds of reputation-based social se-lection (including a concern for self-reputation as a coop-erator)—what we have called skills and motivations for jointintentionality. They seem evolved for the task. Table 1 sum-marizes the basic mechanisms involved.Our evolutionary story so far has been highly selective. Asnoted at the outset, we have backgrounded the important roleof kinship, as humans evolved more stable reproductive bonds(resulting in an increase in male tolerance), which obviouslyplayed an important role in the attitudes of individuals towardone another in small groups (Chapais 2008). Further in thiscontext, humans also became cooperative breeders, regularlyproviding child care for offspring who were not their own,and this clearly would have affected emotions and motivationsfor collaboration and altruism as well (Hrdy 2009). Mostlikely, both of these processes played a key role in the earlieststages of the story we are telling here, as humans were be-coming more tolerant with one another around food. But, asalso argued at the outset, these kinds of processes, importantas they are, would not help us to explain the more cognitiveaspects of coordinating and communicating toward jointgoals, nor would they explain humans’ tendency to sociallyselect others with regard to their cooperative behaviors. Toexplain these, we need not just prosocial tendencies, but jointintentional skills and motivations for various kinds of col-laboration.And so a big first step in the evolution of uniquely humancooperation is one in which the usual suspects—kin selection,sexual selection, direct reciprocity, and indirect reciprocity—play only minor roles. The heroes of our story are (1) mu-tualistic collaboration and the logic of interdependence and(2) social selection based on reputation as a good collaborator.5. Note that if two thieves are totally interdependent—the first needsthe second to pick the lock, and the second needs the first to crack thesafe—and this is the only way they can get resources for food, then whenthe police question them, there is no Prisoner’s Dilemma. Neither wantsto be set free on his own while the other stays in jail because this wouldmean starvation.This content downloaded from 128.243.002.141 on January 25, 2016 04:25:49 AMAll use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).Tomasello et al.

There was still someway to go to get to human large-group cooperation and itscomplex conventions, norms, and institutions.Second Step: Group-MindednessSmall-scale obligate collaborative foraging would seem to bea stable form of cooperation: it is in the enlightened self-interest of individuals to collaborate well with others and tohelp their collaborative partners. But, apparently, at somepoint it was not stable, as evidenced by the fact that contem-porary humans possess a whole other level of mechanismsfor cooperation, including social conventions, norms (inter-nalized into guilt and shame), and institutions, along with astrong in-group bias. Why did these become necessary?We think there were two, essentially demographic, factors:population growth within groups, and competition betweengroups. These factors probably began playing a role with theemergence of behaviorally modern humans. Thus, Foley andGamble (2009) argue and present evidence (mostly frompaleo- and modern genetics) that in the Middle Pleistocene,hominin groups (characteristic of the first step of our story)had relatively small effective population sizes. In contrast, Hilland Hurtado (2009) argue and present evidence that a tran-sition to larger social groups with central-place foraging—and comprising a hierarchical structure in which “bands”coalesce into “tribes” or “societies”—took place basically withmodern humans and the advent of behavioral modernity (i.e.,at the time of our second step). The result was two new setsof challenges to human cooperators:Large-group coordination: as groups became larger, at leastpartly in competition with other groups, individuals neededto be able to coordinate with relative strangers—while stillknowing that they were from within the group (and so hadthe requisite skills and trustworthiness).Large-group social selection: as groups became larger, againdue partly to competition with other groups, incentives forcooperation diminished (each individual was less needed, andreputational information was more difficult to obtain; Olson1965), so free riding—and even active cheating—proliferatedand needed to be controlled.With these large-group processes, we have pretty much leftthe domain of factors important in the lives of nonhumangreat apes. But still, a comparison of humans’ and great apes’proximate mechanisms for meeting these two challenges isinstructive for the question of origins. Also instructive is thefact that human children do not participate in group-mindedthings such as social norms and institutions until some timeafter they have learned to collaborate effectively with othersin concrete tasks—giving at least some indirect support toour hypothesized evolutionary sequence of collaboration be-fore group-mindedness.Large-Group Coordination: Cultural Practices andGroup IdentificationIf collaboration is the horizontal dimension of human culture,as adults interact with one another for mutual benefit, thencultural transmission is its vertical dimension, as adults passalong things to children across generations. Cultural trans-mission was very likely an important part of human sociallife from the beginning of the genus Homo, as subsistenceactivities became more complex and the use of tools becamemore important. Being a good social learner was thus goodfor individual fitness and, indeed, even chimpanzees andorangutans socially learn from others in ways that create be-havioral traditions that persist across generations (van Schaiket al. 2003; Whiten et al. 1999).But when social groups become larger, and the target ofsocial learning is collaborative activities in which each par-ticipant must have some skills and trustworthiness to be agood partner, a new set of issues arise. The problem for theindividual is to know who has the requisite skills and trust-worthiness and, reciprocally, to make sure that others knowthat I myself possess these qualities.

Contemporary humans havemany diverse ways of doing this, but one can imagine thatthe original ways were mainly behavioral: people who talklike me, prepare food like me, and net fish in the conventionalway—that is, those who share my cultural practices—are verylikely members of my society. And I know that others arescrutinizing my cultural practices in this same manner.Cultural practices are different from behavioral traditionsbecause their practitioners understand them as “shared” inthe group; that is, they understand them as conventional. Wehave all “agreed” to do them in a particular way, even thoughwe all know that there are other ways we could do them. Itis thus common ground in the society that everyone expectseveryone else both to behave in the conventional way and toexpect others to behave in the conventional way (Lewis 1969).Conventions thus require some kind of recursive mindreadingor common ground as the basis of the agreement, and thisbasic ability evolved initially, as argued above, as a skill forforming joint goals and joint attention in collaborative activ-ities.6 Our hypothesis is that because of this cognitive re-quirement, other great apes do not have human-like conven-tions or cultural practices as such (only behavioral traditions;Tomasello 2008, 2011).Conventions generate the conformity characteristic of cul-tural practices because it is in the individual’s interest to dothings the way that others do them so that they can effectivelycoordinate—and this is especially important if one wishes tobe able to coordinate with anyone in the larger society, in-cluding strangers. I can immediately net fish effectively andefficiently with an in-group stranger if we both do it in theconventional way and can expect the partner to do it in theconventional way as well. In this connection, it is interestingthat human children are much more conformist than areother great apes. Thus, two decades of experimental researchhave shown that human children have a much stronger ten-dency than do other apes to copy the actual actions theyobserve (Tennie, Call, and Tomasello 2009a). This tendencyis so strong that both adults and children conform to otherseven when they know better themselves (Asch 1956; Haunand Tomasello 2011; see also Lyons, Young, and Keil 2007,on children’s tendency to overimitate). Most directly, whenindividuals solve some task on their own and then see otherindividuals demonstrating a different solution, apes tend togo with their own experience over the demonstration (Hru-besch, Preuschoft, and van Schaik 2009; Marshall-Pescini and6. Problems with the proper formulation of mutual knowledge andsimilar constructs are well known. Here we simply adopt the terminologyof Clark (1996), “common ground,” to indicate the various forms ofjoint attention, mutual expectations, mutual knowledge, etc.Whiten 2008),7 whereas human children follow the demon-stration.In addition to pressure from growing population sizes toconform to cultural practices, competition with other groupshelped to engender group identification. In the face of groupcompetition, group life in general becomes one big collabo-rative activity, both directly for agonistic conflicts with com-petitor groups and indirectly in competing for resources withcompetitors in the same geographical area. To compete, thesociety as a whole—especially as population increased andthere was increasing division of labor—had to scale up itssmall-scale collaboration to form collective, society-widegoals, plans, and collective knowledge of things in the face ofoutside threats. And individuals again had to help their col-laborative partners for these group enterprises—who at thispoint comprised essentially everyone in the society, includingsome strangers.Under these conditions—within-group population growthand between-group competition—group identification thusbecame critical. Group identification may seem a fuzzy con-cept, but many phenomena confirm its reality, most especially,the many in-group biases that modern humans show (helpingin-group more than out-group members, caring more aboutreputation with in-group than with out-group members, etc.).Even more striking, people feel collective guilt, pride, orshame when some member of their group does somethingespecially praiseworthy or blameworthy—as if they them-selves had done it (see Bennet and Sani 2008 for this phe-nomenon in young children). Although the process may notbe so well understood, the idea is that group identification isa scaled-up version of the “we” intentionality that small-scalegroups of foragers might have experienced previously as theyhunted or gathered collaboratively toward a joint goal. “We”are all in this together and are interdependent with one an-other, as we compete for food with the barbarians from acrossthe river. This psychological attitude may be called group-mindedness—underlain by skills and motivations not just ofjoint intentionality with other individuals in the moment, butof collective intentionality with the society as a whole (Tom-asello and Rakoczy 2003).8As far as we know, great apes do not have this same kindof group identity or group-mindedness. Chimpanzees live inspatially segregated groups and are hostile toward chimpanzeestrangers they meet on their borders. But this hostility is not,7. Whiten, Horner, and de Waal (2005) claimed that in their study,individuals of a chimpanzee group shifted their problem-solving strategyas a result of observing demonstrators. A close inspection of the data,however, shows that this was true of only one individual. Moreover, asubsequent study with a different chimpanzee group failed to replicatethis result (Hopper et al. 2007).8. Interestingly, social psychologists often distinguish two broad typesof group formation in humans: interpersonal interdependence (corre-sponding to our small-group interdependence) and shared identity (cor-responding to our large-group group-mindedness; e.g., Lickel, Schmader,and Spanovic 2007).This content downloaded from 128.243.002.141 on January 25, 2016 04:25:49 AMAll use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).Tomasello et al. Interdependence Hypothesis 683as far as we know, directed at other groups qua groups, basedon their different appearance or behavioral practices.Large-Group Social Selection: Social Norms and InstitutionsCultural practices are thus conventionalizations (standardi-zations) of the small-scale collaborative (and other) activitiesof step 1 humans. Similarly, the acts of social selection bystep 1 humans were also conventionalized, leading, at step 2,to social norms. Social norms are conventionalizations (stan-dardizations) of the specific acts of social judgment that step1 individuals meted out to collaborative partners. Socialnorms are mutual expectations in common ground that peo-ple behave in certain ways, where the expectations are notjust statistical but rather normative, as in you are expectedto do your part (or else!).Social norms have two key aspects. First is their force. Socialnorms have force over human behavior because, first of all,individuals know that to participate effectively in the collab-orative activities of the group, they must conform to thegroup’s ways of doing things. Even young children enter newsituations in their culture looking for “What am I supposedto do here? How do I do it?” (Kalish 1998). In addition, ofcourse, individuals do not want to suffer the consequencesof norm violations in the form of shunning or punishment.These punitive aspects of social selection were already a partof collaborative activities at step 1 of our story, but now, withtheir conventionalization, everyone knows with everyone elsein common ground that conforming to cultural practices andsocial norms is necessary for group coordination—so thatgroup members may view nonconformity in general as po-tentially harmful to group life in general. Moreover, if con-forming to social norms also displays my group identity(which, again, we all know in common ground), my non-conformity expresses my disdain for the opinion of this groupand for being considered a member of this group—whichmakes me potentially dangerous.Social norms can thus channel human behavior quitestrongly in certain directions. The theoretical problem is thatsocial norms can, in principle, channel human behavior inany direction, including group-detrimental directions (Boyd2006). But this potential multidirectionality is only a problemif we envision social norms emerging in a vacuum. In ourview, because of humans’ already existing cooperative lifewaysand interdependence as evolved in step 1, social norms couldnot have emerged as directionally arbitrary, but only as en-couraging collaboration and helping and as discouraging theiropposites—since, to repeat, social norms are nothing morethan conventionalizations of the more particular acts of socialselection for cooperative behavior (and against uncooperativebehavior) of step 1 individuals. Under conditions of groupcompetition, social norms may be scaled up to the level ofsocietal life in general.The second key aspect of social norms is their generality.They are general, first, because they imply an objective stan-dard against which an individual’s behavior is evaluated andjudged. These objective standards come from the fact that weall know in common ground how the different roles in par-ticular cultural practices need to be performed for everyoneto reap the anticipated benefit. Thus, if it is common groundin the group that when collecting honey, the person smokingout the bees must do it in this particular way and that if shedoes not, we will all go home empty-handed, then everyone’sbehavior may be evaluated relative to this mutually knownbehavioral standard. Social norms are general, second, becausethey emanate not from individual opinion but from groupopinion. Thus, if dominance is not an important part of thesocial interaction of the beings we are talking about here, thenthe punishment of the laggard needs to be by the group as awhole—so that when an individual enforces a social norm,she is doing so, in effect, as an emissary of the group as awhole (with even further objectification of the norm comingif the enforcer is supposedly a representative of a deity). Thethird source of generality of social norms is that the groupdisapproval involved is aimed in an agent-neutral way at, inprinciple, all individuals equally (including the self), that is,all who know with us in common ground the social normand identify with our group’s lifeways. Social norms are thusgroup expectations and judgments, with respect to group-known standards, that all group members mutually expectone another to respect.9It is thus easy to see why people follow social norms—following social norms coordinates their behavior with thenormative expectations of the group so as to collaborate betterand avoid punishment and/or shunning. But the reason whypeople enforce social norms is not as straightforward. Onereason is again a natural tendency to want to help and protectone’s collaborative partners and, in the spirit of group-mind-edness, the smooth functioning of the group. When we enterinto a joint commitment to a social norm, group-mindedthinking means that we commit not only to follow it but tosee that others do too—for the benefit of both ourselves andthose with whom we are interdependent (Gilbert 1989). Thus,when 3-year-old children observe someone doing somethingthat violates a previously established conventional norm, theyoften object, using normative language about what peopleshould or ought to be doing (Rakoczy, Warneken, and Tom-asello 2008). Nonconformists are not doing things the waythat “we” in this group do them, and this is, in a sense, athreat to our group.Nevertheless, there is still the problem that punishing otherson behalf of the group is costly and risky, and so there is theproblem of free riding: why not let someone else do it? Onesolution would be to punish those who do not punish othersas they should. This, of course, leads to an infinite regress iffollowed to its logical conclusion: individuals punishing non-9. The common-ground assumption exempts from the force of oursocial norms individuals from another social group, young children, ormentally incompetent persons.This content downloaded from 128.243.002.141 on January 25, 2016 04:25:49 AMAll use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).684 Current Anthropology Volume 53, Number 6, December 2012punishers of nonpunishers, and so forth. And this is wheresocial norms help: recent mathematical models show thatwhen it is a group that is punishing, costs to the individualpunisher may be negligible (Boyd, Gintis, and Bowles 2010).Another part of the solution is that we do not sanction peoplewho fail to enforce norms in the same way that we sanctionnorm violators themselves. If you see me trying to steal somehoney, you will either try to stop me or punish me. But if athird person watches you not trying to stop me or punishme, her attitude toward you, the nonenforcer, while negative,is not nearly so severe—and may not call for punishment atall. In the model of Ellickson (2001), we punish norm vio-lators, but we simply avoid or shun nonpunishers, which ispotentially cost free (a mathematical treatment of the problemthat goes in this general direction is presented by Pancha-nathan and Boyd 2004).Moreover, in practice, enforcing social norms is mostly notnecessary because individuals have already internalized themand naturally want to conform to them. And if individualsdo violate a norm, they often punish themselves. Thus, if, ina moment of weakness, I take some honey that is needed byothers, I will very likely feel guilty. The feeling of guilt is akind of self-punishment that functions to prevent me fromdoing it again in the future, lessening the chances of actualpunishment (or shunning) from others. In addition, display-ing guilt to others, if caught, signals that I know the norm,that I know I should have followed it, and that I am punishingmyself for its violation already (hopefully evoking your em-pathy)—which all means that I am indeed a cooperative groupmember and norm-follower who just had a momentary lapse(see Vaish, Carpenter, and Tomasello 2011 for evidence thateven young children prefer individuals who display guilt fortheir transgressions). Shame is not bound up with harm inthe same way as guilt, but it is also a form of self-punishment(Fessler 2004 emphasizes its appeasement function). I amashamed that I wore the wrong clothing to the wedding, andmy blushing displays that I know the norm and that I shouldhave followed it, so you don’t have to shun or punish me,and you can trust me to do better in the future.Guilt, shame, and pride are thus internalized versions of thekind of moral indignation and approbation that humans meteout to others who violate social norms. These norm-relatedemotions thus demonstrate with special clarity that the judg-ment being made is not my personal feeling about things butrather the group’s. I am sanctioning myself or praising myselfas an emissary of the group. I stole the honey because I wantedit, and I still like having it, but I feel guilty. I, as a representativeof the group’s values, am judging myself, as an individual,negatively. It is almost certainly the case that the individuals ofno other animal species judge and evaluate themselves in thisway. And, as noted above, collective guilt and pride for thegroup (based on the behavior of individuals as representativesof the group) are perforce uniquely human as well.Pretty much all of the cooperative mechanisms character-istic of humans at this second step in our evolutionary storycome together in the creation of social institutions. Socialinstitutions are collaborative cultural practices with joint goalsand standardized roles, with social norms governing how re-wards are dispensed, how cheaters and free riders are treated,and so on. What is new about institutions is that they createnew statuses for individuals playing particular roles that ev-eryone must respect; for example, we give individuals therights and obligations to be group “chief,” and we give “po-lice” the rights and obligations necessary to keep within-grouppeace. These new statuses exist because and only becauseeveryone agrees in common ground that they do; becauseinstitutions are especially clearly public, no one may ignorethe new statuses by pleading ignorance of them (Chwe 2003).These status functions (as Searle 1995 calls them) are essen-tially entitlements: the group has, in essence, agreed that anindividual can and indeed should do certain specified thingsimmune from punishment via “normal” social norms. Thesestatuses are typically symbolically marked with all kinds ofofficial markers, and their ontological status is prefigured on-togenetically in young children pretending socially that, forexample, this stick is a bird that can fly through the air as itpleases (Rakoczy and Tomasello 2007).SummaryThe dynamics of small-scale collaboration worked fine forforaging in dyads and triads of the moment. But as groupsbecame larger, eventually turning into tribal societies, andgroups started competing with one another for resources, newchallenges to cooperation arose. The solution was a suite ofnew proximate mechanisms that we may summarize with theterm “group-mindedness.” Behavioral traditions were con-ventionalized into cultural practices that everyone knew andthat everyone expected everyone else to know and conformto, which facilitated individuals’ coordination with in-groupstrangers. Social selection was conventionalized into group-wide social norms, which were also part of the commonground of the group, as was the group-wide obligation toenforce these norms. People used conformity to the culturalpractices and social norms of the society as markers of groupidentity, and everyone favored and trusted members of theirown society over others, especially as group competitionheightened. The result was a new kind of interdependenceand group-mindedness that went well beyond the joint in-tentionality of small-scale cooperation to a kind of collectiveintentionality at the level of the entire societal, that is, cultural,group (Tomasello and Rakoczy 2003). Interestingly and im-portantly, young children do not begin to show this kind ofgroup-mindedness and collective intentionality—in particu-lar, they do not enforce social norms on others—until after3 years of age, which is considerably after they are capable ofcollaborating with other individuals toward joint goals, as instep 1 of our story (Rakoczy, Warneken, and Tomasello 2008).Cultural group selection may have played an importantrole at this point as well, as some groups created culturalThis content downloaded from 128.243.002.141 on January 25, 2016 04:25:49 AMAll use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).Tomasello et al.

But, as noted at the outset, cultural group selectionexplains why the particular social norms and institutions ofparticular cultural groups prevailed, and this assumes species-universal skills and motivations for creating social norms andinstitutions in the first place. We thus view cultural groupselection as a critically important component in the processleading to modern human cooperation in large-scale societies,but only fairly late in the process, that is, after our secondstep, in which human groups began their truly cultural lifein larger societies. In any case, a summary of the specificproximate mechanisms and group processes involved in step2 of our account, and some of their possible evolutionaryprecursors in other great apes, is presented in table 2.ConclusionModern theories of the evolution of human cooperation tendto focus either on small-scale cooperation early in humanevolution or on group-level cooperation later in the processwith the advent of modern humans (or even later, with ag-riculture). We believe, however, that the full story will requirean account that incorporates both of these levels and evo-lutionary periods.Small-group collaboration, in our account, is not solelyabout kinship and reciprocity, as in most accounts, thoughthese undoubtedly played some role. Kinship and reciprocityare important in the lives of almost all primates, so if theywere the whole story, it would be hard to see how humanscame to their distinctive lifeways and social organization. Kin-ship and reciprocity do not get you culture. Instead, we havehypothesized a change of ecology that led humans to an in-terdependent lifestyle, especially collaborative foraging, whichresulted in the evolution of new skills and motivations forcollaborating with others (joint intentionality) and gave in-dividuals special incentives for helping their partners altru-istically as well. The emergence of more stable reproductivebonds and cooperative breeding undoubtedly played impor-tant roles in the emotional-motivational side of things at thisearly period as well, but contrary to what is implied by Burkartand van Schaik (2010), we do not believe that if chimpanzeesbecame cooperative breeders that human-like social-cognitiveskills and shared intentionality would automatically result.What is needed, in addition, is new cognitive challenges suchas those presented by collaborative foraging: the need to co-ordinate with others toward joint goals, the need to masterwith others complex skills and technologies, and the need tocommunicate these skills and technologies to others withinand across generations. In our view, cooperative child carefits in very well with a lifestyle of collaborative foraging, sothe cooperative breeding and cooperative foraging accountsgo very well together.Group-level cooperation was then built upon the cognitiveand motivational foundations of small-scale collaboration.Creating cultural conventions, norms, and institutions at thelevel of the social group as a whole requires a new way ofthinking in which there is a “we” that constitutes not just mycurrent partners in a collaborative enterprise but all of us inthis society. This new way of thinking—that we are a “we”—very likely evolved in response to group competition, as eachgroup had to “circle its wagons.” Group-mindedness thusrelies on a kind of collective intentionality in which all mem-bers of the group participate, both following and enforcingthe norms that define the group and stabilize its cooperativeactivities. At this point, cultural group selection undoubtedlyplayed an important role as well. But it could play that roleonly after humans had evolved the kind of group-mindednessthat is the mark of human cultural organization in the firstplace. Thus, cultural group selection cannot help us muchwith the cognitive dimension of human collaboration—whichat this level means the creation of cultural conventions,norms, and institutions—which is the target of cultural groupselection, not its creation.And so, for us, it is all about the evolution of a distinctivelynew, un-chimp-like lifestyle that required both emotional-motivational and cognitive adaptations. The key ecologicalchange was one that made individual human beings inter-dependent with one another for subsistence, which led nat-urally to helping those on whom one was dependent. Thisrequired the development of cognitive skills for putting one’shead together with others in acts of mutualistic collaborationand communication. It also required individuals suppressingcertain selfish tendencies, for example, for hogging all thespoils or for free riding on the efforts of others.

Inorder to be chosen, one needs to appear to others to be agood partner, and the best way to do that is to actually be agood partner—which means good cognitive skills for coor-dination and communication, sharing the spoils peacefullywith others, shunning and punishing noncooperators, con-cerns for self-reputation as a cooperator, and so forth. Thislogic of interdependence and resulting social selection scalesup to the level of the whole society if all of its members areinterdependent because they are in competition with othergroups and so have become group-minded.This account is, of course, speculative. Ethnographies ofmodern-day foragers may not be representative of the earlierperiods in human evolution in which we are interested, andthe paleo-anthropological record is far from definitive on anyof the important issues. We have thus supplemented these tra-ditional anthropological forms of evidence with comparativeexperimental data on similarities and differences in the skillsand motivations for cooperation between contemporary hu-man children and other great apes. Here the data are quiteclear that contemporary humans have some specific skills andmotivations for collaboration and cooperative communicationnot possessed by other great apes, at least not in the same way.And, importantly, these can be theoretically connected to thespecific challenges presented by collaborative foraging—as rep-resented by the Stag Hunt from game theory—which providesfurther evidence for collaborative foraging as a key context forthe evolution of uniquely human skills and motivations forcooperation and shared intentionality.In any case, what the current account makes abundantlyclear is just how difficult it is to establish and maintain co-operation in complex social organisms. Humans have all kindsof species-unique skills and motivations specifically designedto support cooperation, but still we are very, very far fromperfect cooperators. Cooperation is really difficult.AcknowledgmentWe thank Anna-Claire Schneider for her help with this paper.CommentsIan C.

(ian.gilby@duke.edu). 16 V 12I applaud Tomasello et al. for highlighting the role of mu-tualism in the evolution of human cooperation. In chimpan-zees and bonobos, which often serve as models of the lastcommon ancestor of apes and humans, the importance ofmutualism is often overlooked in favor of altruism-basedmechanisms common in the genus Homo. Mutualism explainsthe majority of non-kin cooperation in the animal kingdom(Dugatkin 1997); therefore, it is critical to understand its rolein the development of the uniquely high levels of cooperationin humans. With this said, I must make it clear that I am notarguing that altruism-based cooperation is entirely absent innonhuman primates. Indeed, several studies have providedexperimental and correlational evidence for reciprocal ex-change, albeit typically characterized by short delays and lowcosts (Clutton-Brock 2009). However, I feel that mutualisticexplanations for cooperation in chimpanzees and bonoboshave not received research attention in proportion to theirbiological importance.I study hunting and meat-sharing among wild chimpanzeesin two East African communities—Kasekela (Gombe NationalPark, Tanzania) and Kanyawara (Kibale National Park,Uganda), and I would like to echo the authors’ emphasis onthe mutualistic nature of group hunts of red colobus monkeysat these sites. In fact, I argue that group hunting by chim-panzees may be even simpler than Tomasello et al. claim.They use the game-theoretical model of the Stag Hunt as atool for understanding chimpanzee hunting. In the most im-portant respect, this is a valid approach—as the number ofhunters increases, each individual has a greater chance ofobtaining meat. Thus, there is selection on the individual toparticipate, as long as others are already doing so. However,Tomasello et al. point out that the Stag Hunt hinges on theassumption that “all solo alternatives must be forsaken(risked) in order to collaborate,” which is clearly not the casein a chimpanzee hunt. The alternative prey (vegetation) re-mains a viable option if a hunt fails. In fact, the existence ofa high-quality alternative food source (ripe drupe fruits) in-creases hunting probability at Kanyawara, even after the con-comitant occurrence of large groups is controlled for (Gilbyand Wrangham 2007). Thus, it would seem that the costs ofhunting (at least with regard to missed alternative foragingopportunities) are negligible.As an alternative to the Stag Hunt, Richard Wrangham,Richard Connor, and I have argued that group hunting bychimpanzees may be driven by a simple by-product mutu-alism (Gilby and Connor 2010; Gilby, Eberly, and Wrangham2008) by which each individual’s selfish actions incidentallybenefit others (Brown 1983). Each male hunts for himself butexperiences an increased chance of success when others hunt.There is growing evidence that certain males act as huntingcatalysts by being the first to act. At both Kanyawara (Gilby,Eberly, and Wrangham 2008) and Gombe (Gilby, Pusey, andWilson, forthcoming), hunts were significantly more likely tooccur if at least one of two particular males was present whena party encountered red colobus than if both were absent.This suggests that once one of these “impact males” beginshunting, the prey’s defenses are compromised, reducing thepotential costs for other hunters.This content downloaded from 128.243.002.141 on January 25, 2016 04:25:49 AMAll use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).Tomasello et al. Interdependence Hypothesis 687Given this evidence in favor of by-product mutualism, Ienthusiastically agree with Tomasello et al. that group huntingby chimpanzees may arise as “an emergent property generatedby individual decision making not aimed at . . . coordination.”I am also particularly pleased at their observation that indi-vidual decision making does not mean that hunting is a madscramble during which all hunters ignore each other. Instead,“in deciding what to do, each participant takes into accountthe position of the others and their behavior, and how thesemight influence the monkey’s flight”—that is, a by-productmutualism may result in differentiated roles (as described atTaı¨ [Boesch 2002]), without involving shared goals and in-tentions.Nevertheless, chimpanzee hunting is probably not as simpleas I have made it out to be in this comment. For example,it is becoming clear that above a certain threshold numberof hunters, when bystanders obtain meat at predictably highrates, individuals refrain from hunting (Gilby, Eberly, andWrangham 2008). This suggests that receiving meat in anyamount is beneficial, probably due to concentrated micro-nutrients (Tennie, Gilby, and Mundry 2009b). Therefore, agreater understanding of the nutritional benefits of meat forchimpanzees will be critical for unraveling the complex dy-namics of group-level foraging in humans’ closest living rel-atives.In sum, while we differ on some of the finer points, Iapplaud the authors’ two-step scenario of the evolution ofhuman cooperation. Their invocation of mutualism in thecontext of cooperative foraging as a step toward altruism-based human cooperation is compelling.Kristen HawkesDepartment of Anthropology, University of Utah, 270 South 1400East, Salt Lake City, Utah 84112, U.S.A. (hawkes@anthro.utah.edu). 29 V 12Stag Hunts or Rearing Environments?Tomasello et al. have made the case that shared intentionalitydistinguishes humans from our nearest living relatives. Whataccounts for the difference? The answer they offer is Stag Huntchoices faced by ancestral foragers. Noting problems with thatanswer, I urge attention to a promising alternative stimulatedby Tomasello et al.’s own findings. It comes from Sarah Hrdy,who posed the question, “Why us and not them?” The answershe nominated is distinctive rearing environments in our lin-eage, with consequences for selection on motives and capac-ities for social engagement at the youngest ages.Tomasello and his collaborators have produced an extensivebody of results from experiments with chimpanzees and hu-man children, demonstrating that very young—even pre-verbal—children display an eagerness for social engagementnot found in our nearest living relatives. As indicated in thepaper here, the experimental evidence gets richer all the time.Building on this and a long history of findings in social phi-losophy and developmental psychology, Tomasello et al. havehypothesized that the evolution of shared intentionality wasa crucial antecedent to human language and the socially con-structed worlds in which we live our cultural lives.If shared intentionality is key to so much, explanations forit become especially important. Here and elsewhere, the ex-planation Tomasello et al. favor is the Stag Hunt. This parableis an assurance game in which cooperation is easily achievedbecause players take the risk of abandoning pursuit of a harethey could capture alone in anticipation of the greater benefitfrom capturing a stag by cooperating (but see Brosnan et al.2011). Here Tomasello and colleagues argue that chimpanzeepursuit of monkeys may also fit the Stag Hunt. But does it?When a chimpanzee leaves a fig tree to join a monkey hunt,the figs don’t run away. Stag-versus-hare alternatives are notobvious for ancestral hominin foragers either. The authorssay the parable “can easily be extended to other foragingactivities, including many gathering activities,” but they donot elaborate. Their examples are big-game hunting in themiddle Pleistocene and scavenging—competitive and pas-sive—before that. Behavior presumed in these cases is barelysketched—perhaps because the exercise is a thought experi-ment. Still, a thought experiment should specify imaginedalternatives. The parable is not a good fit for solitary big-game hunting among living foragers in the arid African tropics(e.g., Hawkes, O’Connell, and Blurton-Jones 2001). Moderntechnology (bows and arrows) likely alters payoffs but doesnot prevent useful application of ethnographic lessons to thehunting and competitive scavenging past (O’Connell et al.2002). As for passive scavenging, where is the stag when theusual gain is only cranial contents and bone marrow thatcan’t run away?Focus on Stag Hunts leaves no space for Hrdy’s (2009)cooperative breeding hypothesis. Although it is mentioned inpassing, her specific arguments about ancestral rearing en-vironments and the evolution of shared intentionality are not.Findings from Tomasello’s own group about the sociality ofvery young children play an important role in her synthesis.Because human mothers, unlike other apes, depend on helpersin child rearing, they have next babies before the previousone is independent. That means maternal concern about thenew infant trades off with concern about potential helpersand other still-dependent offspring. So, human infants, unlikeother apes, cannot count on their mother’s undivided atten-tion. In this rearing environment, the welfare of infants andyoungsters depends heavily on their own ability to engage thecommitment of mothers and others, with selection for thosecapacities especially strong in high-mortality environments.A contender to explain the origin of these rearing envi-ronments is the grandmother hypothesis, favored because itaccounts for distinctive human postmenopausal longevity,later maturity, and shorter birth intervals compared to theother great apes (Blurton Jones, Hawkes, and O’Connell 1999;This content downloaded from 128.243.002.141 on January 25, 2016 04:25:49 AMAll use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).688 Current Anthropology Volume 53, Number 6, December 2012Hawkes 2003; Hawkes et al. 1998; O’Connell, Hawkes, andBlurton Jones 1999). Hrdy’s cooperative breeding hypothesis(2009) casts its comparative net much wider than the apesand does not privilege grandmothers among possible helpers.But most important here is that Hrdy points to selectionpressures on infant sociality that arise from the challengesposed by maternal reliance on help from whatever source.Tomasello and colleagues give indirect support to the priorimportance of rearing environments for our prosociality bysuggesting that developmental timing may be a guide to evo-lutionary sequence. Their own evidence shows distinctive hu-man appetites for mutual orientation and joint activities inchildren much too young to forage—collaboratively or oth-erwise. The early appearance of these motivations and ca-pacities suggests they are adaptations to challenges faced atthose early ages. That developmental timing is directly con-sistent with Hrdy’s proposal that distinctive human proso-ciality began initially as a consequence of the rearing envi-ronments that emerged as ancestral mothers relied enoughon help that they bore the next baby before the previous onecould feed itself.Kim SterelnyPhilosophy Program, Research School of the Social Sciences, Aus-tralian National University, 0200 Canberra, Australian Capital Ter-ritory, Australia (kim.sterelny@anu.edu.au). 10 V 12I agree with the core argument of this paper, having developeda similar argument in Sterelny (2007). So my comments high-light differences in emphasis, not different models of humancooperation. That said, I agree that cooperative foraging wasan early-evolving, central factor in the human cooperationexplosion, but in coevolutionary interaction with reproduc-tive and informational cooperation, rather than being itsprime driver. Even when we focus on ecological cooperation,mutualistic teamwork complements other factors. Coopera-tion generates benefit in two ways: (i) through collective ac-tion in teamwork, as groups of agents secure resources (orescape dangers) that none could secure by themselves and (ii)through risk management. Dispersed search is more efficientthat a band searching together; variation in return is con-trolled if individuals target different resources. Risk manage-ment is important to those with limited storage, so bet hedg-ing, and division of labor (by sex or age) was probably anearly form of cooperation, coevolving with collective foraging.In the early phase of the cooperation explosion, free-ridercontrol was a more pressing problem than the paper supposes.Collective foraging was never a pure coordination problem.Even if hunting (or bully scavenging) teams were originallyso small that every player was needed, there would still be atemptation to minimize the risk costs of participation; not tobe the player closest to the leopard, banging your stick; ornot to be the first to stab at a wildebeest breaking through acordon. Perhaps more important, there are trade-offs betweenredundancy, reliability, and free-riding opportunities. If everyplayer is needed, it takes only one mistake, failure of nerve,or unlucky moment for the hunt to miscarry. Returns willbe fragile. Redundant players make success more robust butopen free-riding opportunities. Sanctions, perhaps throughpartner choice, must have been available close to the begin-ning of cooperation takeoff. These sanctions were not free:exclusion risks making enemies. That risk is never trivial:forager societies are very cooperative, but with very high ratesof interpersonal violence (Seabright 2010).The paper somewhat undersells the role of scavenging instep 1. Lions get much of their food by driving other predatorsfrom their kills, and a pack of erectines with crude spears andgood throwing arms could have driven leopards and the likefrom a kill. Predators cannot afford injury, and a leopard(say) guarding a kill is a stationary target for volleys of thrownrocks. Wrangham (2009) argues persuasively that even ha-bilenes show signs of an improved, richer diet. If so, it islikely that increasingly collaborative, increasingly obligate, col-lective foraging had deep roots in increasingly effective, ag-gressive, scavenging packs. Aggressive scavenging is a plausiblepathway to cooperation because its profits are high while itscognitive preconditions are light: the hominin band must staytogether in a dense pack, make as much noise as possible,throw as hard as they can. Scavenging is not passive (as thepaper notes in passing), but it requires no complex coordi-nation or role differentiation.A final comment: step 2 seems to compress two separatetransitions into one. Group-mindedness seems to haveevolved by the later Pleistocene (perhaps by 75 kya), withmaterial symbols and regional style established in the physicalrecord (Henshilwood and Dubreuil 2011). This “symbolicbehavior” is often interpreted as advertising group member-ship and/or individual status, though these issues are notresolved (Sterelny 2011). However, there seem to be two latePleistocene transitions in social, demographic, and economiccomplexity. One is associated with the emergence of behav-iorally modern humans, perhaps by about 75 kya. The otheris at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, with the emergenceof farming and sedentary life. Only at this point do the factorsthe paper emphasizes become central: groups really did be-come large enough so that cooperating with strangers becamea real issue, just at the time that competition between groupsintensified (Seabright 2010). Despite Bowles’s claims to thecontrary, neither his own data nor theory supports the claimthat group-group competition was cutthroat through thePleistocene (Bowles 2009; Kelly 2005). Group-mindednesscomes before large groups.In short, there are some differences in emphasis betweenmy work and that of Tomasello and colleagues, but their corehypothesis is on the money.This content downloaded from 128.243.002.141 on January 25, 2016 04:25:49 AMAll use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).Tomasello et al. Interdependence Hypothesis 689ReplyWe are very grateful for the sympathetic and constructivecritiques of our paper. The divergences of opinion that havearisen are, by and large, a matter of emphasis and detail, ratherthan substantive disagreements. Nevertheless, we appreciatethe opportunity to clarify three key points with regard to (1)the status of the Stag Hunt metaphor, (2) the relation of ourhypothesis to the cooperative breeding hypothesis, and (3)the evolutionary timing of the transition to group-minded-ness.The Stag Hunt as a Model for CooperationThe Stag Hunt model is game-theoretic tool whose intendeduse is metaphorical, rather than literal. And while we do seecollaborative foraging as having played a centrally importantrole in the evolution of human-specific cooperative capacities,the applicability of the model is not restricted to foragingactivities.The Stag Hunt refers to any situation in which multipleindividuals gain payoff benefits from successfully collaborat-ing, these benefits are greater than acting alone, and individ-uals engaged in collaboration sacrifice in some way. Thus,Gilby’s and Hawkes’s point is well taken, that when chim-panzees launch a hunt for a monkey, alternative foragingpotential in the form of vegetation may not be lost. The “soloalternative,” which is lost in this case, may be more akin toan individual’s personal energetic reserves, safety, or time thatmight have been devoted to courtship, mating, or resting.Indeed, the only difference between the Stag Hunt and Gilbyand Connor’s (2010) “by-product mutualism” model of co-operation appears to be simply that an alternative potentialto cooperation is actually specified in the model. Likewise,whatever is represented by the stag in such a situation neednot be mobile prey, or prey at all. For instance, collectivedefense of some scavengeable remains or engagement in col-lective group defense may benefit an individual far beyondan attempt to defend the carcass or themselves in a solo effort.Given that the Stag Hunt is a metaphor for the payoffsentailed in a coordination problem, we agree with Sterelnythat, in addition to collaborative foraging, multiple forms ofcooperation played an important role in contributing some-thing toward a “human cooperative suite” (see Sterelny 2011),including scavenging, reproductive cooperation, and coop-erative breeding (see Chapais 2010; Hrdy 2009). We simplyargue that at an early stage, the benefits of cooperation andthe dynamics of interdependence would have largely back-grounded any potential free-rider problem.Hawkes’s plea for actual examples in addition to hypo-thetical scenarios is also well taken. We envisage that, in smallgroups, targeted hunting of prime adult bovids and cervids,which was well established in the late Pleistocene (but oc-curred also in the middle Pleistocene; Stiner 2002), as well asthe scavenging activities that appear to functionally precedethis, may well have been Stag Hunt–type situations. The sol-itary big-game hunting of many of today’s foragers (e.g.,Hawkes, O’Connell, and Blurton-Jones 2001) does not standin contradiction to this: the Broad Spectrum Revolution overthe past 40,000 years involved a drastic expansion of the hom-inin subsistence base and, critically, the emergence of projec-tile weaponry such as spears, and bows and arrows (Stiner2001). This would have dramatically reduced the risk asso-ciated with any stag-type pursuit. But Stag Hunt problemscontinue to present themselves, even in contemporary for-aging populations: Alvard and Nolin (2002) show, for in-stance, that whale-hunting practices in the Lamelera of In-donesia conform well to such a payoff structure: anindividual’s returns from a collaborative whale hunt are nu-tritionally superior to those attained by solitary fishing, butriskier. Nevertheless, group norms for sharing the spoils hereappear to enable coordination to great success.The Role of Cooperative BreedingHrdy’s cooperative breeding hypothesis (2009) elegantly doc-uments a mechanism by which extramaternal support in earlychild-rearing environments enabled reduced interbirth inter-vals in females and the bearing of offspring with extendeddevelopmental phases. We fully acknowledge the profoundsignificance of such novel breeding environments in perhapsproviding a context for the development of human-specificprosocial emotions and motivations. But we offer two caveats.The first is that it is difficult to see how cooperative breedingalone could explain the sophisticated cognitive componentsof human shared intentionality. Cooperative breeders such asthe callitrichids are, of course, unusual in their cooperativetendencies, but these manifest themselves in action primarilyin the form of infant carrying, shared vigilance, and foodprovisioning, where the requirement for simultaneous actualcoordination is low, and there is typically some delay betweeneach individual’s investment (for an overview, see Burkart,Hrdy, and van Schaik 2009). In searching for the evolutionaryhome of an ability to coordinate actions, form shared goalsand joint commitments, monitor and reverse designated roles,communicate relevant information and action plans, andshare resources dependently upon prior collaboration (seeTomasello et al. 2005), activities such as collaborative foragingappear to more obviously demand not just all of these, butall of them simultaneously. (Cultural institutions and lan-guage, from our second evolutionary step, make the pointeven more strongly.)In addition, the fact that high levels of cooperativeness andprosociality emerge early in human ontogeny does not meanthat they were directly selected for in infancy. Traits that areadaptive in adulthood often have ontogenetic pathways thatbegin in childhood, as long as these early forms are not mal-adaptive for children.This content downloaded from 128.243.002.141 on January 25, 2016 04:25:49 AMAll use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).690 Current Anthropology Volume 53, Number 6, December 2012The Evolutionary Emergence ofGroup-MindednessSterelny takes late Pleistocene archeological remains indicat-ing symbolic behavior and regional style as evidence for theemergence of group-mindedness. But he suggests that the keyfactors that we cite as driving this emergence (rising groupsizes and intergroup conflict) appear only much later, at thePleistocene-Holocene transition. He thus concluded that“group-mindedness comes before large groups.”There is little dispute that upper Paleolithic hominins weresymbolically modern (Bar-Yosef 2002). However, the claimthat symbolic competence emerged with a “creative explo-sion” in upper Paleolithic Eurasia (see, e.g., Chase and Dibble1987) is contested: symbolic behavior and marking may havemuch earlier roots in middle Stone Age Africa, as evidenced,for example, by burial remains and potentially symbolic useof red ochre pigment for symbolic marking (McBrearty andBrooks 2000).We in no way intend to resolve this debate. Rather, wehighlight that utilitarian arguments against, for example, thesymbolic use of ochre for group marking (e.g., that it mayhave been used to enhance visibility or to increase perceivedthreat; Sterelny 2011) may just point to an early stage in theemergence of the medium as symbolic: status functionsemerge as humans collectively come to regard some naturalor brute phenomenon (typically, actions or objects) as havinga special meaning (Searle 1995). So media that were used forsymbolic group marking are expected to enter the archeo-logical record for utilitarian functions initially. And there issome evidence that group size increases long before the Pa-leolithic may have created selection pressures related to main-taining group cohesion: since community size and complexitycorrelate with neocortex ratio in anthropoid primates (Dun-bar 1993, 2009), group sizes can be estimated for early hom-inins (Aiello and Dunbar 1993). Rather than indicating anysignificant change in size around the Holocene, these esti-mates suggest that group numbers progressed toward criticallevels over the middle Pleistocene, with the emergence ofHomo heidelbergensis between 400,000 and 150,000 years ago.At this time, it is suggested, new mechanisms for maintainingwithin-group social cohesion would have become of para-mount importance.Finally, increases in group size and intergroup conflict maynot have temporally co-occurred in driving the emergence ofgroup-mindedness. It is conceivable that with increasinggroup sizes, initially functional behaviors (such as foragingtechniques or utilitarian uses of red ochre) began to functionas useful conventional indicators of group membership, aid-ing in-group members in their choices of whom to coordinatewith and whom to trust. At a later point, increasingly routineintergroup conflicts might have partially transformed the rel-evance of these internal group signals to the status of between-group cultural markers.—Emily Wyman, Michael Tomasello, Alicia Melis,Claudio Tennie, and Esther HerrmannReferences CitedAiello, L., and R.

However, in contrast to population interactions such as competition and predation, a comprehensive and succinct theoretical explanation of mutualism has proved elusive. We use a new modelling framework that represents obligation, mutualist benefits and mutualist costs in an extended consumer resource approach to develop simple, consistent models of mutualism. We show how populations may stably transition between facultative and obligate mutualism and demonstrate that our solutions do not depend on saturating functions.

We provide a definition of friendship supported by anthropology research that we believe is plausible, widely accepted, and distinct from altruism. This motivates a game-theoretic model of friendship that provides a characterization of how friendship in a bilateral relationship can explain cooperation in a finite-horizon setting without the aid of altruism or pro-social preferences. We highlight the difference between two key equilibria of our model: opportunistic friendship that is short-lived and driven by material support, and sustained friendship that is long-lived and is distinguished from opportunistic friendship by the provision of support without the expectation of return. Opportunistic friendship seems more likely in environments characterized by economic uncertainty such as in developing countries or immigrant communities. We provide cross-cultural examples of friendship that are consistent with the conditions underpinning opportunistic versus sustained friendship equilibria",,text,"friendship, cooperation, opportunism, complementarity, game-theory",,
Enhanced Mutualism Hypothesis,484265775,Evidence of Human Adaptations for Cooperative Partner Choice in a Biological Market,,"Eisenbruch, Adar Benjamin",2017,"Despite the importance of human cooperation, how humans choose their cooperative partners and how they divide the spoils of cooperation are not yet fully understood. Mutual partner choice creates competitive conditions for cooperative relationship formation, in which individuals compete to form cooperative relationships with the most valuable available partners. Biological market theory therefore predicts that the spoils of cooperation will be divided as a function of each party’s cooperative partner value. This dissertation reports research designed to test two interrelated hypotheses: (1) humans will possess psychological mechanisms designed by natural selection to assess the value of an individual as a long-term cooperative partner, and (2) human intuitions about how the spoils of cooperation should be divided will track cues of cooperative partner value. Six studies were conducted to test these hypotheses. Two commonly-used economic games (the ultimatum game and the trust game) were used to test cooperative partner preferences and resource division intuitions (studies 1-5), and a friend choice task was used to test cooperative partner preferences (study 6). Cooperative partner traits were represented by facial photographs (studies 1, 2 and 6), or were experimentally manipulated with verbal information and in-game monetary consequences (studies 3-5). Results supported the hypotheses. Participants exhibited preferences for partners who appeared more valuable as long-term cooperative partners, and these preferences appeared to be specialized for ancestral forms of cooperation: participants were more sensitive to cues of ancestral productivity than contemporary productivity, participants were more sensitive to cues of productivity when they revealed stable skills rather than luck, and men relied relatively more on a partner’s productivity (versus their generosity) than did women. In addition, intuitions about resource divisions were sensitive to cues of partner value: partners who appeared more valuable received more favorable divisions in the ultimatum game, and more productive partners were judged as more fair in the trust game, regardless of their actual generosity. The discussion of results focuses on future directions for the application of biological market theory and the logic of cooperative partner choice to problems in social psychology",,etd,"Psychology, Behavioral sciences, bargaining, biological market, cooperation, evolutionary psychology, fairness, partner choice",,"eScholarship, University of California"

Many mechanisms and processes have since been evoked and studied, empirically and theoretically, to explain species coexistence and the observed biological diversity. Facilitative interactions clearly have the potential to enhance coexistence. Yet, even though mutual facilitation between species of the same guild is widely documented empirically, the subject has received very little theoretical attention. Here, we study one form of intraguild mutualism in the simplest possibly community module of one resource and two consumers. We incorporate mutualism as enhanced consumption in the presence of the other consumers. We find that intraguild mutualism can (a) significantly enhance coexistence of consumers, (b) induce cyclic dynamics, and (c) give rise to a bi-stability (a 'joint' Allee effect) and potentially catastrophic collapse of both consumer species. © 2012 Elsevier B.V",,outro,"Allee effect, Complex dynamics, Facilitation, Intraguild mutualism, Species coexistence",issn:1476-945X,
Enhanced Mutualism Hypothesis,188551322,Harsh environments: Multi-player cooperation with excludability and congestion,,"De Jaegher, Kris",2019,"The common-enemy hypothesis of by-product mutualism proposes that organisms are more likely to cooperate when facing the common enemy of a harsher environment. Micro-foundations of this hypothesis have so far focused on the case where cooperation consists of the production of a pure public good. In this case, the effect of a harsher environment is ambiguous: not only a common-enemy effect is possible, but also an opposite, competing effect where the harsher environment reduces the probability of cooperation. This paper shows that unambiguous effects of a harsher environment are predicted when considering the realistic case where the collective good produced is excludable (in the sense that whether or not a player benefits from the collective good depends on whether or not he is contributing) and/or congestible (in the sense that the benefits the individual player obtains from the collective good are affected by the number of contributing players). In particular, the competing effect is systematically predicted for club goods, where defectors are excluded from the benefits of the collective good. A common-enemy effect is instead systematically predicted for charity goods, where cooperators are excluded from the benefits of the collective good. These effects are maintained for congestible club goods and for congestible charity goods.

To predict the eco-evolutionary dynamics of mutualism it is critical to extend classic pair-wise analysis to include additional species. We investigated the effect of adding a third species to a pair-wise mutualism in a spatially structured environment. We tested the hypotheses that selection for costly excretions in a focal population (i) decreases when an exploiter is added (ii) increases when a third mutualist is added relative to the pair-wise scenario. We assayed the selection acting on Salmonella enterica when it exchanges methionine for carbon in an obligate mutualism with an auxotrophic Escherichia coli. A third bacterium, Methylobacterium extorquens, was then added and acted either as an exploiter of the carbon or third obligate mutualist depending on the nitrogen source. In the tripartite mutualism M. extorquens provided nitrogen to the other species. Contrary to our expectations, adding an exploiter increased selection for methionine excretion in S. enterica. Conversely, selection for cooperation was lower in the tripartite mutualism relative to the pair-wise system. Genome-scale metabolic models helped identify the mechanisms underlying these changes in selection. Our results highlight the utility of connecting metabolic mechanisms and eco-evolutionary dynamics",,"Life sciences, medicine and health care","Life sciences, medicine and health care",,
Enhanced Mutualism Hypothesis,287730484,Mutualism and biodiversity,10.1016/j.cub.2019.03.062,"Bascompte, Jordi",2019,"Mutualism is a type of interaction in which both partners benefit from each other. For example, a butterfly receives nectar, a rich source of food, from the flower of a plant and in turn moves pollen from that plant to another far away (Figure 1). In order to reflect about the widespread nature of mutualism, John N. Thompson proposed the following thought experiment: try to imagine a plant species that is viable in its natural habitat without using on top of its own nuclear genome the genomes of a mitochondrion, a chloroplast, of several mycorrhizal fungi, of several insects to pollinate it and of several species of bird to disperse its seeds. Mutualism is everywhere and it is assumed that mutualistic interactions have played a major role in the diversification of life on Earth. An often-cited example is the rich adaptive radiation of the flowering plants (angiosperms), with about 300,000 described species. Flowering plants originated around 160 million years ago and diversified fast during the Early Cretaceous, so that by around 120 million years ago they had become widespread. It is generally assumed that such a fast diversification is largely the result of the mutualistic interaction with pollinators. Thus, mutualism has been most likely shaping the diversity of species on Earth from an early stage. But the relationships between mutualism and diversity are not yet clear, mainly because mutualism has traditionally been studied within pairs or small groups of species. Also, mutualism has historically been studied in isolation from competition, so it is unclear how these two forces balance each other in ecological communities",,"Journal Article, PeerReviewed, info:eu-repo/semantics/article, info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion","Institute of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies, 570 Life sciences; biology, 590 Animals (Zoology)",,'Elsevier BV'
Enhanced Mutualism Hypothesis,155695734,Friendship-based partner switching promotes cooperation in heterogeneous   populations,10.1016/j.physa.2015.09.025,"Chen, Wei, Wu, Te, Li, Zhiwu, Wang, Long",2016,"The forming of human social ties tends to be with similar individuals. This study concentrates on the emergence of cooperation among heterogeneous populations. A simple model is proposed by considering the impact of interplay between the evolution of strategies and that of social partnerships on cooperation dynamics. Whenever two individuals acquire the rewards by playing prisoner&apos;s dilemma game with each other, the friendship (friendship is quantified as the weight of a link) between the two individuals deepens. Individuals can switch off the social ties with the partners who are unfriendly and rewire to similar new ones. Under this partner switching mechanism, population structure is divided into several groups and cooperation can prevail. It is observed that the frequent tendency of partner switching can lead to the enhancement of cooperative behavior under the enormous temptation to defect. Moreover, the influence of discounting the relationship between different individuals is also investigated. Meanwhile, the cooperation prevails when the adjustment of friendships mainly depends on the incomes of selected individuals rather than that of their partners. Finally, it is found that too similar population fail to maximize the cooperation and there exists a moderate similarity that can optimize cooperation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Beraldo, R. Sugden1 IntroductionStudies of animal behaviour have found many practices which create collective ben-efits at some apparent cost or risk to individual participants. Examples include alarmcalls, food-sharing, grooming, and participation in inter-group warfare. One of themost fundamental problems in evolutionary biology since Darwin (1859) has been toexplain how such forms of cooperation evolve by natural selection.An analogous prob-lem in economics has been to look for explanations of cooperative human practices,such as the fulfilment of market obligations, the provision of public goods throughvoluntary contributions, and the management of common property resources, that areconsistent with the traditional assumption of individual self-interest.1 Many differ-ent theories have been proposed by biologists and economists as possible solutions.Among the mechanisms that have been modelled are direct and indirect reciprocity,kin selection, group selection, and the ‘green beard’ mechanism. (For an overview ofthese mechanisms, see Nowak (2006). Tomasello (2014) provides a comprehensiveaccount of why and how cooperation may have evolved among early humans. Hishypothesis is that early humans were forced by ecological circumstances into morecooperative modes of life, and this led to the evolution of ways of thinking that weredirected towards coordination with others to achieve joint goals.) Some economistshave combined biological and economic modes of explanation, hypothesising thathuman cooperation in the modern world is a product of genetically hard-wired traitsthat evolved by natural selection to equip Homo sapiens for life in hunter-gatherersocieties. In some versions of this hypothesis, those traits act as equilibrium selectiondevices in the modern ‘game of life’ (e.g. Binmore 1994, 1998); in others, they cangenerate non-selfish behaviour in modern societies (e.g. Boyd et al. 2005; Bowles andGintis 2011).However, a recent trend in biology has been to question whether such sophisticatedexplanations are always necessary. Many forms of apparently cooperative behaviourhave been found to be forms of mutualism: the ‘cooperating’ individual derives suf-ficient direct fitness benefit to make the behaviour worthwhile, and any effect on thefitness of others is incidental (e.g. Clutton-Brock 2002, 2009; Sachs et al. 2004). TheSnowdrift game (Sugden 1986), in which equilibrium involves cooperation by oneplayer and free-riding by the other, is increasingly used in biology as a model of suchbehaviour. In this paper, we present a newmodel of the evolution of cooperation whichfits with this trend of thought.Ourmethodological approach treats the biological and economic problems of coop-eration as isomorphic to one another. That is, we hypothesise that the emergence andreproduction of human cooperative practices are governed by evolutionary mecha-nisms that are distinct from, but structurally similar to, those of natural selection.Candidate mechanisms include trial-and-error learning by individuals, imitation of1 In parallel with attempts to explain human cooperation in terms of self-interest, there is a large literaturein economics in which cooperation is explained as a product of non-selfish motivations, such as altruism,preferences for equality, fairness or welfare-maximisation, team reasoning, or intrinsic desires to cooperate.Without denying the existence of such motivations, we think it is useful to investigate the explanatory powerof the self-interest assumption.123The emergence of reciprocally beneficial cooperationsuccessful neighbours, and cultural selection through inter-group competition. Analy-ses which use this approach may be both informed by and informative to theoreticalbiology. For example, Sugden’s (1986) analysis of the emergence of social norms wasinspired by the earlier work of theoretical biologists, but it developed new models (inparticular, the Snowdrift andMutual Aid games) which have since been widely used inbiology (e.g. Leimar and Hammerstein 2001; Nowak and Sigmund 2005). The modelthat we present in this paper can be interpreted as a representation either of naturalselection or of trial-and-error human learning.Our modelling strategy is distinctive in that it uses three assumptions which incombination rule out most of the mechanisms that feature in existing theories of coop-eration. Specifically, we assume that interactions are anonymous, that evolution takesplace in a large, well-mixed population, and that the evolutionary process selectsstrategies according to their material payoffs. The assumption of anonymity excludesmechanisms based on reputation, reciprocity or third-party punishment. The assump-tion ofwellmixedness excludesmechanisms of group or kin selection. The assumptionthat selection is for material payoffs excludes mechanisms which postulate non-selfishpreferences as an explanatory primitive. Working within the constraints imposed bythese assumptions, we are able to generate a simple and robust model of cooperation.Our model adapts the familiar framework of a Prisoner’s Dilemma that is playedrecurrently in a large population. We introduce two additional features, which wesuggest can be found in many real-world cases of potentially cooperative interaction,both for humans and for other animals.The first additional feature is that participation in the game is voluntary. One of therestrictive properties of the Prisoner’s Dilemma is that, in any given interaction, anindividual must act either pro-socially (the strategy of cooperation) or anti-socially(the strategy of defection or cheating, which allows a cheater to benefit at the expenseof a cooperator). There is no opportunity to be simply asocial. We add an asocialstrategy, that of opting out of the interaction altogether. Of course, if the only differencebetween anti-social and asocial behaviour was that asocial individuals did not benefitwhen their co-players chose to cooperate, asociality would be a dominated strategy. Itis an essential part of our model that if both players cheat, both are worse off than ifthey had opted out of the interaction.2The second additional feature is that the payoff that each player receives if theyboth cooperate is subject to random variation. Before choosing his (or her, or its)strategy, each player knows his own cooperative payoff, but not the other player’s.With non-zero probability, the payoff from mutual cooperation is greater than thatfrom cheating against a cooperator. Thus, there are circumstances in which it wouldbe profitable for a player to cooperate if he were sufficiently confident that the otherplayer would cooperate too. Crucially, however, it is never common knowledge that thepayoffs are such that mutual cooperation is a Nash equilibrium. In our model, playersreceive no information at all about the realisation of the random component of their2 In some simplified models of the Prisoner’s Dilemma, each player makes an independent decision aboutwhether to incur a fixed cost to confer a larger fixed benefit on the other player; payoffs in the four possibleoutcomes are defined as sums of these costs and benefits. Because we want to distinguish between cheatingand non-participation, our model does not have this additivity property.123S. Beraldo, R. Sugdenco-players’ cooperative payoff. This is obviously an extreme assumption; we use itonly as a modelling simplification. In real interactions, players often have some suchinformation. [For example, explanations of animal behaviour in asymmetric contestsoften depend on the assumption that both contestants recognise some feature of thegame which signals which of them is more likely to attach the higher value to thedisputed resource (Maynard Smith and Parker 1976).] But the main qualitative resultsof our model require only that each player has some private information about his ownpayoffs such that, with non-zero probability, a player may know that cooperation isa non-dominated strategy for him without knowing whether the same is true for theother player.3As an illustration of the kind of interaction that our model represents, we offerthe following variant of Rousseau’s (1755/1998, p. 36) story of hunting in a state ofnature. Two individuals jointly have the opportunity to invest time and energy to hunta deer. The hunters can succeed only by acting on a concerted plan out of sight of oneanother. A hunt begins only if both individuals agree to take part. Each can then cheatby unilaterally pursuing a smaller prey, which the other’s deer hunting tends to flushout and make easier to catch. The anticipated benefit of deer hunting to an individual,conditional on the other’s not cheating, can be different for different individuals andon different occasions. Sometimes, but not always, this benefit is sufficiently low thatunilateral cheating pays off.As a more modern illustration, consider two individuals who make contact throughthe internet. One of them is offering to sell some good which has to be customised tomeet the specific requirements of the buyer; the other is looking to buy such a good.If they agree to trade, each individual invests resources in the transaction (exchanginginformation, producing and dispatching the good, sending payment). Each may haveopportunities to gain by deviating from the terms of the agreement. Sometimes, butnot always, the benefit of completing the transaction is sufficiently low that unilateralcheating pays off.We will show how the interaction of voluntary participation and stochastic payoffscan induce cooperation. Of course, it is well known that voluntary participation canfacilitate cooperation when players can distinguish between more and less cooper-ative opponents. If such distinctions are possible, voluntary participation can allowcooperators to avoid interacting with cheats. This can sustain cooperation without theneed for informationally and cognitively more demanding strategies of reciprocity orpunishment—an idea that can be traced back to Smith’s (1763/1978, pp. 538–539)analysis of trustworthiness among traders in commercial societies. But such mecha-nisms are ruled out by our anonymity assumption.In our model, voluntary participation facilitates cooperation by a different route.Because would-be cheats have the alternative option of non-participation, and becausenon-participation is the best response to cheating, the equilibrium frequency ofcheating is subject to an upper limit. If cheating occurs at all, the expected pay-off from cheating cannot be less than that from non-participation. Thus, for any3 The gamewould be very different (and rather trivial) if all payoffs were common knowledge. In that case,there would be a Nash equilibrium in which there was no cheating and in which each player cooperated ifand only if both players gained more from mutual cooperation than from cheating against a cooperator.123The emergence of reciprocally beneficial cooperationgiven frequency of cooperation, the frequency of cheating is self-limiting. Theunderlying mechanism is similar to that of the Lotka–Volterra model of interactionbetween predators and prey: the size of the predator population (the frequency ofcheating) is limited by the size of the prey population (the frequency of coopera-tion).Clearly, however, this mechanism can support cooperation only if, when the fre-quency of cheating is sufficiently low, some players choose to cooperate. This couldnot be the case if, as in the Prisoner’s Dilemma, cooperation was always a weaklydominated strategy. In our model, random variation in the payoff from mutual coop-eration ensures that players sometimes find it worthwhile to cooperate, despite therisk of meeting a cheat. The players who cooperate are those for whom the benefitof mutual cooperation is sufficient to compensate for this risk. Because cooperatorsare self-selecting in this way, the average payoff in the game is greater than the pay-off to non-participation. In other words, despite the presence of cheats, beneficialcooperation occurs.As a first step in developing an evolutionary model, we begin (in Sect. 2) bypresenting our variant of the Prisoner’s Dilemma as a one-shot game and identi-fying its symmetric Bayesian Nash equilibria. We show that, provided the upperbound of the distribution of cooperative benefit is not too low, the game has atleast one such equilibrium in which beneficial cooperation occurs. In Sect. 3, weinvestigate some comparative-static properties of equilibria in this game. We showthat as the distribution of cooperative benefit becomes more favourable, the max-imum frequency of cooperation that is sustainable in equilibrium increases. InSect. 4, we examine the dynamics of the model, using simple analytical meth-ods. In Sect. 5, we supplement this analysis by computer simulations based onreplicator dynamics. Our analysis shows that, in the neighbourhood of ‘interior’equilibria in which some but not all players choose non-participation, the dynam-ics are similar to those of predator–prey models. Depending on the payoffs of thegame, interior equilibria may be locally stable (with evolutionary paths spirallingin from a large zone of attraction) or unstable (with evolutionary paths spirallingout and ending at an equilibrium of non-participation). In Sect. 6, we discuss thecontribution that our model can make to the explanation of cooperative behav-iour. We show that, despite sharing some features of existing biological models ofmutualism and voluntary participation, our model isolates a distinct causal mecha-nism.2 The model: equilibrium propertiesIn this section and in Sect. 3, we present our game in one-shot form and analyseits equilibrium properties. This is a game for two players 1 and 2. For each playeri ∈ {1, 2} , the benefit xi that he gains if both players cooperate is an independentrealisation of a random variable X whose distribution f (.) is continuous with support[xmin, xmax]. Each player knows his own benefit but not that of the other player. Giventhis knowledge, he plays a game with three pure strategies: to cooperate (C), to cheat(D), or not to participate (N). The payoff matrix is shown in Table 1.123S. Beraldo, R. SugdenTable 1 Payoff matrix for thegamePlayer 1 Player 2N C DN 0, 0 0, 0 0, 0C 0, 0 x1, x2 –b, aD 0, 0 a, –b –c, –cxmax > a > xmin ≥ 0; b > c > 0.The essential features of the game are contained in the structure of best responses.4The condition xmax > a > xmin implies that either C or D (but not N) may be thebetter response toC, depending on the relevant player’s realisation of X . The conditionb > c implies that, as in the Prisoner’s Dilemma, D is better than C as a response toD. Given that the payoff to N is normalised to zero, a > 0 implies that cheating givesa higher payoff than non-participation if the opponent cooperates; c > 0 implies thatthe opposite is the case if the opponent cheats. No assumption is made about whethera − b (i.e. the net benefit of an interaction in which one player cooperates and theother cheats) is positive, zero or negative. It is easy to imagine real-world applications(such as our example of internet trading) in which any of these possibilities would beplausible.5 The condition xmin ≥ 0 (which is not essential for our main results) impliesthat players are never worse off from mutual cooperation than from non-participation.We now consider symmetric Bayesian Nash equilibria (SBNE) of the game.Although our formal analysis in this section and in Sect. 3 treats the game as one-shot,our ultimate concern is with SBNEs as possible stationary points in an evolutionaryprocess in a well-mixed population.We will say that a pure strategy (N, C or D) is played in a given equilibrium ifand only if the unconditional probability with which it is played is non-zero. Somesignificant properties of SBNE hold for all parameter values. First, there is a non-participation equilibrium in which only N is played; in this equilibrium, players’payoffs are zero and unilateral deviations lead to neither gain nor loss. Second, thereis no SBNE in which C is played butD is not. (Against an opponent who might play Cbut will not playD, i’s best response playsDwhen xi < a.) Third, there is no SBNE inwhichD is played but not C. (Against an opponent who might playD but will not playC, N is the unique best response.) Thus, only two types of equilibrium participationare possible. Depending on the parameter values, there may be an interior equilibriumin whichN,D andC are all played; and there may be a boundary equilibrium in whichD and C are played but not N.4 Provided that this best response structure is maintained, themain implications of themodel are preserved.It is not essential that the payoff from playing C against C is stochastic and that all other payoffs are not;but there must be some random variation in the payoffs, such that the best reply to C is sometimes C andsometimes D.5 In our game, unlike the ‘additive’ Prisoner’s Dilemma games described in Footnote 2, the sign of a − bimposes no constraints on whether the payoff from playing C against C is greater or less than that fromplaying D against D.123The emergence of reciprocally beneficial cooperationSince the only information on which a player can condition his strategy choice isprivate to that player, and given the assumed properties of f (.), any SBNE can bedescribed by the values of two variables. The variable β ∈ [xmin, xmax] is definedsuch that each player i chooses C if and only if xi ≥ β. The variable π ∈ [0, 1]is the probability that each player i chooses D, conditional on xmin < xi < β. Inthe non-participation equilibrium, β = xmax and π = 0. In an interior equilibrium,xmin < β < xmax and 0 < π < 1. In a boundary equilibrium, xmin < β < xmax andπ = 1.We now analyse these equilibria. Consider any player i facing an opponent whosestrategy is described by (β, π), in an interaction in which xi = β. Let VN , VD, VCand VM be the expected payoffs to player i from playing N, D, C andM, respectively,where M is the mix of D with probability π and N with probability (1 − π). Letg(x) ≡ F(x)/[1 − F(x)], where F(.) is the cumulative of f (.). It is straightforwardto derive the following expressions:VN = 0 (1)VD = [1 − F(β)]a − F(β)πc (2)VC = [1 − F(β)]β − F(β)πb (3)VM = πVD. (4)In analysing equilibrium, it is convenient to work in a (β, π) space defined byxmin ≤ β ≤ xmax and π ≥ 0. Notice that this space includes points at which π > 1.Although such points have no interpretation within our model, Eqs. (1)–(4) abovedefine VN , VD, VC , and VM for all values of π . This allows us to define the lociof points in this (β, π) space at which the mathematical equations VN = VD andVC = VM are satisfied, and then to characterise equilibria in terms of these loci,imposing the inequality π ≤ 1 as an additional constraint. This method of analysis isuseful in simplifying the proofs of our results.First, consider the locus of points in the (β, π) space at which VN = VD . Anyinterior equilibrium must be a point on this ND locus, with 0 < π < 1; any boundaryequilibrium must be a point at which VN ≤ VD and π = 1. By (1) and (2), this locusis determined by:VD ≥ (or <)VN ⇔ a/πc ≥ (or <)g(β). (5)This is a continuous and downward-sloping curve which includes the point (xmax, 0)and is asymptotic to β = xmin. It divides the (β, π) space into three regions: the setof points on the locus, at which VN = VD; the set of points inside the locus (that is,below and to the left), at which VN < VD; and the set of points outside the locus (thatis, above and to the right), at which VN > VD .Now consider the locus of points at which VC = VM . Every equilibrium mustbe a point on this CM locus, with either π = 0 (the non-participation equilibrium),0 < π < 1 (an interior equilibrium), or π = 1 (a boundary equilibrium). Combiningequations (2)–(4), this locus is determined by:VC ≥ (or <)VM ⇔ (β − πa)/[π(b − πc)] ≥ (or <)g(β). (6)123S. Beraldo, R. SugdenThis is a continuous curve which includes the points (xmin, xmin/a) and (xmax, 0) andhas the property that π < 1 when β ≤ a. It divides the (β, π) space into three regions:the set of points on the locus, at which VC = VM ; the set of points inside the locus, atwhich VC > VM ; and the set of points outside the locus, at which VM > VC .Propositions (5) and (6) together imply the following result about the relative posi-tions of the two loci:if VD = VN and β < xmax and π > 0 then VC ≥ (or <)VM ⇔ β ≥ (or <)ab/c.(7)The loci intersect at the non-participation equilibrium (xmax, 0). If xmax ≤ ab/c, thereis no other intersection and hence no interior equilibrium.6 This case is illustrated inFig. 1a. (The loci are shown by the curves ND and CM; N is the non-participationequilibrium. Sections of these loci which pass above π = 1 are drawn in grey dots tosignify that these points have no interpretation within the model. The arrows refer tothe dynamic analysis, whichwill be presented in Sect. 4.) If instead xmax > ab/c, thereis exactly one other intersection, at β = ab/c. There are now three alternative cases.In the first case, illustrated in Fig. 1b, this intersection is at π < 1. This intersection,denoted I, is an interior equilibrium, defined by β = ab/c, π = a/g(ab/c).7 Thesevalues of β and π imply that the probability with which C is played, conditional onparticipation in the game (i.e. conditional onN not being played) is c/(a+c), ensuringthat VD = 0. (Equivalently, the frequencies with which C and D are played are inthe ratio c:a.) There may also be boundary equilibria; these occur if the CM locusintersects the line π = 1 to the left of the ND locus.In the second case, the loci intersect at π > 1. Because the CM locus is continuous,and because xmin/a < 1, there must be at least one value of β in the interval a < β <ab/c at which the CM locus intersects the line π = 1. Any such point is a boundaryequilibrium. This case is illustrated in Fig. 1c; B is a boundary equilibrium. In thethird case (not illustrated), the loci intersect exactly at π = 1. Then this intersectionis a boundary equilibrium. In this case, there may be other boundary equilibria.The foregoing argument establishes:Result 1 If xmax > ab/c, there is at least one (interior or boundary) equilibrium with0 < π ≤ 1 and xmin < β < xmax.In other words, provided the upper tail of the distribution of cooperative benefit is nottoo short, there is at least one equilibrium in which both C and D are played.We now consider players’ payoffs in such equilibria. Let V *(β, π ) be the ex anteexpected payoff to any player i , prior to the realisations of the random variable X ,given that i and his opponent play according to β and π . We will call V ∗(β, π) thevalue of the game conditional on (β, π).The following results are derived in the Mathematical Appendix:6 In this case, it is possible that the CM locus intersects the line π = 1, creating boundary equilibria.However, this would require a high proportion of the probability mass of f (X) to be between a and xmax,despite the fact that xmax ≤ ab/c.7 The equilibrium value of π can be derived from (2) using the fact that, in an interior equilibrium, VD = 0.123The emergence of reciprocally beneficial cooperationFig. 1 Equilibria and dynamics.a Non-participation the onlyequilibrium. b An interiorequilibrium. c A boundaryequilibriumabc123S. Beraldo, R. SugdenResult 2 In every interior and boundary equilibrium, the value of the game is strictlypositive.Result 3 Suppose there are two equilibria, (β, π), (β ′, π ′), such that β < β ′. ThenV ∗(β, π) > V ∗(β ′, π ′).Result 2 establishes that in every interior and boundary equilibrium, cooperativeactivity creates positive net benefits relative to the benchmark of non-participation,despite the non-zero probability of cheating. If there are multiple equilibria, one ofthese is distinguished by its having the lowest value of β. (Since there can be no morethan one interior equilibrium, no two equilibria have the same value of β.) Result 3establishes that this is the equilibrium at which the value of the game is greatest. Wewill call this the highest-value equilibrium.3 The model: comparative staticsThe frequency of cooperative behaviour that can be sustained in equilibrium dependson the distribution of cooperative benefit X . To keep the exposition simple, we analysethe effect of a rightward shift from one distribution F to an unambiguously superiordistribution G when there is no change in the support [xmin, xmax]. That is, for allxmin < z < xmax,G(z) < F(z). The values of all other parameters are held constant.Using (5) it can be shown that if some point (β, π) is on the ND locus for thedistribution F , it is inside the corresponding locus for G. Similarly, using (6), if somepoint (β, π) is on the CM locus for the distribution F , it is inside the correspondinglocus for G. Thus, an improvement in the distribution of cooperative benefit movesboth loci outwards. Figure 2 illustrates the effects of a shift in the distribution from F[inducing the loci ND(F) and CM(F)] to G [inducing the loci ND(G) and CM(G)].As this diagram shows, if the game has interior equilibria for both distributions,those equilibria have the same value of β, namely ab/c, but the G equilibrium has ahigher value of π . Since G(ab/c) < F(ab/c) and the frequencies with which C andD are played are in the fixed ratio c:a, both C and D are played with higher frequencyFig. 2 Effects of a shift in thedistribution of cooperativebenefit123The emergence of reciprocally beneficial cooperationin the G equilibrium than in the F equilibrium. More intuitively, the relationshipbetween cooperation and cheating is analogous to that between prey and predator. Ifthe distribution of cooperative benefit becomes more favourable, a higher frequencyof cooperation is induced; but the more cooperation there is, the more cheating can besustained.If the game has boundary equilibria for both distributions, the highest-value Gequilibrium must be to the left of the highest-value F equilibrium. (This can be seenby considering the effect of an outward shift of the CM locus in Fig. 1c.) Thus, theformer equilibrium induces a higher frequency of cooperation than the latter.The following general result is proved in the Appendix:Result 4 Suppose xmax > ab/c and let F , G be two distributions of X such that Gis rightward of F . Then in the highest-value G equilibrium, the frequency of cooper-ation and the value of the game are both strictly greater than in the highest-value Fequilibrium.Thus, as the distribution of cooperative benefit becomes progressively morefavourable, the maximum sustainable frequency of cooperation increases.8 Increasesin cooperation are associated with increases in cheating until the frequency of non-participation falls to zero.4 The model: dynamicsWenow embed our game in an evolutionary process.We consider a finite population ofpotential players, sufficiently large to legitimate the use of the law of large numbers.In each of a long series of periods, individuals from this population are randomlyand anonymously matched to play the game. Since we are presenting an evolutionaryanalysis, we do not define any concept of ‘lifetime’ utility that players maximise.Instead, we assume that, at the population level, behaviour gravitates towards whateverpattern of play is currently payoff-maximising for individuals, given the behaviour ofthe population as a whole.In this section, we present a simple dynamic analysis that can be represented inthe (β, π) space of Fig. 1. For the purposes of this analysis, β and π are interpretedas descriptions of the mix of strategies played in the population at any given time:β ∈ [xmin, xmax] is the critical value of X such that C is chosen by any player i if andonly if xi ≥ β, and π ∈ [0, 1] is the relative frequency of D choices among playersfor whom xi < β. We assume that β and π evolve independently. (In a biologicalapplication, this is equivalent to assuming that β and π are determined by distinctsets of genes.) Thus, the direction of change of β depends on the relative values ofVC and VM : β tends to increase (respectively: decrease) if VM > VC (VM < VC ).The direction of change of π depends on the relative values of VD and VN : π tendsto increase (decrease) if VD > VN (VD < VN ). This gives the dynamics shown inphase-diagram form in Fig. 1.8 This comparative-static property is compatible with evidence that in both human and non-human interac-tion, the level of cooperation is greater, the higher the payoffs to cooperation (Clutton-Brock 2002; Capraroet al. 2014).123S. Beraldo, R. SugdenIn the case shown in Fig. 1a, the dynamics in the neighbourhood of the non-participation equilibrium (N) are cyclical. At the level of generality at which we areworking, it is not possible to determine whether this equilibrium is locally stable, butit has a non-empty zone of attraction, including at least all points at which β = xmax.In the cases shown in Fig. 1b, c, the non-participation equilibrium is locally unstable.(In these cases, all paths from points close to N but below the ND locus lead awayfromN, and must eventually pass through or to the left of the interior equilibrium I. Asin the case shown in Fig. 1a, N has a non-empty zone of attraction.) However, in statesin which almost all players choose non-participation, selection pressure is weak, andso the dynamics shown in the diagrams might work very slowly in the region close toN.It is clear from Fig. 1b that, in the neighbourhood of an interior equilibrium, thedynamics exhibit cyclical or spiralling paths. Described in terms of the evolution ofthe frequencies of the three strategies N, C and D, these paths are similar to those ofthe Rock–Paper–Scissors game. (The frequency of cooperation is greatest towards theleft of the diagram, where the value of β is low. From there, evolutionary paths leadtowards the top right, where the values of β and π are both high, and the frequency ofcheating is greatest. From there, paths lead towards the bottom right, where β is highand π is low, and the frequency of non-participation is greatest. And from there, pathslead back towards the left. If paths spiral outwards, they may lead into the zone ofattraction of the non-participation equilibrium.) These paths resemble predator–preyinteractions, cheats acting as predators and cooperators as prey.If the CM locus cuts the line π = 1 at a point where β < ab/c, this point is aboundary equilibrium. If, as in the case shown in Fig. 1c, points to the left of thisequilibrium are outside the locus, the equilibrium is locally stable. Not all boundaryequilibria have this property, but whenever the ND and CM loci intersect at π > 1,there must be at least one locally stable boundary equilibrium.5 SimulationsIn this section, we briefly illustrate some basic features of our theoretical model bymeans of computer simulations. Using a simple deterministic replicator dynamics, weanalyse the evolution of β and π over time, and the associated relative frequenciespN , pC and pD with which strategies N, C and D respectively are played. Furtherdetails are provided in the “Mathematical Appendix”.9In applying replicator dynamics to our game, we cannot treat N-players, C-playersand D-players as distinct sub-populations which replicate separately. This is because,in ourmodel, players’ decisions about whether or not to cooperate in any given interac-tion are conditioned on the relevant realisation of the random variable X . Our methodis to assume that at any given time t , all players are characterised by the same (β, π)pair. In replicator dynamics, the growth rate of the population fraction using a given9 In a preliminary version of this paper, we presented simulations based on a stochastic evolutionaryprocess in which selection acted directly on β and π . However, as a referee suggested, themain evolutionaryproperties of our model can be conveyed more simply through replicator dynamics.123The emergence of reciprocally beneficial cooperationTable 2 Type and stabilityproperties of interior equilibriaValue of c Interior equilibrium propertiesc ≤ 1.33 No interior equilibrium1.33 < c < 1.66 Improper node, unstablec = 1.66 Proper node, unstable1.66 < c < 2.3094 Spiral node, unstablec = 2.3094 Hopf bifurcation occurs2.3094 < c < 2.4 Spiral node, asymptotically stablec ≥ 2.4 No interior equilibriumstrategy is proportional to the difference between the current payoff of that strategyand the weighted average of the current payoffs of all strategies, each strategy beingweighted by the relative frequency with which it is played (Taylor and Jonker 1978).For the purposes of our analysis, we define the current payoff to each strategy as theexpected payoff to any player i from choosing that strategy, conditional on the currentvalues of pN , pC and pD and conditional on xi being equal to the current value of β.At each time t , the rates of change of pN , pC and pD are determined by the replicatorequations; these changes are then implemented through changes in β and π . Thismethod allows mathematically tractable simulations while conserving the essentialfeatures of the dynamics described theoretically in Sect. 4.10Our simulations use the parameter values a = 3, b = 4, xmin = 0 and xmax = 9;the distribution of X over the interval [xmin, xmax] is assumed to be uniform. Weinvestigate the dynamics at different values of c, with particular emphasis on values inthe interval [1.33, 2.4] in which interior equilibria occur. (If c ≤ 1.33, xmax ≤ ab/c,and so the CM and ND loci intersect only at the non-participation equilibrium; if c ≥2.4, the loci intersect at π ≥ 1.) Intuitively, increases in c (that is, increases in the costincurred by each player when both cheat) reduce the rewards from cheating and sofavour cooperation.Irrespective of the value of c, the non-participation equilibrium is unstable underreplicator dynamics. (Since C is the best response to every non-degenerate mix ofC and N, any path starting at a point at which π = 0 and xmax > β > xmin mustmove away from the non-participation equilibrium along the line π = 0.) However,there are also paths that converge to the non-participation equilibrium. (Since N is thebest response to every non-degenerate mix of N and D, any path starting at a point atwhich β = xmin and 1 > π > 0 must have this property.) The stability properties ofinterior equilibria are less immediately obvious. It turns out that, as c varies, there arequalitative changes in the dynamics associated with interior equilibria.Table 2 reports the type and stability properties of the interior equilibriumat differentvalues of c. This equilibrium is unstable for 1.33 < c < 2.3094 but asymptoticallystable for 2.3094 < c < 2.4. At c = 2.3094 there is a Hopf bifurcation (see the“Mathematical Appendix” for details).10 The main difference between the two ways of modelling the dynamics relates to states in which at leastone of pN , pC and pD is equal to zero (i.e. where β = xmin, β = xmax, π = 0 or π = 1). In replicatordynamics, a strategy that is not played in any one period is never played, irrespective of its payoffs. Sinceour main concern in this section is with interior equilibria, this difference is not particularly significant.123S. Beraldo, R. SugdenFigure 3 shows the dynamics at different values of c. In Fig. 3a, c = 1 and theCM and ND loci intersect only at the non-participation equilibrium. Paths that startclose to the non-participation equilibrium but below the CM locus initially moveaway from that equilibrium, but then approach it from above ND locus; all pathsconverge asymptotically to the β = xmax line. As c increases (Fig. 3b, c) the generalpicture does not change until the Hopf bifurcation occurs: paths that start close to theinterior equilibrium eventually approach the non-participation equilibrium. But afterthis bifurcation, paths that start below the ND locus spiral in to the interior equilibrium(Fig. 3d). The implication is that there is a range of parameter values for which a stableinterior equilibrium exists and has a large zone of attraction.6 DiscussionWe do not intend to claim that our model represents the mechanism that underlieshuman and animal cooperation. There is no good reason to suppose that cooperationis a single phenomenon with a unified causal explanation. We find it more plausible toview cooperation as a family of loosely related phenomena which may have multiplecauses. We offer our model as a stylised representation of one mechanism by whichcooperation might emerge and persist.Our model is unusually robust in that it assumes only materially self-interestedmotivations and applies to anonymous, well-mixed populations. In claiming this asa merit of the model, we do not deny that individuals sometimes act on pro-socialmotivations. It has long been known that experimental subjects often cooperate innon-repeated and anonymous Prisoner’s Dilemmas (Sally 1995).Nor do we deny that many recurrent cooperative interactions are between individ-uals who are known to one another, or that populations of potential cooperators areoften structured into clusters of individuals who interact mainly with their neighbours.Each of these factors can contribute to the explanation of cooperation in particularenvironments. Nevertheless, theories that depend on non-anonymity, or on populationstructures taking particular forms, have restricted domains of application. And sinceself-interest is a very common and reliable motivation, models which assume onlyself-interest can be expected to be particularly robust.As an illustration of how theories with less robust assumptions can be restrictedin their application, we consider the currently much-discussed hypothesis of altruis-tic punishment (Fehr and Gächter 2000; Gintis et al. 2005). The key insight is thatmultilateral cooperation can be sustained in equilibrium if individuals have low-costoptions of punishing one another, and if even a relatively small proportion of individ-uals have relatively weak preferences for punishing non-cooperators. However, thegeneral effectiveness of this mechanism depends on the cost of punishing being lowrelative to the harm inflicted, and on the absence of opportunities for punishees toretaliate (Herrmann et al. 2008; Nikiforakis 2008); and it requires that at least someindividuals have non-selfish preferences for punishing. Such preferences might besustained by cultural group selection in hunter-gatherer economies, where groups aresmall and inter-group warfare is frequent, but these conditions are not typical of themodern world; even among hunter-gatherers, biological group selection of altruistic123The emergence of reciprocally beneficial cooperationFig.3Replicatordynamicsfordifferentvaluesofc123S. Beraldo, R. Sugdenpunishment would be frustrated by inter-group gene flow (Boyd et al. 2005). Altru-istic punishment should be understood as a mechanism that can sustain cooperationin specific types of environment, not as the solution to the problem of explainingcooperation. We claim no more than this for our own model.We have said that our model is in the same spirit as some recent work by biologists,which finds apparently cooperative behaviour to be directly beneficial to the individualcooperator (see Sect. 1 above). But, as we now explain, the explanatory principles usedby these biologists are not the same as those exhibited in our model.One of the fundamental features of our model is that the cooperative behaviour itdescribes is reciprocally beneficial. By this, we mean the following. Such cooperationis not simply a unilateral action by one individual which, intentionally or unintention-ally, confers benefits on another; it is the composition of cooperative actions by twoor more individuals, the combined effect of which is to benefit each of them. In otherwords, each cooperator benefits from his action only if this action is reciprocated byone or more other individuals. In the absence of enforceable promises, reciprocallybeneficial cooperation requires at least one individual to choose a cooperative actionwithout assurance that others will reciprocate. In our model, any player who choosesto cooperate incurs a risk of loss, which is realised if his opponent cheats. One mightthink (as we are inclined to do) that reciprocal benefit is a hallmark of genuine, asopposed to apparent, cooperation (see also Sachs et al. 2004; West et al. 2007). In bio-logical models of mutualism, cooperation is not reciprocally beneficial, in the sensewe have defined.In the Snowdrift game, which is often used to model apparently cooperative animalbehaviour, cooperation and cheating are best responses to one another. In the originalstory, two drivers are stuck in the same snowdrift. Both drivers have shovels, and soeach can choose whether or not to dig. If either driver digs a way out for his own car,the other can drive out too. Each would rather be the only one to dig than remain stuck.This defines a game with Chicken payoffs; in a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium, onedriver digs and the other free-rides (Sugden 1986). Such an equilibrium is not a caseof reciprocally beneficial behaviour.Clutton-Brock (2009) offers the Soldier’s Dilemma as a model of mutualism inbiology. In this game, a patrol of soldiers is ambushed by the enemy. Soldiers who fireback attract incoming fire and increase their chance of being killed. By firing back,however, each individual reduces the probability that the patrol will be overrun. Thegain from this may be such that from an individual’s perspective there is no dilemmaat all: firing back may give the best chance of individual survival, irrespective ofwhat the others do. A biological equivalent to this game (or perhaps to Snowdrift)can be found in the behaviour of certain birds and mammals, such as Arabian bab-blers and meerkat, which feed in predator-rich environments. Individuals of thesespecies go on sentinel duty once they have fed for long enough to be close to satiation(Clutton-Brock et al. 1999). In these games, cooperation is chosen either as a dominantstrategy or as a best response to other players’ non-cooperation; it is not reciprocallybeneficial.In the story of the Soldier’s Dilemma, it would be natural to assume that cooper-ation would be a dominant strategy only if the number of soldiers in the patrol wasrelatively small, so that each of them received a significant share of the total benefit123The emergence of reciprocally beneficial cooperationcreated by his own cooperative action. Hauert et al. (2002) present a model which canbe understood as a version of the Soldier’s Dilemma in which the size of the patrolis endogenous. This is an n-player model of voluntary contributions to a public good,but with an outside option of non-participation. A player who takes the outside optionreceives a small positive payoff σ with certainty, but forgoes any share in the benefitsof the public good. Players who participate can either cooperate (contribute to thepublic good) or cheat (not contribute). Each cooperator incurs a cost of 1 and createsa benefit of r (where 1 < r < n and r > σ + 1), which is divided equally between allparticipants. This game has no pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. (If all of one’s oppo-nents take the outside option, the best response is to cooperate; if they all cooperate,the best response is to cheat; if they all cheat, the best response is the outside option.)There is a unique symmetrical mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium in which the expectedpayoff to all three strategies is σ . More intuitively, in equilibrium the expected num-ber of participants in each game is sufficiently small that cooperation and cheatingare equally profitable. Replicator dynamics have the Rock–Paper–Scissors cyclicalpattern.There are some similarities between Hauert et al.’s model and ours: both modelsinclude a non-participation option, and both induce mixed-strategy equilibria withpredator–prey characteristics. However, Hauert et al.’s model differs from ours in twosignificant ways. First, the mechanism that induces cooperation works through vari-ation in the number of participants in the cooperative activity. For this reason, themodel cannot represent cooperative activities which require a fixed number of partic-ipants. In particular, it cannot represent activities which inherently involve just twoindividuals—as, for example, most forms of market exchange do. Second, becausethe costs and benefits of contributing to the public good are non-stochastic, theexpected payoffs to cooperation, cheating and non-participation are equal in equi-librium. Thus, although some cooperative activity takes place in equilibrium, thisactivity generates no net benefit relative to non-participation: it is not reciprocallybeneficial.We suggest that our analysis provides a stylised but essentially realistic accountof a mechanism by which reciprocally beneficial cooperation can emerge and persistin anonymous, well-mixed populations in which strategies are selected according totheir material payoffs. Using two simple components—voluntary participation andstochastic payoffs—that have not previously been put together, we have constructeda robust general-purpose model of cooperation.We are conscious that, for some theoretically-oriented economists, the mechanismwe have described may seem rather prosaic. For decades, the Prisoner’s Dilemmahas been used as the paradigm model of cooperation problems, and the problem ofexplaining cooperation in that game has been treated as a supreme theoretical chal-lenge. Viewed in that perspective, a modelling strategy which relaxes the assumptionthat cooperation is always a dominated strategy may seem too easy. But we sharethe view of Worden and Levin (2007) that many real-world cooperation problemsare less intractable than the Prisoner’s Dilemma. Neglecting these cases results in anincomplete body of theory and fosters unwarranted pessimism about the possibilityof spontaneous cooperation.123S. Beraldo, R. SugdenMathematical appendixProof of Result 2 Let (β, π) be any interior or boundary equilibrium, and consider anyplayer i . With probability F(β), xi < β and i plays N orD. In an interior equilibrium,VD = VN = 0. In a boundary equilibrium, VD ≥ VN = 0 and N is not played. Ineither case, i’s expected payoff is equal to VD and is non-negative. With probability1 –F(β), xi ≥ β and i plays C. If xi = β, i is indifferent between C and D and theexpected payoff is again VD . If xi > β, i plays C; his expected payoff (conditionalon xi > β) exceeds that in the xi = β case by [1 – F(β)](xi –β); here 1 – F(β)represents the probability that i’s opponent plays C. Hence:V ∗(β, π) = VD + [1 − F(β)] E [max(xi − β, 0)] , (8)where E is the expectation operator. Since VD ≥ 0 and β < xmax, the value ofV ∗(β, π) is strictly positive.Proof of Result 3 If (β, π) and (β ′, π ′) are both interior and/or boundary equilibria,Result 3 can be derived from (8) using the fact thatVD is decreasing inβ [an implicationof (2)]. If (β, π) is the non-participation equilibrium, V ∗(β, π) = 0 and so Result 3follows trivially from Result 2.Proof of Result 4 Suppose xmax > ab/c. Let (β, π) be the highest-value F equilib-rium and let (β ′, π ′) be the highest-value Gequilibrium. There are three possibilities.Case 1: (β, π) and (β ′, π ′) are both interior equilibria. Then β ′ = β = ab/c andπ ′ > π . (This case is illustrated in Fig. 2.) Since G(β ′) < F(β), the frequency ofcooperation is higher in the G equilibrium. Using (8) and the fact that VD = 0 inevery interior equilibrium, it can be shown that the value of the game is strictly greaterin the G equilibrium. Case 2: (β, π) and (β ′, π ′) are both boundary equilibria. Then(because the CM locus forG lies outside the CM locus for F) β ′ < β and π ′ = π = 1.Since G(β ′) < F(β), the frequency of cooperation is higher in the G equilibrium.Using (2), it can be shown that VD is strictly greater in the G equilibrium. Then,using (8) in relation to the distributions F and G, it can be shown that the value ofthe game is strictly greater in the G equilibrium. Case 3: (β, π) is an interior equi-librium and (β ′, π ′) is a boundary equilibrium. Then β ′ ≤ β and 1 = π ′ > π . SinceG(β ′) < F(β), the frequency of cooperation is higher in the G equilibrium. In theinterior equilibrium, VD = 0. In the boundary equilibrium, VD ≥ 0. Then, using (8),it can be shown that the value of the game is strictly greater in the G equilibrium.Mathematical details of replicator-dynamic analysisAs explained in Sect. 5, our simulations assume that, at any given time t , all play-ers are characterised by the same (β, π) pair. Under this assumption, and given ourassumptions about the distribution of X , the frequency of cooperation and cheating inthe population can be expressed aspC (t) = 1 − F(β(t)) = xmax − β(t)xmax(9)123The emergence of reciprocally beneficial cooperationandpD(t) = (1 − pC (t))π(t) =(β(t)xmax)· π(t) (10)respectively. LetA =⎡⎣0 0 00 β(t) −b0 a −c⎤⎦be the payoff matrix of the game and let p(t) = [pN (t), pC (t), pD(t)]′ indicate thefrequencies of the three strategies at t . As explained in Sect. 5, the payoff to eachstrategy at t is defined as the expected payoff from that strategy for a player i forwhom xi = β(t). Given this definition, the payoff vector and the average payoff aregiven by(A · p)′ = [0, β(t)pC (t) − bpD(t), apC (t) − cpD(t)]andp′Ap = pC (β(t)pC (t) − bpD(t)) + pD(apC (t) − cpD(t))respectively.

Because game theoretic analyses typically conclude that a psychology designed for direct reciprocity should defect in such situations, many have concluded that alternative explanations for human generosity—explanations beyond direct reciprocity—are necessary. However, human cooperation evolved within a material and informational ecology: Simply adding consideration of one minimal ecological relationship to the analysis of reciprocity brings theory and observation closer together, indicating that ecology-free analyses of cooperation can be fragile. Using simulations, we show that the autocorrelation of an individual’s location over time means that even a chance encounter with an individual predicts an increased probability of a future encounter with that same individual. We discuss how a psychology designed for such an ecology may be expected to often cooperate even in apparently one-shot situations. Cue-Value of Encounter 3  Cooperation in humans is ubiquitous, richly variable in form, and complex in organization. We cooperate in an enormous range of endeavors with both kin and non-kin, exchange a wide range of goods and activities, and even cooperate in large, flexible groups of overlapping membership. These facts have led to an intense debate over whether human cooperation emerges from the same selective dynamics that are widely believed to have produced cooperation in most other species1-3 (e.g., kin selection, reciprocation), or whether qualitatively different selective dynamics are needed to explain human sociality4-6. Much of the motivation for abandoning traditional explanations has centered on the empirical results of experimental economic games, played both among undergraduates in developed nations and among members of small-scale populations7-13. By design, these games are often anonymous and one-shot: Players never learn who their co-players are and play the game just once. Although there would appear to be no way to benefit from cooperative strategies in such one-shot games, many players nonetheless choose to be generous—e.g., by cooperating in a one-shot prisoners’ dilemma or allocating money to a co-player when the player could have kept it all4,6,14-16. These findings have, in part, led many researchers to conclude that higher-order forms of selection are necessary to explain human cooperation, such as cultural or genetic group selection or gene–culture coevolution5,17-23. These researchers typically make the critical assumption that the design of these experiments rule out traditional explanations for cooperation: Proponents of this view maintain that theories invoking reciprocity2,24-27 cannot explain such results because the interactions are stipulated to never repeat; that theories invoking reputation28 cannot explain the results because anonymity precludes anyone learning of a player’s behavior; and that theories invoking kin selection3,29 cannot explain the results, because interactants are not Cue-Value of Encounter 4  genetic kin. With these explanations apparently ruled out, it seems logical to conclude that some other evolutionary dynamic must be at work.  However, this line of argument suffers from a serious flaw: direct reciprocity and kin selection are general models of selection pressures, not theories of the phenotypic designs that these selection pressures construct independent of circumstances. The ways that selection pressures impact the design of organisms’ minds and bodies necessarily depends on the material and informational structure of the environments in which a particular species evolved and is therefore designed to operate within. To generate a model of an organism’s phenotypic design, general theories of selection must be combined with data on the idiosyncratic material and informational structure of a species’ environment.  For example, for kin selection models to work3, organisms must cause assistance to be delivered to genetic relatives, suggesting that evolved systems of kin detection should accompany systems of kin assistance. Indeed, many species, such as humans, have cognitive mechanisms for identifying probable genetic relatives for use in regulating cooperative and mating behavior30-32. However, while kin selection applies broadly, kin detection mechanisms are selected only when material and informational ecologies have a particular form. Other ecologies, and hence other psychologies, are possible. Consider a hypothetical species of wasp where females lay their eggs inside figs. Females mate only once and only lay eggs in figs untouched by other females. In this case, a newborn wasp will meet only full siblings; it does not need any psychological mechanisms that allow it to distinguish kin from non-kin within the fig. This hypothetical wasp’s perinatal environment has a structure that does not require kin detection mechanisms—even if kin selection were an active selective dynamic33. Selection will set a Cue-Value of Encounter 5  default level of altruism inside the fig, without the wasp needing to possess kin detection mechanisms. It is similarly necessary to consider the ancestral material and informational ecology to predict how selective dynamics would have shaped the human cooperative architecture. Given the social and natural ecology that humans actually evolved in, would theories like direct reciprocity suffice to create a psychology that cooperates to some extent in games that seem one-shot, or would higher-order selection in fact be necessary? As has been discussed by other authors10, multiple features of the ecology faced by ancestral humans suggest that selection for direct reciprocity might create psychologies willing to cooperate even in (likely rare) anonymous and one-shot conditions. One important feature is that social interactions in the real world (both ancestral and present day) involve a high degree of uncertainty. First, there is uncertainty over relative valuation, as valuations in both present and ancestral real world environments are often implicit and heterogeneous across individuals. For example, one party may misestimate the value another party places upon a resource with drastic strategic consequences: If I underestimate the value of a resource to you, I may take it and unintentionally incur your wrath34. Although the stakes in experimental games are often explicit with clear monetary values attached, the relative value between individuals can still be ambiguous; a player in need may place a greater internal valuation on a given stake than others do. Second, there is uncertainty over the spread of reputation. In experimental games, experimenters often go to great lengths to (i) ensure that subjects’ behavior will be kept confidential, and (ii) communicate this fact to subjects35. In contrast, in the real world, both now and ancestrally, situations hardly, if ever, contain such certainty—there is always a chance of being observed by agents whose presence is undetected. Indeed, even highly controlled Cue-Value of Encounter 6  experimental games may have residual uncertainty: Although assurances from an experimenter might be strong predictors of anonymity, other cues, such as knowledge that other players are community members, point in the opposite direction36. Third, there is uncertainty over a relationship’s time horizon. In experimental games, situations are often structured so as to occur only once before the experiment is concluded, and in concert with the anonymity this fact should preclude any future consequences from game behavior. In contrast, in the real world the future of nearly every interaction is uncertain and, because of this, analytic and simulation results show that selection favors decision rules that are generous even in apparently one-shot encounters1. Although many features of ancestral human ecology, in concert with selection pressures for direct reciprocity, might create psychologies willing to cooperate in anonymous and one-shot conditions, here we focus on a single, simple feature: encountering someone now probabilistically predicts encountering that person again. Indeed, the only event that uniquely precludes the possibility of future interactions is the death of one of the interactants. Aside from this case, the probability of future encounter may be decidedly greater than zero. Why might encounter probabilistically predict reencounter? The world is a complex causal system, and whatever causal forces went into encountering a particular individual, to the extent that these forces persist over time, they are more likely than chance to cause re-encounter37. For example, the world is large relative to an individual’s ability to navigate within it, especially under ancestral conditions without modern transportation technology. Thus, an individual’s location will be autocorrelated over time. That two individuals are in the same place at the same time—conditions necessary for encounter—suggests that they have a higher than baseline chance of a future encounter based merely on the autocorrelation of location. Cue-Value of Encounter 7  A large literature explores the effects of spatiality (or viscosity) on the evolutionary dynamics of cooperative strategies. Viscosity, for example, in the dispersal of offspring can lead to designs for cooperation gaining a larger share of the benefits of cooperation than in other environments (but at the same time can lead to greater competition among kin for access to local resources)38-40. As in the wasp example, viscosity may also relax selection on kin detection leading to less discriminant cooperation, but can also expose patches of cooperators to roving exploiters41. Yet, one facet of a spatially viscous ecology that has gone relatively unexplored is the impact of spatial viscosity on re-encounter rates. In other words, while viscosity limits the dispersal of genes in a spatial environment, raising genetic assortment, it also limits the dispersal of agents in a social environment, potentially raising re-encounter rates.  When environments are structured such that encounter predicts re-encounter, natural selection might favor phenotypic designs that act as if conspecifics encountered now will be re-encountered. To the extent that the human mind is designed to act as if it expected repeated interactions, humans will be more cooperative in apparently one-shot or short-term interactions than a retrospective or omniscient analysis would predict. Game theoretic analyses show that if an interaction is one-shot or has a clear, finite endpoint then the payoff-maximizing behavior is to defect. But real minds necessarily have access to only limited and imperfect information—it is impossible to know for certain whether an interaction will be one-shot or will repeat indefinitely into the future. Thus, although some cues in a current interaction might suggest it is one-shot (e.g., the interactants are strangers), if encountering someone now predicts encountering them again, selection might create cooperative psychologies that expect this correlation. Such an expectation will lead to greater default levels of cooperation. Moreover, the strength of this Cue-Value of Encounter 8  expectation—and thus default levels of cooperation—should increase in proportion to the strength of the correlation between encountering someone now and encountering them again. It is critical to note that such expectations are not necessarily conscious or articulable; instead, they might be implicit in the design of the mechanisms that generate cooperative decisions. This is analogous to human color constancy mechanisms: The visual system expects a certain spectrum of wavelengths as produced by long-enduring celestial and terrestrial light sources. This expectation is, of course, not conscious or articulable. Moreover, it can be fooled by anomalous, modern experiences, such as artificial lighting in a nighttime parking lot giving rise to the illusion that a yellow car is blue42. Analytic and simulation studies of the evolution of reciprocity show that selection can build extremely strong implicit expectations of repeat encounters. Such expectations can cause high levels of cooperation even in situations where agents have explicit, articulable beliefs that an interaction is one-shot1. In other words, people might have reportable beliefs that an interaction is one-shot but, because of the expectations embodied in their evolved cooperative psychology, they cooperate nonetheless. Our goal here is to use simulations to explore how the spatial structure of ancestral ecologies affects whether people will re-encounter each other. While human life is intricately complex, in these simulations we include only the most basic of assumptions—that the world has spatial extent, that agents can move within it, that agents encounter each other when they are nearby—so that our results are as generalizable as possible. It is impossible to believe the world of our ancestors lacked these minimal features. We conducted a series of 8,250 simulations to determine whether—under these minimal assumptions—encountering someone now predicts encountering them in the future. We also test the degree to which this relationship is dependent upon quantitative features of the social ecology. (Simulations were written in Java by author Cue-Value of Encounter 9  M.M.K, and checked for errors by author A.W.D. Source code is available upon request to author M.M.K.) In these simulations a population of agents was allowed to randomly navigate a simulated world; throughout, the simulation recorded which other agents they encountered along the way.   Results Simulation Details To parameterize our simulated environment, we consulted the average living conditions of traditionally living populations reported by Marlowe43. Marlowe reports the averages of two samples: the average population density across all surveyed groups was .25 persons/km2 with an average local group area of approximately 1600 km2; for the subset warm climate non-equestrian sample—thought by Marlowe to better represent ancestral conditions—the average population density was .31 persons/km2 with an average local group area of approximately 500 km2. To approximate this range of conditions, we simulated populations of 125, 250 and 500 agents. Assuming the 1600 km2 living area of the full sample, this yields a population density ranging from .08-.31 persons/km2, enclosing the mean of the full sample (.25); assuming the 500 km2 living area of the ancestrally representative sample, this yields a population density ranging from .25-1.0 persons/km2, enclosing the mean of the ancestrally representative sample (.31). As illustrated by Table 1, population size contributed to approximately 0.00% of the variance in re-encounter rate, suggesting that differences in population density within even a range this large are relatively unimportant.  In each simulation run n ∈	ሼ125,	250,	500ሽ agents were each randomly assigned a location within a two-dimensional space with sides 1 arbitrary unit long. How this space maps Cue-Value of Encounter 10  onto real area depends on assumptions that cannot be known with certainty. As described in the previous paragraph, this space could be viewed as 1600 km2 or 500 km2; either way the population densities within this space represent reasonable values for small-scale societies. To test for the existence of edge-effects, this space was sampled twice: once with hard edges which constrained agents’ movements (agents’ movements perpendicular to an encountered edge were truncated at the edge), and once without edges such that space wrapped seamlessly from top-to-bottom and left-to-right. On each of 500 time steps these agents moved by drawing a random distance from a normal distribution with mean of 0 and a standard deviation d	∈	ሼ.01,	.02,	.03,	.04,	.05ሽ, and a random angle ϴ~Uሺ0,	360ሻ. If the distance drawn was negative, the agent moved in the direction opposite to the drawn angle. Assuming the population density of Marlowe’s43 full sample, these walking distance parameter values represent an average movement between 0.17 km (for n = 125 & d = .01) and 1.78 km (for n = 500 & d = .05) every time step (and movements larger than 0.44 km and 4.47 km, respectively, 4.6% of the time). These movements could be thought of as frequent, periodic foraging trips, or other less frequent transitions; as illustrated by Fig 1, the rates of encounter and re-encounter are extremely stable over all but the final time steps in a simulation run. This suggests that our choice of 500 time steps had little impact on the qualitative effects in our simulation. Indeed, a greater number of time steps would have only strengthened our effect, increasing the likelihood that a person encountered now will be encountered later. Moreover, a much smaller number of time steps would be unrealistic: On almost any interpretation of what a time step represents, several hundred over the course of a forager’s lifespan would be likely. Finally, the number of time steps per run was chosen to give an adequate sampling without introducing the computational burden Cue-Value of Encounter 11  of simulating longer, yet informationally redundant runs, allowing easier direct replicability by other researchers.  At each time step, for each agent, the program evaluated if another agent was within a defined meeting radius r	∈	ሼ.005,	.01,	.015,	.02,	.025ሽ; if so, the program recorded that the two agents met during this time step. Assuming the average ecology of Marlowe’s43 sample, these meeting radius parameter values represent a range between 0.11 km (for n = 125 & r = .005) and 1.12 km (for n = 500 & r = .025) wherein agents would be considered encountered.  After a run was completed, we computed for each time step: (1) The average re-encounter rate: For each agent, we computed the proportion of other agents encountered during that time step who were re-encountered in the future; these values were then averaged across agents. (2) The average encounter base rate: For each agent, we computed the proportion of all other agents (regardless of whether they met this time step) who were encountered in any future time step; these values were then averaged across agents. The re-encounter rate is a conditional probability: Given that two agents are meeting in this time step, it is the probability they will meet in a future time step. The encounter base rate quantifies, irrespective of any additional information during this time step, the probability that two agents will meet in a future time step. The difference of these two values gives the “autocorrelation effect”: the marginal increase in the probability of future encounter given present encounter in a spatial world. Randomness—independent of any effects of spatiality—can cause agents to encounter each other in the future. Computing the autocorrelation effect allows us to quantify how spatiality affects re-encounter rates. The strength of the autocorrelation effect depends on the extent to which spatiality affects agents’ social interactions; this is manipulated across simulations by the walking distance and Cue-Value of Encounter 12  meeting radius parameters. Increasing walking distance should lead to a smaller autocorrelation effect. To see this, consider what happens if the walking distance approaches infinity. If so, then the probability of two agents meeting now is unaffected by where they were located previously; this would imply that a person is just as likely to encounter someone living kilometers away as they are to encounter their next-door neighbor. Although there will be re-encounters in this case—you might randomly meet your neighbor or the distant person again—spatiality per se would have no effect on the rates of re-encounter.  Decreasing meeting radius should also lead to a smaller autocorrelation effect. Consider what happens as the meeting radius approaches zero: It will be almost impossible to ever meet anyone, pushing re-encounter rates and base rates of encounter to zero; when both rates take the same value (viz., zero), there is no autocorrelation effect. At the limit of infinitely small meeting radius people would not meet or interact with others standing next to them. (We only studied values for meeting radius that were relatively small compared to the total size of the population’s range. If the meeting radius was large, encompassing most of the range, we would also expect no autocorrelation effect. In this case, however, both re-encounter rate and encounter based rates would be very high. This would occur because all agents would constantly be encountering every other agent. Thus, over a very broad range the relationship between meeting radius and the autocorrelation effect would be an inverse U-shape.) Fifty runs were completed at each combination of n, d, r	and edges state yielding 7500 runs. These aggregated re-encounter rates and their margins over baseline (the autocorrelation effect) were analyzed in a general linear model (GLM) framework to produce estimates of effect size (Tabs. 1 and 2). An additional 50 runs were completed at each combination of n & r such that each agent’s location was completely random in the current time step relative to its location Cue-Value of Encounter 13  in the previous time step (totaling 750 additional simulation runs). This models the null case of a world without autocorrelation of location over time and was accomplished by setting d = 1 (effectively, d approached infinity in these runs).   Findings Our analysis makes two related claims. First, given even the most minimal assumptions, encountering someone now should predict encountering them again. This is measured by re-encounter rate. Selection can use the quantitative level of this rate to set default levels of cooperation. Second, the re-encounter rate should be partially a function of how spatiality affects social encounters. This is measured as the autocorrelation effect (the re-encounter rate minus the base rate of encounter). Were individuals encountered in the present likely to be encountered again in the future? Yes, re-encounter rates were sizeable: As depicted in Fig. 1, across the range of both walking distance (Fig. 1a) and meeting radius (Fig. 1b) agents encountered on a given time step were often re-encountered. For instance, at the median walking distance (d = .03), encountering someone now meant there was approximately a 50% chance of meeting them again within the arbitrary time frame. Similarly, at the median meeting radius (r = .015), encountering someone now meant there was approximately a 60% chance of meeting them again. As such, and given an ecology where cooperation yielded gains in trade, an agent could profit from a design expressing the default expectation that those she encountered may be encountered again and were potentially profitable cooperation partners. Holding parameters constant, re-encounter rate was highly stable across much of an agent’s life, only falling off around the final few time steps. Considering the GLM estimates for re-encounter rate, shorter distances walked lead to higher re-Cue-Value of Encounter 14  encounter rates, and walking distance accounted for 8.3% of all variance in re-encounter rates (Table 1). Larger meeting radii lead to higher re-encounter rates, and meeting radius accounted for 13.9% of all variance in re-encounter rates. Although raw re-encounter rates are the ecological value that should be used by selection in designing cooperative psychology, our analysis predicts that re-encounter rates will be affected by how spatiality affects sociality. Was the spatiality of social interactions important in setting raw re-encounter rates? Yes, this can be seen in autocorrelation effects. As depicted in Figs. 1c,d and Fig. 2, the marginal increase in future encounter was substantial. For instance, at the median walking distance (d = .03), the autocorrelation effect increased the probability of future encounter given present encounter by a margin of over 30%. Similarly, at the median meeting radius (r = .015), the autocorrelation effect increased the probability of future encounter given present encounter by a margin of over 40%.  To illustrate the effect of spatiality and autocorrelation on determining re-encounter rates, Fig. 2 graphs the base rates of encounter and the re-encounter rates separately. This figure reveals the generally large differences between these two measures, and therefore the generally large effect of autocorrelation in location on re-encounter rate. As expected, this autocorrelation effect diminished as walking distance increased, eventually being eliminated once agents walked so far that the locations were no longer autocorrelated (d = 1, non-spatial baseline); see right-most columns in Fig. 2. Note that when locations were no longer autocorrelated raw re-encounter rates were still sometimes sizeable. Nonetheless, they were no different than encounter base rates, showing that autocorrelation was not the cause of these high re-encounter rates. Walking distance accounted for 16.6% of the variance in the autocorrelation effect (Table 2). Cue-Value of Encounter 15  Also as expected, within each walking distance lower values of the meeting radius led to a smaller autocorrelation effect; see Fig. 2. Although we did not conduct simulations analogous to the walking distance case where autocorrelation is entirely removed, reflection can illustrate this for meeting radius. Imagine that meeting radius is reduced to zero. Agents never meet any other agents, necessarily eliminating the differences between re-encounter rates and encounter base rates, as both are zero. Meeting radius accounted for 11.2% of the variance in the autocorrelation effect (Table 2). There was also a small recency effect observed most in large walking distances and large meeting radii, which can be seen in the upward trending slopes before the end of life declines in Figs 1c & 1d. The autocorrelation effect reached a maximum for recent time steps and dissipated as the encounter faded back into the past. Finally, we note that there was little effect of whether edges stopped movement or whether edges wrapped seamlessly (see Tables 1 and 2).  Discussion The simulation presented here rests on extremely plausible, extremely minimal assumptions: If the world has spatial extent, is large relative to agents’ ability to navigate in it, and an agent’s time horizon extends beyond the immediate present, then merely encountering an agent once predicts a higher chance of encountering them again. These minimal assumptions were almost certainly true throughout human evolution. This suggests that natural selection will have calibrated our cooperative psychology in light of these realities. It is exceedingly simple for natural selection to exploit this environmental regularity to improve the performance of the cooperative architecture: in the absence of other information suggesting whether there will or will not be future interactions with an interaction partner, have a default expectation that re-Cue-Value of Encounter 16  encounter was the ancestral average1. These results obtain even when no organismal or environmental structure otherwise correlates agents’ movements. Yet in reality, both organism and environmental structure would strongly have correlated agents’ movements, thus greatly amplifying the degree to which an encounter predicted reencounter compared to the minimal case where agents are moving randomly. That is, unconnected foragers would have shared many of the same goals in the same local environment (e.g., different individuals frequently visited the same sources of food, water, shelter, refuge, mates). Any such structure, such as a common attractant like a stable resource patch or repellent like a stable environmental hazard, by systematically causing agents to cluster at or disperse from a particular location, would serve to increase the rate of re-encounter. For a species like humans where individuals possess specialized knowledge and skills such that the gains in trade from cooperation are often large, these results imply that—in order to cultivate such valuable relationships—the mind should be designed to assume by default that the probability of a repeat interaction with a newly encountered stranger is far greater than zero. Note that this reasoning does not predict that a default cooperative psychology should be common among species; we may share a spatial ecology with other species on the planet, but it is this ecological fact in concert with the possibility of large benefits through cooperation that can select for such a psychology. Delton et al.1 find that, under reasonable parameterization, cooperation in uncertain one-shot circumstances evolves only when the average gains in trade from cooperation are larger than two or three times the cost. While this is a low hurdle for particular instances of cooperation, it is hard to see how this could characterize the interactions of non-human animals on average throughout their lives.  Cue-Value of Encounter 17  Although we argue that re-encounter rate creates psychologies that (probably implicitly) assume or act as if interactions will be repeated, we are not arguing that this implies humans should always cooperate or be generous. In making any cooperative decision, the mind should integrate a number of situational cues along with any default assumptions. Some cues may make cooperation more likely: For instance, in laboratory samples of economic games, subjects in the experiments are often of similar age, attending the same school if not the same classes; in anthropological samples, subjects are often all members of the same face-to-face communities. In contrast, other cues may make cooperation less likely, such as a past history of aggressive interaction.  To be clear, these simulations suggest that selection acting on the human cooperative architecture might have had two different, related effects on its design. First, the evolutionary long-run degree to which one encounter predicted repeat encounters would have made the architecture’s default probability of cooperating higher than previously appreciated.  Second, the architecture might have been selected to include detection systems to monitor within-lifespan local parameters that provide cues to the degree to which one encounter predicts another. This would suggest that greater autocorrelation in location (less travel) should increase cooperativeness.  More importantly, this work is simply a modest illustration of how theories of cooperation (and any other psychological adaptation) need to be fleshed out by taking explicit account of the local material and informational ecologies. That such a minor factor as location autocorrelation can potentially shift best-bet reciprocity responses suggests that when all relevant features of the world are taken into account, an efficient reciprocity–exchange architecture might look very different than how it is usually conceived.  Cue-Value of Encounter 18  Beyond evidence that humans often cooperate in one-shot and anonymous interactions, stable cross-cultural differences in cooperative behaviors have also been advanced to support cultural group selection and gene–culture co-evolutionary theories of human cooperation6,44. These proposals argue, not implausibly, that differential rates of cooperative behaviors across societies are due to these societies having different cultural norms and institutions. But although viable, a cultural explanation is not the only possible explanation. An alternative explanation would be that the same universal evolved cooperative architecture is designed to be calibrated by the detection of local magnitudes of ecological factors that affected the payoffs of cooperative relationships ancestrally. For example, stable differences in the numbers of social partners and kin present in the vicinity are plausible input parameters to facultative mechanisms for cooperativeness and generosity—factors that themselves might be partial functions of the degree of autocorrelation in location. That is, what are commonly interpreted as “cultural differences” may turn out to be outputs produced by ecological and demographic inputs to our evolved psychology. In support of this view, recent research suggests that variance comparable to that found between cultures can also be found among communities of a single culture—communities that share the same norms and institutions7. If different locations in the same culture present the same variability as different cultures do, this implies that noncultural factors could be responsible for between culture variability as well.  Mathematical and simulation work also provides alternative explanations for cross-cultural differences, explanations that do not rely on higher-order levels of selection. Delton et al.1 show that cooperation, even in apparent one-shot encounters, increases as the gains in trade from cooperation increase. Although humans, compared to other species, have flourished by finding and exploiting possible gains in trade, modern societies have unlocked enormous gains in Cue-Value of Encounter 19  trade not possible in small-scale, face-to-face societies. On this view, it is not surprising that behaviors like cooperation and generosity are observed at higher rates in societies with (e.g.) more market integration44. To be clear, what is at issue is not whether humans have developed novel institutions and cultural practices that make modern life possible. What is at issue is why human cooperation and generosity exist and vary as they do. We suggest that human cooperation and generosity are not an accident of birth, a lucky draw in a lottery of cultural milieus. Instead, they are facultative elements in a universal human nature.

Positive interactions such as novel mutualisms can affect the fitness of organisms in invaded communities. Non-natives can augment native mutualism networks, replace extinct native partners, or disrupt native mutualisms. Because they are actively forming or newly formed, novel mutualisms offer a unique opportunity to examine in real time the factors governing early mutualism formation and stability, including frequency-dependent processes and those relying on specific traits or functions. These central ecological questions have been inferred from long-formed mutualisms, but novel mutualisms may allow a glimpse of successes and failures in ecological time with insights into the relative importance of these factors as ecological systems shift. To this end, this commentary addresses how novel mutualisms inform our understanding of mutualism formation, stability, the importance of functional traits, and niche vs. neutral processes, using examples across multiple systems.

Prior research finds that people can detect these signs of altruism in strangers, but we do not yet know whether this results in altruism homophily. We argue that dispositions should matter less in repeated interactions, where behavior is based on reciprocity. As a consequence, we should not expect people to have accurate insight into the dispositions (egoism vs. altruism) of their friends, nor should we expect these relations to be characterized by altruism homophily. Three studies, employing diverse methodologies and measures, find no evidence of altruism homophily. Moreover, we find that people have poor insight into their friends ’ altruism.

Enhanced Mutualism Hypothesis,103542834,The Psychology of Coordination and Common Knowledge,,"Kyle A. Thomas, Peter Descioli, Omar Sultan Haque, Steven Pinker",2016,"Research on human cooperation has concentrated on the puzzle of altruism, in which 1 actor incurs a cost to benefit another, and the psychology of reciprocity, which evolved to solve this problem. We examine the complementary puzzle of mutualism, in which actors can benefit each other simultaneously, and the psychology of coordination, which ensures such benefits. Coordination is facilitated by common knowl-edge: the recursive belief state in which A knows X, B knows X, A knows that B knows X, B knows that A knows X, ad infinitum. We test whether people are sensitive to common knowledge when deciding whether to engage in risky coordination. Participants decided between working alone for a certain profit and working together for a potentially higher profit that they would receive only if their partner made the same choice. Results showed that more participants attempted risky coordination when they and their prospective partner had common knowledge of the payoffs (broadcast over a loudspeaker) than when they had only shared knowledge (conveyed to both by a messenger) or private knowledge (revealed to each partner separately). These results support the hypothesis that people represent common knowledge as a distinct cognitive category that licenses them to coordinate with others for mutual gain. We discuss how this hypothesis can provide a unified explanation for diverse phenomena in human social life, including recursive mentalizing, performative speech acts, public protests, hypocrisy, and self-conscious emotional expressions",,text,"common knowledge, coordination, theory of mind, cooperation",,

We develop an evolutionary dynamics model to investigate how network homophily influences the evolution of the pay-it-forward reciprocity. Manipulating the extent to which actors carrying the same behavioral trait are linked in networks, the computer simulation model shows that strong network homophily helps consolidate the adaptive advantage of cooperation, yet introducing some heterophily to the formation of network helps advance cooperation's scale further.

Many studies have been developed using the unitary agent assumption, which embeds the idea that when making decisions, individuals share the same socio-cultural parameters. In this paper, we propose the ECHO-EGN model, based on Evolutionary Game Theory, which relaxes this strong assumption by considering the heterogeneity of three fundamental socio-cultural aspects ruling the behavior of groups of people: the propensity to be more cooperative with members of the same group (Endogamic cooperation), the propensity to cooperate with the public domain (Civicness) and the propensity to prefer connections with members of the same group (Homophily). The ECHO-EGN model is shown to have high performance in describing real world behavior of interacting individuals living in complex environments. Extensive numerical experiments allowing the comparison of real data and model simulations confirmed that the introduction of the above mechanisms enhances the realism in the modelling of cooperation dynamics.

However, what makes this mechanism so powerful also has an evolutionary downside. Reciprocal cooperation faces a chicken-and-egg problem of the same kind as communication: it requires two functions to evolve at the same time—cooperation and response to cooperation. As a result, it can only emerge if one side first evolves for another reason, and is then recycled into a reciprocal function. Developing an evolutionary model in which we make use of machine learning techniques, we show that this occurs if the fact to cooperate and reward others’ cooperation become general abilities that extend beyond the set of contexts for which they have initially been selected. Drawing on an evolutionary analogy with the concept of generalization, we identify the conditions necessary for this to happen. This allows us to understand the peculiar distribution of reciprocal cooperation in the wild, virtually absent in most species—or limited to situations where individuals have partially overlapping interests, but pervasive in the human species",,info:eu-repo/semantics/article,,,'The Royal Society'

Theoretical progress on the population dynamics of mutualistic interactions, however, comparatively lagged behind that of trophic and competitive interactions, leading to the impression that ecologists still lack a generalized framework to investigate the population dynamics of mutualisms. Yet, over the last 90 years, abundant theoretical work has accumulated, ranging from abstract to detailed. Here, we review and synthesize historical models of two‐species mutualisms. We find that population dynamics of mutualisms are qualitatively robust across derivations, including levels of detail, types of benefit, and inspiring systems. Specifically, mutualisms tend to exhibit stable coexistence at high density and destabilizing thresholds at low density. These dynamics emerge when benefits of mutualism saturate, whether due to intrinsic or extrinsic density dependence in intraspecific processes, interspecific processes, or both. We distinguish between thresholds resulting from Allee effects, low partner density, and high partner density, and their mathematical and conceptual causes. Our synthesis suggests that there exists a robust population dynamic theory of mutualism that can make general predictions.Theoretical progress on the ecology of mutualistic interactions comparatively lagged behind that of trophic and competitive interactions, leading to the impression that ecologists still lack a generalized framework to investigate the population dynamics of mutualisms.

Enhanced Mutualism Hypothesis,540159983,Effects of Relatedness on the Evolution of Cooperation in Nonlinear Public Goods Games,10.3390/g9040087,Kira Coder Gylling,2018,"Evolution of cooperation has traditionally been studied by assuming that individuals adopt either of two pure strategies, to cooperate or defect. Recent work has considered continuous cooperative investments, turning full cooperation and full defection into two opposing ends of a spectrum and sometimes allowing for the emergence of the traditionally-studied pure strategies through evolutionary diversification. These studies have typically assumed a well-mixed population in which individuals are encountered with equal probability. Here, we allow for the possibility of assortative interactions by assuming that, with specified probabilities, an individual interacts with one or more other individuals of the same strategy. A closely related assumption has previously been made in evolutionary game theory and has been interpreted in terms of relatedness. We systematically study the effect of relatedness and find, among other conclusions, that the scope for evolutionary branching is reduced by either higher average degree of, or higher uncertainty in, relatedness with interaction partners. We also determine how different types of non-linear dependencies of benefits and costs constrain the types of evolutionary outcomes that can occur. While our results overall corroborate the conclusions of earlier studies, i.e. higher relatedness promotes the evolution of cooperation, our investigation gives a comprehensive picture of how relatedness affects the evolution of cooperation with continuous investments",,Text,adaptive dynamics; evolution; cooperation,,'MDPI AG'

Enhanced Mutualism Hypothesis,91526158,The Evolutionary Ecology of Mutualism,,"Ivens, A.B.F.",2012,"Mutualism, cooperation between different species, is wide-spread in nature. From bees pollinating plants to bacteria aiding digestion in the human gut: mutualism is essential for life on earth. But how does mutualism evolve? And what mechanisms keep mutualisms stable over evolutionary time and prevent mutualistic partners from parasitising each other? Here, these questions are explored using both computer models that mimic evolution and a detailed ecological study of one particular kind of mutualism, farming mutualism, in which one species ‘farms’ another species for food. The underground Yellow meadow ant tends various root aphids in its nest for ‘milk’ (the sugary honeydew that aphids excrete) and ‘meat’ (by eating the aphids). In return, the ants build aphid chambers in their nest and protect the aphids actively from predators. My detailed studies of this farming mutualism on the isle of Schiermonnikoog (NL) surprisingly showed that the most common species of root aphids reproduce predominantly clonally and that they rarely disperse. The studies also show that in most aphid chambers only a single clone of aphids occurs, belonging to a single species. Interestingly, this latter example of ‘monoculture farming’ in combination with clonal reproduction of the ‘crop’ or ‘cattle’ is frequently observed in farming mutualisms. In addition, the computer simulations show that cooperative behaviour can evolve under certain conditions under which partners are able to choose with whom to cooperate. Moreover, these models show that mutualism can readily evolve when interactions are initially based on by-products, for example the honeydew of aphids",,info:eu-repo/semantics/doctoralthesis,,,

In our first model, cooperation consists of the production of a public good, and adversity is linked to the degree of complementarity of the players' efforts in producing the public good. In our second model, cooperation consists of the defense of a public, and/or a private good with by-product benefits, and adversity is measured by the number of random attacks (e.g., by a predator) facing the players. In both of these models, our analysis confirms the existence of the so-called boomerang effect, which states that in a harsh environment, the individual player has few incentives to unilaterally defect in a situation of joint cooperation. Focusing on such an effect in isolation leads to the """"common-enemy"""" hypothesis that a larger degree of adversity increases the probability of cooperation. Yet, we also find that a sucker effect may simultaneously exist, which says that in a harsh environment, the individual player has few incentives to unilaterally cooperate in a situation of joint defection.

Recognizing how variation in dependence influences the stability, breakdown, and context dependence of mutualisms generates new hypotheses regarding how and why the benefits of mutualistic partnerships differ over time and space",,"Article, PeerReviewed",,Annual Review of Ecology Evolution and Systematics,'Annual Reviews'

There is a broad range of interdisciplinary literature (Everett et al.2015 and bibliography therein cited), interested in explaining such in-group bias. Everett etal.(2015) explore in particular to what extent this behavior is driven by preferences for thewelfare of the one own's group or from the beliefs of future reciprocal action by their own,as well as the outside group.In this context, a key concept is that of social identity (Taifel, 1974), according to whicha social group is deﬁned as the collection of individuals who perceive to be a member of thesame category sharing common objective or subjective criteria (nationality, gender, jobs,etc.). Bidirectional actions deﬁne the social identity, i.e. cooperation, which implies thepayment of a cost regarding the eﬀorts devoted to realizing a common outcome which willbeneﬁt all members, namely themselves and the other group members (Dovidio et al., 2006).The whole outcome of this cooperation is strongly related to the agents' eﬀort and there-fore to the potential team members showing to work synergistically (Alchian and Demsetz,1972). The individual beneﬁts, instead, can be perceived as immediate or related to repu-tational concerns. In the literature on the reputation-based cooperation (see Everett et al.2015, as well as their bibliography), the most relevant input to push cooperative actions arethe beliefs that the others will reciprocate now or later. In this context, it is important togive a signal to be perceived as a trustworthy person.Milinski et al. (2002) show that with the goal of building a good reputation peoplecooperate more when they have to contribute to the public good formation, and the Tragedyof Commons never applies. This cooperation is usually stronger towards in-group members,as giving a good signal about themselves implies higher possibilities to be reciprocated fromthose who share the same social identity (Everett et al.,2015).Apparently this in-group bias can generate negative externalities for the outside groupas the preferential in group treatments are usually done at the expenses of the outsiders,also concerning reduced cooperation. According to Sheremeta (2015), in order to succeedpeople tend to cooperate more with the others in the same group but, as the eﬀort is not3costless, they may tend to freeride with the members of the same group and become morecompetitive towards the outside groups. The author argues that the main factors aﬀectingthese results are related to group size, sharing rule, interactions context and social impactfunction, heterogeneity of players. As pointed out by Everett et al. (2015), it is unclearwhether the cause of this ingroup bias is to be found in preferences related the welfare ofingroup members or in beliefs about the behavior of ingroup and outgroup members.In this work, by analyzing cooperation between and within groups, we focus on the issueof reputational concerns and indirect reciprocity (Alexander, 1987; Nowak and Sigmund,1998, 2005). Naturally, indirect reciprocity happens when individuals decide to make coop-erative and helpful actions towards others in a strategic way to build up a positive personalreputation because they will need help, at some point, from the others. As Nietzsche willput it, it is the selﬁshness of the generous.Harris et al. (2015) show that when ingroup bias is dangerous towards the outsiders,some mechanisms of punishment are necessary to set up and share broader ethical socialnorms across groups. Nevertheless other authors, by incorporating social preferences into theeconomic approach, show that some individuals do help others even when their help is not intheir interest (Camerer and Fehr, 2004). In other words, other-regarding preferences do driveindividuals (at least some of them) in their choices towards the well-being of others, as wellas fairness and reciprocity (Fehr and Schmidt, 1999; Charness and Rabin, 2002; Camerer,2003). In this work, we try to enlighten some additional insights about reputation-basedin-group favoritism. We investigate through a dynamical model the eﬀect of a share of in-group members with a pro-social attitude towards the outsiders. In particular, we analyzea situation where two groups in society must cooperate to realize a joint project, whichneeds the eﬀort of both groups to be completed successfully in a given period. Some typicalexamples of this situation are the cooperation among sectors in the same organization,departments of a University, ethnic majorities and minorities (e.g. migrants) living in thesame country, and so on.As the returns can be diﬀerent from the two groups, taking too much care just to thein-group reputation may be counterproductive, leading to low eﬀorts to cooperate with theoutside group. This """"narrow rep thinking"""" will result in a less cohesive social aggregation,4preventing the realization of a multicultural social paradigm. Nevertheless, according tothe literature on other-regarding preferences, when there exists at least a minimal share ofin-group members, reputational concerns can be driven in the direction of a more frequentcooperation with external groups.The paper is divided into ﬁve Sections, including Introduction and Conclusions. InSection 2 we introduce the basic features of our dynamical model and discusses the primaryvariables aﬀecting between and within group cooperation. In part 3 we explore how theexistence of this minimal share can boost speciﬁc between-group eﬀorts for the realizationof a joint project. We ﬁnd that two eﬀects are at work: it can either boost betweengroupcooperation and outsiders free-riding. This suggests a more cautious altruism requiring athreshold for the eﬀort from the outsiders to activate this minimal share of altruistic people.In Section 4 we also compare this eﬀect with the case of coercive cooperation by applying apenalty on the returns of the less cooperative agent in the ﬁrst group. We ﬁnd that this wayto boost cooperation is usually ineﬃcient in the presence of the signiﬁcant sized majoritiesor feelings of resentments. Section 5 concludes.2 The modelWe consider two groups of n1 and n2 individuals, who are engaged in a common projectwhich needs the joint eﬀorts of both groups to be completed in a given period of time T .Each group is characterized by his social identity, which is stronger in the ﬁrst one so thatwe may assume that only the ﬁrst group utility depends on reputational concerns.We assume that two new individuals entering in the project must decide how much eﬀortput in the in-group or betweengroups cooperation, as the full return from the project foreach new agent can be measured as the sum of shares of the single additional returns r1 andr2, due to their marginal contribution, related to withingroups cooperation. The action ofmaking an eﬀort has clearly a cost, which we assume to be constant over time, denoted bya1 and a2 for a representative agent in the ﬁrst and in the second group, respectively. Wealso assume in time that u1 and u2 are the maximum exogenous level of eﬀort for the agent5in each group.According to these assumptions we solve a dynamical game between the agents in thetwo groups where the ﬁrst one solves:maxu1∫ T0e−ρt[r1n1u1(t)u2(t)− α1u21(t)− α2u22(t) + n1R(t)+r2n2(u1 − u1(t))(u2 − u2(t))− α1(u1 − u1(t))2 − α2(u2 − u2(t))2]dt, (1)where the control u1 takes values in [0, u1] ∈ R, u2 in [0, u2] ∈ R and the state R is ruled byR′(t) = −δR(t) + cu1(t)− ku2(t)R(0) = R0 > 0.(2)In the above equation c and k are positive constants, while δ is the depreciation rate.This last measures the individual's needs for distinctiveness and diﬀerentiation from others(For instance, according to Brewer, 1991, individuals also avoid self-construals that areeither too personalized or too inclusive and instead deﬁne themselves in terms of distinctivecategory memberships) and also the needs to be awarded for their own skills and originalcontribution w.r.t. the project, or to avoid alienation, etc.The term ku2 measures the disruption eﬀect on the Social identity of the ﬁrst group. Inother words, we assume that a social identity is disrupted when the other group is highlycooperative, so that integration and reciprocity towards it is higher and there is the threatof rejection for those in the majority who on turn do not reciprocate with the outsider. Thisis a sort of bridging (or inclusive) social capital(Putnam, 2000) that, unlike the bondingsocial capital which may be more inward looking and have a tendency to reinforce exclusiveidentities and homogeneous groups, instead it may be more outward-looking and encompasspeople across diﬀerent social divides.The second player solvesmaxu2∫ T0e−ρt[r1n1u1(t)u2(t)− α1u21(t)− α2u22(t)− n1R(t)+r2n2(u1 − u1(t))(u2 − u2(t))− α1(u1 − u1(t))2 − α2(u2 − u2(t))2]dt, (3)where again the state R is ruled by (2).6We remark that for the second agent we subtract n1R since it represents an opportunitycost that is not necessary for the project itself.We consider the Hamiltonian function, given u2 associated to (1)(2)H(t, u1, R, λ) = r1n1u1u2 − α1u21 − α2u22 + n1R+r2n2(u1 − u1)(u2 − u2)− α1(u1 − u1)2 − α2(u2 − u2)2 + λ(−δR+ cu1 − ku2).Maximizing the Hamiltonian function with respect to u1 we obtain that it is maximized atu∗1 given byu∗1(t) = C1 + C2u2(t) + C3λ(t) (4)whereC1 =u12− r2n2u24α1, C2 =r1n1 + r2n24α1and C3 =c4α1. (5)Therefore, the optimal level of the eﬀort for the ﬁrst group to cooperate with their ownmembers mainly depends:• Positively on the owngroup size (and negatively on the outsidegroup size). In theliterature, the exact eﬀect of group size is controversial enough. According to some the-oretical predictions, large numbers facilitate free-riding behaviors among their mem-bers. In this case, the enhancement of cooperation with outsiders and the reduction ofreputation concerns could be more probable. On the contrary, other experimental re-sults show that for large sized majorities the social identity is stronger and cooperationwithin group higher, while it is nearly impossible to be well integrated for minorities(see Sheremeta 2015 for a survey on both theoretical and empirical analyses). Ourtheoretical result shows a positive eﬀect of the group size which strongly depends onthe relevance of reputation concerns if returns from the ﬁrst group are consistent.• Positively on the eﬀort of the other group proportionally to their full returns. Thismeans that the more is Group 2 cooperative with Group 1, the higher is the incentive ofthe latter to reciprocate and produce within this group while the cooperation with theoutside group lessens. We can hence see how the outsiders are considered as a supportto the improvement of the """"small closed society"""" rather than a possible partner tocooperate.7• As the maximum possible eﬀort of the second group increases, the optimal u1 de-creases, because when it is high enough the ﬁrst group can freeride when cooperatingwith the second one, also when returns r2 are large enough.• Positively on the reputational concerns c through the shadow price λ.The co-state λ solves:λ′(t) = ρλ(t)− ∂H∂R= (ρ+ δ)λ(t)− n1, (6)together with the transversality conditionλ(T ) = 0. (7)From (6) and (7) we ﬁndλ(t) =n1ρ+ δ[1− e(ρ+δ)(t−T )]. (8)As far as the second agent is concerned, substituting (4) in (3) we maximize with respectto u2 the Hamiltonian functionH(t, u2, R, µ) = r1n1u∗1u2 − α1u∗12 − α2u22 − n1R+r2n2(u1 − u∗1)(u2 − u2)− α1(u1 − u∗1)2 − α2(u2 − u2)2 + µ(−δR+ cu∗1 − ku2).Hence we get the F.O.C.∂H∂u2= [2(r1n1 + r2n2)C2 − 4α1C22 − 4α2]u2+(2α2 − r2n2)u2 + (2α1C2 − r2n2)u1 + +cC2µ = 0,the co-state µ solvesµ′(t) = ρµ(t)− ∂H∂R= (ρ+ δ)µ(t) + n1, (9)and satisﬁes the transversality conditionµ(T ) = 0. (10)From (9) and (10), we ﬁndµ(t) =n1ρ+ δ[e(ρ+δ)(t−T ) − 1]. (11)8Notice that µ = −λ as expected, having the ﬁrst group reputational concerns R oppositeeﬀects on the two similar players in diverse group. In fact, it represents a cost for the secondgroup and a beneﬁt for the ﬁrst one.Recalling that 4α1C2 = r1n1 + r2n2 we have∂H∂u2= 4(α1C22 − α2)u2 + (2α2 − r2n2C2)u2 + (2α1C2 − r2n2)u1 + (cC2 − k)µ = 0,In order to maximize H we assume C22 <α2α1(which implies that the costs of eﬀort tocooperate with the ﬁrst group are higher enough w.r.t the returns to still make convenientcooperate with the one own's group, otherwise the player 2 would put the maximum eﬀortonly in the ﬁrst one) and we derive that the maximum is attained at u∗2 deﬁned asu∗2(t) =(2α2 − r2n2C2)u2 + (2α1C2 − r2n2)u1 + (cC2 − k)µ(t)4(α2 − α1C22 )(12)• Notice that for the representative agent in the second group, for high values of n2r2,the highest costs of eﬀort may reduce the amount of it that the player wants to provide.In general, these costs can be very high for minorities due to extrinsic factors (for in-stance diverse infrastructure for people in diﬀerent countries, diﬀerence in language forminorities ethnical groups, etc.). Removing these unfair costs, through a multiculturalparadigm promoting more integration, could be convenient for the organization whenbetter minority performance can recover them and realize a more common proﬁtableproject.• Moreover, for higher values of r2 (e the group size n2) the outsider may freeride w.r.this own group and contribute more with the other one.• On the other side, the disruption eﬀect k is negative because it needs less eﬀort tohave great inﬂuence on the behaviour of the ﬁrst group and weaken his social identity,so that the outsider can cooperate more with his own group.• Finallly, as expected, the positive eﬀect of c on the optimal level of the eﬀorts, concernsboth the ﬁrst and the second group and this last through the shadow price µ. Forhigh values of r1 and n1, people in the minority group must contribute with highereﬀorts with the ﬁrst group to be integrated but u2 increases also because that group9is working hard only with their peers and cooperation with them become the mainway to realize the project, instead of working with their own group.3 Cooperation among groups may be boosted by smallshares of individuals with pro-social attitudes towardsthe outsiders.As the possible maximum eﬀort of the second group increases, the optimal u1 decreases,because when it is high enough the ﬁrst group can freeride when cooperating with thesecond one, even if returns r2 are large enough.Cooperation among groups may be boosted by small shares of individuals with pro-socialattitudes towards the outsiders.Our results found in the previous Section show that also when the second group ishighly productive, and it could be eﬃcient to cooperate more with it, this cooperation maybe sharply limited because of the ﬁrst group reputational concerns c. If we imagine a morecohesive society, with a hypothetical social planner who sets up the levels of the eﬀorts thatboth the agents should provide to realize a shared proﬁtable project, it will solve a simpleintertemporal maximization problem without any small hint of motion on R. In this way,the optimal values of u1 and u2 would depend only on the returns, costs and size of bothgroups(more details on these results are available upon request).According to some authors (see for instance Sheremeta, 2015 and bibliography thereincited) when this is the case, a mechanism of punishment could enforce cooperation betweengroups. In this paper we want to explore another less coercive solution to build a morecohesive society where the only relevant concerns are about the project realization by eachmember. In particular, we aim to investigate a case where cooperation among groups canbe pushed up by small shares of individuals with pro-social attitudes towards the outsiders.Speciﬁcally, in this Section, we analyze how the dissemination of good practices betweengroups by a small proportion of individuals with other-regarding preferences can boostcooperation through a kind of """"imitation eﬀect"""". Such a result may arise since it pushes10collaboration with diﬀerent types of stakeholders (Becchetti, 2007). This promotion towardshybrid collaboration can happen at the corporate level, i.e. the so-called """"social market en-terprises"""" like fair traders(Becchetti, 2007); but also at a social level when migration policiesor social incentives are put in place to smooth social conﬂicts and push individuals towardsintegration. Similarly, in our case we can see how this share of individuals with other-regarding preferences can limit the reputational concerns, hence encouraging collaborationwith outsiders.Under these assumptions, in this revised version of the model the two players solve thesame maximization problems as in the previous Section but where R is now ruled by:R′(t) = −δR(t) + cu1(t)− ku2(t) + s(u1 − u1(t))R(0) = R0 > 0.(13)where s is a positive constant measuring the share or the sensitivity of the ﬁrst groupmembers to the cooperation with the outsiders(between group reciprocity).Proceeding as in the previous Section, we ﬁnd:u∗∗1 (t) = C1 + C2u2(t) + C3λ(t) (14)where the costate variable λ is the given by (8), the constants C1, C2 are deﬁned in (5) andrecalling C3 we setC3 =c− s4α1= C3 − s4α1Therefore it is:u∗∗1 (t) = u∗1(t)−s4α1λ(t) (15)Similarly, for the second player, we get:u∗∗2 (t) =(2α2 − r2n2C2)u2 + (2α1C2 − r2n2)u1 + [(c− s)C2 − k]µ(t)4(α2 − α1C22 ), (16)where the costate µ is deﬁned in (11).1. The share s of altruistic agents in the group boosts cooperation towards the outsiders:as expected, it reduces the optimal value of u1 through a decrease in the reputationalconcerns by an amount c − s, and consequently it increases the optimal eﬀort tocontribute with the outside group.112. The share s of altruistic agents may also boost outsiders' free-riding.The eﬀect of areduced u1 is controversial as it depends also on the reaction of the other agent,that is on the new optimal level of the endogenous variable u2. This depends on theexistence of free-riding towards the ﬁrst group. In other words, the eﬀect of the shares on the optimal value of u2 is not unambiguous: this value decreases as c− s raises.Therefore the ousider representative agent contributes less in the ﬁrst group, as theeﬀect of reputational concerns and social identity is weaker and he can free-ride fromthe others' augmented cooperation-integration (in this context by free-riding we meanthat the outsider becomes more competitive in the ﬁrst group and more cooperativewith his own group). This eﬀect is lower for low values of the disruption variable k.The issue of the free riding problem inside a group has been broadly analyzed in Olson'swork (1965), who claims that free riding in a group is more likely to happen if a groupendeavors collective action to provide public goods. On the contrary, individuals will notfreeride against the eﬀorts of the others, if the group will procure beneﬁts to active members.Indeed, when freeriding happens, collective action is impossible, even if there are commoninterests and dependance among group members. Olson identiﬁed incentives like selectiverewards and coercive participation as the only ways to solve out the free-riding problem.In this Section instead, we show that there exists the possibility to have a freeridingissue between groups. In fact, we see that the share of altruistic people in the ﬁrst groupmay boost free-riding behavior from the outsiders towards the ﬁrst group itself. Our resultsshow that the full eﬀect depends on two combined forces acting in the same direction, i.e.increased cooperation from the ﬁrst group versus the outsiders can count either on the""""imitation eﬀect"""" of the generous people or the increased free-riding from the second one.The ﬁrst eﬀect prevails for very low values of k, holding other things constant.Otherwise, it seems suitable, in such context, to follow Olson's proposal (1965) to bealtruistic only with the outsider who will in turn procure beneﬁts to the active members.In our model this implies to add an activation constraint such that the law of motion of RbecomesR′(t) = −δR(t) + cu1(t)− ku2(t) + s(u1 − u1(t))12where s > 0 iff u2 ≥ u˜20 otherwise (17)The ﬁrst group sets the value of u˜2 considering the possibility and necessary contributionto request from the outsiders to be integrated in the ﬁrst group and to realize the return r1from the common project (for instance it could be u˜2 = u∗2).4 Coercive vs altruistic cooperation towards the out-sidersIn this Section, we consider that diﬀerent solutions have been proposed to solve out theproblem of free riding. In Olson's work (1965) even coercive participation may be a wayto remediate to the free-riding problem. Therefore, we wonder if a similar solution can beapplied to enhance cooperation from the ﬁrst group towards the second one.The usual two diﬀerent approaches are the coercive and cooperative enforcement strate-gies. In general, human societies are constituted by a set of collaborative and coerciveorders that coexist, sometimes in a harmonic way, other times they conﬂict. For example,social and institutional innovations that allow individuals to improve their living conditionsoften develop without the need of coercive power to impose the respect of particular rules.Individuals are aware of the beneﬁts and spontaneously accept them. On the contrary,sometimes a cooperative society cannot exist without a coercive power able to impose somenew rules. Furthermore sometimes the intervention of coercive power is necessary to re-move barriers to new joint and social stability cooperation (Montani,2008). Functionally,punishment, also referred to as negative reciprocity, coercion, etc., is likely to be essentialfor maintaining cooperation. Third-party punishment, where the costs are borne by theindividual but the beneﬁts accrue to the group, has received recent theoretical interest andhas been suggested to be essential to human cooperation (e.g. Fehr and Fischbacher 2003;Fehr and Gachter 2000; Bowles and Gintis 2003; Boyd et al. 2003). This eﬀective punish-ment can be a fundamental pivot of non-kin cooperation when considering an occurrance13that belongs only to human beings. On one hand, positive sentiments - empathy, generosityand so on can lead individuals to prosocial actions towards strangers; on the other, negativefeelings, like spite and sensitivity to unfairness, can play a pivotal role too. In fact, they canpush individuals to punishment against free-riders (e.g. Fehr and Fischbacher 2003; Boydet al. 2005; Tomasello et al. 2005; Hill et al. 2009).Nevertheless, there is also evidence in the literature showing that commitment to abid-ance can make sanctions counter-productive, spreading bitter feelings among regulated fa-cilities with the consequent unwillingness to cooperate with regulators in the future (Burbyand Paterson, 1993). In many contexts, a coercive response to these events may breedstrong resentments. Burby and Paterson (1993) study the best strategy to increase com-pliance either with the performance standard or with speciﬁcation standard. According totheir ﬁndings, a cooperative approach produces a higher impact regarding the compliancewith the performance standard. In several cases it is possible to create a collaborative orderwithout coercion but through sequential iterative processes (Axelrod and Hamilton, 1981)which lead to the manifestation of planned and desired cooperative behavior. Also, we canhypothesize situations, described by the prisoner's dilemma, some cases where individualscan change from noncooperation to cooperation by looking at the advantages from the re-ciprocal cooperation and reach an agreement. Conversely, Batson (1991) ﬁnds prosocialfeelings, e.g. empathy, a fundamental driver of prosocial actions towards newcomers.To take into account these considerations, we propose a slightly revised version of themodel, where a penalty φu1 is applied on the total return going to the subject of group one,proportional to the eﬀort he puts into his group, and that according to a hypothetical SocialPlanner it would have to go instead to another group. Hence now the player one solves:maxu1∫ T0e−ρt[r1n1u1(t)u2(t)− α1u21(t)− α2u22(t) + n1R(t)+r2n2(u1 − u1(t))(u2 − u2(t))− α1(u1 − u1(t))2 − α2(u2 − u2(t))2 − φu1]dt, (18)where φ is a positive constant and the state R is ruled by (2).Solving the above maximization problem and assuming that u2 is given and ﬁxed at the14necessary level to no make free riding, we get:uˇ1(t) = u∗1(t)−φ4α1(19)Therefore, exploiting (14), we derive that uˇ1(t) > u∗∗1 (t) if and only ifφ4α1< sλ(t)4α1 orφ < sλ(t).Recalling λ(t) in (8), we obtainφ < sn1ρ+ δ[1− e(ρ+δ)(t−T )].

In particular, when minorities have low per-formance and desire to integrate and high propensity to free riding, then it could be moreeﬃcient to choose a low-inclusive model which could also be more eﬀective if the fulﬁllmentof the group is very high. Nevertheless, it is more common to encounter the case wherecohesion among group members is pivotal for high performance at work while drifting to a15group think mechanism (Whyte, 1952) can be dangerous. In particular, when the minorityhas better performance, it would be better to enhance outside group cooperation. Someorganizations operate more eﬃciently with a homogeneous workforce while others are moreeﬃcient with a heterogeneous workforce.Our results suggest that when this is the case strategies for managing multiculturalorganizations, and a new social multicultural paradigm are necessary. In particular, weshow that the existence of a tiny share of prosocial players in the ﬁrst group can create asort of """"imitation eﬀect"""" such that each new individual in the group gives less emphasis topersonal reputation inside the group and puts more eﬀort in cooperating with the outsiders.On the other side, to avoid free-riding eﬀort should be conditional to the other's commitment.We also show that this way to boost cooperation is more eﬃcient than a coercive strategyin the presence of the signiﬁcant sized majorities or feelings of resentments. Therefore,according to our analysis, it could be appropriate, under some circumstances to stimulate amulticultural paradigm so as to increase the share of prosocial people in the majority group.There is substantial literature debating diverse groups and organizations performanceadvantages and disadvantages (see White, 1999). For instance, this usually happens whenmulticultural organizations: i)attract the highest quality of human resources, uphold andfurther the highest percentage of workers from diverse cultural backgrounds; ii) can under-stand and penetrate wider and enhanced (foreign) markets; iii) display greater creativityand innovation and a better problem-solving ability; iv) are better able to adapt to changeand exhibit more organizational ﬂexibility). Apparently, despite the compelling advantagespossessed by the multicultural organizations, when diversity is not managed in an eﬃcientmanner, it can result in dysfunctional outcomes. Inadequate communication, weak teamspirit, long decision timing and less team cohesion are more likely to arise in such cases. Thismechanism has the higher probability to happen when the social identity of the ﬁrst group isunyielding. Therefore cross-cultural training is necessary to enable culturally diverse groupsto live up to their potential and overcome communication diﬃculties. Therefore, managersin an organization or social planners in society should reconcile ambitious objectives, sustainthe identity of minority group members, scatter power in a representative way. Addition-ally, they should take actions when having abundant resources, and cultural diversities are16understood. Furthermore, in a society where diverse groups coincide there is the need forstrategies and programs to value and manage diversity through an acculturation process thatemphasizes two-way learning, adaptation, interdependence, and mutual appreciation of dif-ferent cultures. Also, an eﬃcient communication needs to exchange new ideas, grievances,input and feedback. Before new paradigms can be created, however, the cultural environ-ment has to experience greater acceptance, especially for evaluating in a positive way theinevitable change, as well as the challenge of an increasingly diverse society.17References[1] Alchian, d'Armen A. and Demsetz, H.(1972), """"Production, information costs, and eco-nomic organization"""", American Economic Review 62: 777-795.[2] Alexander, R.

A recent hypothesis advanced by Fahrig (2013) would, if supported, greatly diminish the relevance of habitat configuration as a predictor of diversity. The Habitat Amount Hypothesis posits that the sample area effect overrides patch size and patch isolation effects of habitat fragmentation on species richness. It predicts that the amount of habitat in a local landscape, regardless of configuration, is the main landscape-level determinant of species richness. If habitat amount is indeed the major, landscape-level driver of species richness, the slopes of the species–area relationship (SAR) for otherwise similar fragmented and unfragmented landscapes should be indistinguishable. We tested the Habitat Amount Hypothesis with data from two replicated and controlled habitat fragmentation experiments that disentangle the effects of habitat amount and configuration. One experiment provided time-series data on plant species richness and the other on micro-arthropod species richness. We found that, relative to less fragmented habitats, the SARs for fragmented habitats have significantly higher slopes and that the magnitude of the difference in slopes increased over time. Relatively more species were lost in smaller areas when fragments were more isolated. In both experiments, the proportion of species lost due to increased habitat fragmentation was nearly identical to the proportion lost due to reduced habitat amount. Our results provide a direct and experimentally derived refutation of the Habitat Amount Hypothesis, supporting the long-held view that in addition to area, patch isolation and configuration are important determinants of species richness. Differences in species richness between fragmented and non-fragmented habitats increase over time, demonstrating that long-term studies are needed to understand the effects of fragmentation, above and beyond the amount of habitat lost",,"Life sciences, medicine and health care","Life sciences, medicine and health care",,

habitat amount hypothesis,233211605,Habitat Size Mediates the Effects of Environmental Factors on Species Richness,,"Schuler, Matthew Scott",2015,"The Species Area Relationship (SAR) is one of the oldest and most fundamental patterns in ecology. Researchers have long known that a larger habitat will support more species than a smaller habitat. In the early 20th century, a predictive mathematical model was developed giving researchers an opportunity to understand the consequences of habitat loss for patterns of species richness and diversity. Species richness refers to the number of species observed within a given area. Related to species richness, species diversity is any statistical metric that allows researchers to compare species richness values measured across habitats that have varying probabilities of sampling individuals of the species present. Researchers have used the SAR model to understand the number of species that could be supported by a given amount of habitat, but have also used the SAR to compare the number of species supported by different habitats, to into infer important environmental factors that lead to differences in species richness among habitats. Ecologists have given great attention to studying the roles that these environmental factors play in determining how many species a given habitat will support. Yet, very little consideration has been given to the way in which habitat size alters the effects of those environmental factors on species richness patterns. This dissertation explores the influences that habitat size has on environmental factors that have been proposed as mechanisms that increase or maintain species richness in local habitats. I present three chapters each describing the findings of experiments that explored the interplay between habitat size and three commonly invoked mechanisms that affect local species richness: energy, species dispersal, and habitat heterogeneity. In Chapter 1, I present an experimental test of the species-energy-area relationship, where energy and area are predicted to interact in a positive way to increase the total number of species in a habitat. While much attention has been given to the interaction between habitat size and energy, researchers have failed to recognize that energy input may not be directly acting as a mechanism increasing species richness, but instead increasing the density of individuals, which increases the likelihood of detecting species in high-energy habitats. The 2nd chapter addresses the way in which habitat area alters the importance of dispersal for maintaining species richness in habitats, where small habitats are predicted to benefit more from dispersal than large habitats. Despite classical models in ecology predicting that species dispersal should be most important in small habitats, no conclusive experimental evidence exists showing that habitat size alters the importance of dispersal on species richness in local communities. Finally, in the 3rd chapter I present data from an experiment showing how the importance of habitat heterogeneity depends on habitat size and the aggregation of species among habitats. Habitat heterogeneity has been implicated as one of the most important mechanisms required to increase and maintain species richness in local communities. However, a meta-analysis of heterogeneity experiments revealed that experimental evidence is inconclusive, because many researchers have found positive and negative relationships between habitat heterogeneity and species richness. Additionally, the Area-Heterogeneity-Trade-Off (AHTO) model, developed to predict the relationship between habitat heterogeneity and species richness, has proven to be difficult to test in natural environments, due to the correlation of alternative environmental parameters with habitat heterogeneity. The results of this experiment support the main predictions of the AHTO, but show that the patterns predicted by the model can arise from alternative mechanisms than what the model predicts. The results from the experiments presented within this dissertation advance ecologists\u27 understanding of how environmental variables that are thought to drive patterns of species richness are mediated by the size of the habitat being studied. Furthermore, the results of these experiments add to a longstanding debate in ecology over the importance of habitat size in maintaining species richness. According to the SAR model, the reduction in size of a contiguous habitat will result in an immediate reduction in species richness. Some researchers have suggested, however, that the SAR model always under-predicts the loss of species richness as habitat size decreases. The research presented in this dissertation supports the conclusion that as habitat size decreases, species will be lost at a rate different from the prediction of the SAR model, due to the complex and non-linear relationships between habitat size and environmental factors like energy and heterogeneity that affect the number of species a local habitat could support",,text,"Aquatic Ecology, Community Ecology, Diversity, Biology",,Washington University Open Scholarship

Habitat structure may be conceived as being hierarchical, where larger, more diverse, portions or categories contain smaller, more homogeneous portions. When this conceptualization is combined with the observation that species have different abilities to  relate to portions of the habitat that differ in their characteristics, a number of known patterns can be derived and new patterns hypothesized. We propose a quantitative form of this habitat-species relationship by considering species abundance to be a function of habitat specialization, habitat fragmentation, amount of habitat, and adult body mass. The model reproduces and explains patterns such as variation in rank-abundance curves, greater variation and extinction probabilities of habitat specialists, discontinuities in traits (abundance, ecological range, pattern of variation, body size) among species sharing a community or area, and triangular distribution of body sizes, among others. The model has affinities to Holling's textural discontinuity hypothesis and metacommunity theory but  differs from both by offering a more general perspective.

(Nathan D.), Fahrig, L. (Lenore)",2016,"Context: Landscape structure shapes the genetic structure of populations by delimiting spatial patterns of dispersal and reproduction across generations. Thus, descriptions of human-altered landscapes can be used to predict demographic and evolutionary outcomes of populations. Effectively measuring landscape structure to predict genetic structure requires that we understand the relative importance of distinct components of landscape structure (e.g., habitat amount and configuration) in creating spatial patterns of genetic variation. Objectives: We thus developed an individual-based simulation model to test predictions about the relative importance of habitat amount and configuration in producing genetic structure. We also investigated the independent relationships between components of landscape structure and the population dynamics that underlie genetic effects. Methods: We ran experiments in which we allowed gene flow and population size to vary as emergent outcomes of the interactions between hypothetical populations and heterogeneous landscapes. Results: We found that the amount of habitat in a landscape is a much better predictor of genetic structure than is habitat configuration. This pattern holds across a range of landscapes and dispersal distances and behaviors. When habitat is non-contiguous (i.e., fragmented), habitat amount mediates production of genetic differentiation by regulating both the size and isolation of habitat patches, which in turn regulate population size and gene flow. Conclusions: These results suggest that habitat amount, a simple measure that is easy to calculate, may often be the best metric for predicting population genetic structure and that when possible, measures of habitat amount and population size should be incorporated into landscape genetic studies",,info:eu-repo/semantics/article,"Connectivity, Conservation genetics, Habitat fragmentation, Habitat loss, Individual-based model, Landscape metric",,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC'

Recently this has been challenged by the habitat amount and habitat continuum hypotheses, according to which persistence in modified landscapes is related to total habitat amount rather than habitat configuration or the ability of species to use all habitats to varying degrees. Distinguishing between these theories is essential for effective conservation planning in modified landscapes.Objective:Identify which factors of habitat type, amount and configuration predict the persistence of a keystone woodland specialist, the eastern bettong Bettongia gaimardi, in a fragmented landscape.Method:In the Midlands region of Tasmania we carried out camera surveys at 62 sites in summer and winter. We included habitat and landscape features to model whether habitat amount or patch size and isolation influenced the presence of the eastern bettong, and to measure effects of habitat quality.Results:Habitat amount within a 1 km buffer was a better predictor of occupancy than patch size and isolation. Occupancy was also affected by habitat quality, indicated by density of regenerating stems.Conclusion:Our results support the habitat amount hypothesis as a better predictor of presence. For a species that is able to cross the matrix between remnant patches and utilise multiple patches, the island biogeography concept does not explain habitat use in fragmented landscapes.

habitat amount hypothesis,56139550,Quantifying the effect of habitat availability on species distributions,,"Aarts, G.M., Fieberg, J., Brasseur, S.M.J.M., Matthiopoulos, J.",2013,"1.If animals moved randomly in space, the use of different habitats would be proportional to their availability. Hence, deviations from proportionality between use and availability are considered the tell-tale sign of preference. This principle forms the basis for most habitat selection and species distribution models fitted to use-availability or count data (e.g. MaxEnt and Resource Selection Functions). 2.Yet, once an essential habitat type is sufficiently abundant to meet an individual's needs, increased availability of this habitat type may lead to a decrease in the use/availability ratio. Accordingly, habitat selection functions may estimate negative coefficients when habitats are superabundant, incorrectly suggesting an apparent avoidance. Furthermore, not accounting for the effects of availability on habitat use may lead to poor predictions, particularly when applied to habitats that differ considerably from those for which data have been collected. 3.Using simulations, we show that habitat use varies non-linearly with habitat availability, even when individuals follow simple movement rules to acquire food and avoid risk. The results show that the impact of availability strongly depends on the type of habitat (e.g. whether it is essential or substitutable) and how it interacts with the distribution and availability of other habitats. 4.We demonstrate the utility of a variety of existing and new methods that enable the influence of habitat availability to be explicitly estimated. Models that allow for non-linear effects (using b-spline smoothers) and interactions between environmental covariates defining habitats and measures of their availability were best able to capture simulated patterns of habitat use across a range of environments. 5.An appealing aspect of some of the methods we discuss is that the relative influence of availability is not defined a priori, but directly estimated by the model.

For many animals, occupancy and density may be determined by distinct ecological processes. Here we develop a novel abundance model as the product of landscape-scale occupancy probability and habitat-scale density given occupancy. One can conceptualize our model as fully packing a landscape with home ranges or territories based on habitat quality, and then subtracting territories based on a probabilistic process that accounts for the fact that species rarely exhibit full occupancy across heterogeneous landscapes. The model is designed to predict abundance at fine spatial scales, using resolutions equal to or smaller than a single home range or territory. We demonstrate this model on the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), a species of management concern linked to post-fire forests. Occupancy is derived from a regional monitoring effort, while density given occupancy comes from a telemetry study of variation in territory size. A Bayesian framework is used to combine independent occupancy and home-range size models and predict abundance of Black-backed Woodpeckers at 4 fires that burned in 2012 or 2013. Predictions are evaluated with independently collected survey data, showing that the model is successful at predicting both absolute abundance at fires as well as relative abundance within and among fires. The conceptual model presents a promising new framework for fine-scale modeling of density and abundance for other territorial yet elusive species. Telemetry and occupancy data are widely collected for many species, but rarely utilized in combination, and the ecological exploration of the factors that determine occurrence versus home-range size may provide useful biological insight. As applied to the Black-backed Woodpecker, the model provides a tool for resource managers to explore trade-offs in retaining burned forest habitat versus managing for other post-fire goals, such as salvage logging or reforestation efforts that require snag removal",,Article,"Density, population size, wildlife habitat model, Bayesian, home range, Black- backed Woodpecker",,

habitat amount hypothesis,429665225,Habitat predictors of a vertebrate community in a fragmented neotropical landscape,,"Seetharaman, Keerthikrutha",2021,"Habitat is an area that allows a species to survive and thrive. Habitat loss and habitat modification are considered two major threats to species persistence. Habitat predictors are environmental conditions which dictate patterns in species occupancy and thereby community distribution. Understanding habitat predictors at multiple spatial scales can aid managers in directing conservation measures, predicting effects of habitat modification and advancing theoretical knowledge about the effects of habitat fragmentation. Habitat predictors of ground-dwelling Neotropical vertebrates at multiple spatial scales, especially landscape scales, are often poorly known. To fill this knowledge gap, I conducted a study in a fragmented forest landscape in Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica. In the 1960s, continuous tropical wet forests in my study area were burnt to clear land for cattle ranching. This process modified swathes of wet forests into smaller fragments surrounded by human-use areas. I chose 19 forests in this landscape situated in and around the Área de Conservacíon Guanacaste (ACG), a UNESCO World Heritage Site, documented vertebrates using camera traps and calculated habitat variables at the three spatial scales of camera trap point, forest and landscape using field measurements and remote sensing imagery. We documented 32 species of ground-dwelling vertebrates and calculated 13 aspects of the vertebrate community as response variables. We tested the ability of 12 habitat variables to explain variation in the community response variables using linear mixed effect modelling in an AIC-based model averaging framework. Our results show that different scales of habitat affect different aspects of the vertebrate community, highlighting a need for examination of multi-scale habitat variables. Habitat predictors at landscape scales were important to the widest range of vertebrate response variables. Our key results highlight that threatened species associated with areas of continuous forests and species richness were highest in forests surrounded by plantation matrix as opposed to pasture. Detections of species at higher trophic levels (e.g. large carnivores) increased with the amount of forested area within 2km of camera traps. Our study thus highlights the need to examine various aspects of a vertebrate community, not just species richness, in order to understand in-depth, the effects of habitat change.Science, Faculty ofZoology, Department ofGraduat",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/Text, Thesis/Dissertation",,,University of British Columbia

Assuming that (i) available space restricts predator body size, (ii) mass-specific energy needs of predators scale with their body size, and (iii) energy availability scales with prey biomass, we predicted that predator biomass per unit area would scale with habitat size (quarter-power exponent) and prey biomass (three-quarter–power exponent). We found that total predator biomass scaled with habitat size and prey resources as expected across 29 New Zealand rivers, such that a unit of habitat in a small ecosystem supported less predator biomass than an equivalent unit in a large ecosystem. The lower energetic costs of large body size likely mean that a unit of prey resource supports more biomass of large-bodied predators compared to small-bodied predators. Thus, contracting habitat size reduces the predator mass that can be supported because of constraints on predator body size, and this may be a powerful mechanism exacerbating reductions in biodiversity due to habitat loss",,Article,"Ecology, Freshwater",,

Brady, Martin Stjernman, Henrik G. Smith, Henrik G. Smith",2021,"Most landscapes are comprised of multiple habitat types differing in the biodiversity they contain. This is certainly true for human modified landscapes, which are often a mix of habitats managed with different intensity, semi-natural habitats and even pristine habitats. To understand fundamental questions of how the composition of such landscapes affects biodiversity conservation, and to evaluate biodiversity consequences of policies that affect the composition of landscapes, there is a need for models able to translate information on biodiversity from individual habitats to landscape-wide predictions. However, this is complicated by species richness not being additive. We constructed a model to help analyze and solve this problem based on two simple assumptions. Firstly, that a habitat can be characterized by the biological community inhabiting it; i.e., which species occur and at what densities. Secondly, that the probability of a species occurring in a particular unit of land is dictated by its average density in the associated habitats, its spatial aggregation, and the size of the land unit. This model leads to a multidimensional species-area relation (one dimension per habitat). If the goal is to maximize species diversity at the landscape scale (γ-diversity), within a fixed area or under a limited budget, the model can be used to find the optimal allocation of the different habitats. In general, the optimal solution depends on the total size of the species pool of the different habitats, but also their similarity (β-diversity). If habitats are complementary (high β), a mix is usually preferred, even if one habitat is poorer (lower α diversity in one habitat). The model lends itself to economic analyses of biodiversity problems, without the need to monetarize biodiversity value, i.e., cost-effectiveness analysis. Land prices and management costs will affect the solution, such that the model can be used to estimate the number of species gained in relation to expenditure on each habitat. We illustrate the utility of the model by applying it to agricultural landscapes in southern Sweden and demonstrate how empirical monitoring data can be used to find the best habitat allocation for biodiversity conservation within and between landscapes",,article,"species-area relation, biodiversity, landscape, mosaic, community, agri-environment schemes, General.

To this end, we jointly contrast the habitat amount hypothesis and countryside biogeography with patch size and isolation concepts from island biogeography. Location: Three multi-habitat landscapes in Peneda-Gerês National Park, NW Portugal. Taxon: Macro-moths (Lepidoptera). Methods: Light-trapping using a semi-nested design at 84 fixed sites which were each repeatedly sampled six times. Results: Autocovariate models show that sampling sites with a higher number of forest and meadow macro-moth species (alpha diversity) were surrounded by a higher amount of forest and meadow habitat, respectively within a 160 and 320 m radius (scale of effect). These top-ranked models, containing only habitat amount as a significant variable, had lower AIC than models (only) containing patch size and/or isolation. Complementary to this, the countryside species-area relationship (SAR) model outperforms the classic SAR model, so that the effective area of habitat explains landscape species richness (gamma diversity) across spatial scales (beta diversity) better than the classic SAR. Specifically, we show that forest macro-moths have a higher spatial turnover than meadow macro-moths and that, on average, there are more species in forest than in meadow habitat. Main conclusions: The habitat amount hypothesis predicts alpha species richness in multi-habitat landscapes better than do patch size and isolation while the countryside SAR predicts beta and gamma diversity better than the classic SAR.

The lack of a mechanism that explicitly relates population processes to the niche hinders to interpret results and obtain general conclusions.

A clear correlation between abundance and habitat suitability in scenarios without dispersal was found, on the other hand, this correlation decreased as the proportion of individuals who are dispersed increases. These results support the idea  that there is a relationship between habitat suitability and abundances, however, they also show that this relationship is modulated by dispersal.

In this perspective, selective extinction would be the likely cause of nestedness if an area- sorted matrix generates a nested pattern. On the other hand, if a nested pat-tern arises in an isolation- sorted matrix, differential immigration would be a better explanation for the nested structure (Wright et al., 1998).However, a simpler and predominant explanation for a nested pat-tern is based on the ‘passive sampling’ perspective (Connor & McCoy, 1979; Ulrich, Almeida- Neto, & Gotelli, 2009). In this perspective, habitat patches are analogous to ‘passive targets’ that randomly accumulate (or retain) individuals. Larger targets (or larger patches) accumulate more species from the regional pool than do smaller ones simply by chance. Similarly, more abundant species in the regional pool are more likely to occur in any patch than are rare species, also by chance only (Figure 1). Therefore, the passive sampling is an appropriate null perspective for explaining nestedness, especially in systems that cannot meet the as-sumptions of an equilibrium model (Cutler, 1994; MacArthur & Wilson, 1967). This is the case of dynamics or non- equilibrium patch systems (Shepherd & Brantley, 2005).F IGURE  1 Nestedness in assemblage structure.

A hypothetical gradient of favorability decreases from landscapes ‘a’ to ‘d’. More favorable landscapes are expected to contain more species. Favorability in (A) is represented by HA in the landscape. The HA hypothesis predicts that the number of species in a sample site increases with increasing HA in the landscape, even if the size of the patch where the sample site is embedded remains unchanged. We hypothesize that HA also allows to predict an assemblage's species composition because a nested pattern implies changes in species richness. Matrix resistance increases from ‘a’ to ‘d’ in (B). We predict that species richness is inversely related to matrix resistance to biological flow within the landscape if HA is held constant. Therefore, a low- resistance matrix allows the movement of a larger array of species in the landscape, while only stronger dispersers are capable of colonizing a patch surrounded by a highly resistant matrix [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]86  |     RABELO Et AL.Recently, Fahrig (2013) challenged the notion that patch size and isolation per se affect species distribution in patch systems, proposing that a ‘sample area effect’ drives their apparent effects. First, larger patches contain more species than smaller ones simply because they constitute a larger sample area in the landscape. Second, since the hab-itat amount (HA) within a landscape surrounding a focal patch is the primary source of colonists, the focal patch will be more isolated from its source of species as the HA in the landscape decreases. Therefore, the number of species in a focal patch depends on the sampled area represented by the surrounding habitat, which affects its immigration rate (Figure 2A), that is, a larger HA in the landscape will sample a larger portion of the regional species pool. The ‘HA hypothesis’ posits that HA in a local landscape is the main driver of species distribution in patchy systems because it combines the effects of both patch size and isolation into a single predictor. This hypothesis has raised a current debate in landscape ecology for explaining patterns of species richness in patch systems (Haddad et al., 2017; Hanski, 2015; Melo, Sponchiado, Cáceres, & Fahrig, 2017; Rabelo, Bicca- Marques, Aragón, & Nelson, 2017).Matrix type can also affect species richness in habitat patches (Prevedello & Vieira, 2010), although the HA hypothesis posits that it has a secondary role compared to the HA effect (Fahrig, 2013). Matrix type contributes to effective patch isolation because its permeability/resistance may facilitate/compromise biological flow (Metzger & Décamps, 1997). Although the HA hypothesis deals pri-marily with species richness as the response variable, we propose that HA, together with matrix resistance, can also predict species composition of a nested- structured assemblage (Figure 2B). We base our hypothesis on the fact that nestedness necessarily implies that species richness varies across patches.Here, we analyze the pattern and potential drivers of mammal as-semblage composition on river islands in central Amazon. These fluvial islands originate from a complex river dynamics that constantly modi-fies the spatial structure of riverscapes (Peixoto, Nelson, & Wittmann, 2009), which makes them a non- equilibrium patch system (Shepherd & Brantley, 2005). We have previously tested the HA hypothesis in this system and shown that island size only affects the number of species because of the sample area effect (Rabelo et al., 2017). Here, we in-vestigate whether island assemblages show a nested pattern and test whether species’ regional abundances predict their occurrence on islands. We expect that a species' relative abundance in the regional pool determines its local island occurrence (Figure 1), suggesting that the passive sampling null model is a parsimonious explanation for the structure of the species assemblages found on these islands.We also test the HA hypothesis using species composition, not richness, as the response variable. Our aim here was to evaluate whether and how assemblage structure responds to HA and to ma-trix resistance at multiple spatial scales of local landscapes. If these landscape variables are associated with assemblage structure as ex-pected (Figure 2), the HA in the landscape is also a good predictor of species composition on this patch system.2  | MATERIAL AND METHODS2.1 | Study area and study speciesWe sampled islands and the continuous forest near the confluence of the Solimões and Japurá rivers in central Amazon (Figure 3).

Várzea forests are seasonally flooded by nutrient- rich white- water rivers (Prance, 1979). The aver-age annual range of the water level is 12 m (Ramalho et al., 2009), reaching its maximum level around June and its minimum between October and November (IDSM 2010).River dynamics constantly modifies the spatial structure of these riverscapes (Peixoto et al., 2009; Puhakka, Kalliola, Rajasilta, & Salo, 1992), creating fluvial islands by the erosion, transport, and deposition of sediments (Kalliola, Salo, Puhakka, & Rajasilta, 1991). Here, we consider the fluvial islands within these river-scapes as our model of habitat patches. River dynamics affects species distribution in terrestrial environments (Toivonen, Maki, & Kalliola, 2007) and can facilitate dispersal and influence species’ occurrence on fluvial islands (e.g., birds: Cintra, Sanaiotti, & Cohn- Haft, 2007; and primates: Rabelo et al., 2014). Although fluvial is-lands can be considered ephemeral patches for species with long generation times (Shepherd & Brantley, 2005), we consider them appropriate patch models to test the HA hypothesis. We restricted our sample to islands that have lasted long enough to sustain two or more generations of the species of our study group to minimize the influence of ephemeral islands on the results (see ‘Sampling design’ section, below).The mammals inhabiting várzea forests are mostly arbo-real (primates and sloths). However, scansorial (anteaters and squirrels) and terrestrial (coatis and jaguars) species can also be present. Long- term studies within the Mamirauá Reserve have shown that even jaguars reside and remain in the flooded forest during the high- water season (E. E. Ramalho, unpublished data). The arboreal mammals rarely descend to the ground, but can occasionally move through shrubby and herbaceous vegetation, walk on sandy substrates, or even swim in rivers and lakes. The terrestrial species also spend most of their time in the canopy, especially during flooding. Therefore, we only consider those environments that fulfill all requirements to constitute ‘habitat’ for our mammal assemblage as structured forests (Fahrig, 2013). Várzea forest mammals are good study models because they often reach high population densities (Peres, 1997), thereby increasing survey detection rate and reducing the risk of false negatives.2.2 | Sampling designWe adopted a mixed patch- landscape scale sampling design. In this approach, each landscape represents a sample unit. The response variable is measured within a focal patch (the island), whereas the predictor variable can be measured both at the patch and at the surrounding local landscape within a given distance from the focal patch (McGarigal & Cushman, 2002). An alternative adaptation of the patch- landscape design assesses the response variable not in the patches, but in equal- sized sample sites with landscape- scale pre-dictors measured within a specific radius from them (Fahrig, 2013; Figure 2).We sampled 14 focal islands (Supporting information Table S1) and adopted a multi- scale approach to find the appropriate scale to detect the predictor's effects on our study group, the scale of effect (Martin & Fahrig, 2012). We used 12 buffer distances (500–6,000 m, at 500- m intervals) from the sample sites of each island to define that sample's local landscape for each scale (Figure 3). We chose the islands based on the following criteria: (a) surrounded by water, even during the low- water season; (b) minimum distance between islands’ edges of 2 km to avoid overlapping landscapes (only 2 out of 14 landscapes overlapped at the buffer scales of 3,000–6,000 m); and (c) minimum age of 30 years (determined using a historical series of Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite images) to avoid islands that are too ephemeral for our study group (e.g., jaguar generation time ~7 years, de la Torre, González- Maya, Zarza, Ceballos, & Medellín, 2018). We removed newly formed islands younger than 30 years be-cause this period is insufficient for the development of a forest with an adequate structure to harbor arboreal mammals. Islands under this age are dominated by pioneer vegetation and rarely hold late- succession forest patches (Peixoto et al., 2009; Wittmann, Junk, & Piedade, 2004).2.3 | Data collectionMammal sampling was conducted along a single linear transect on each island (Figure 3). Transect length varied from 1.2 to 11.6 km and it was directly correlated to island size (Pearson correlation: r = 0.94, p < 0.001), making patch size an intrinsic characteristic of each sample. We also surveyed mammals at nine independent sam-ple sites distributed in the adjacent continuous floodplain forest (black squares in Figure 3) to estimate the relative regional abun-dance of species in the source pool. Surveys consisted of quiet walks on trails by two trained observers at ca. 1.5 km/hr following a stand-ardized protocol (Peres, 1999). We carried out the surveys in the morning (06:30–11:30 hr) and afternoon (14:00–17:00 hr), interrupt-ing them during rains. We recorded species via sighting and vestiges, such as calls and feces. We also recorded the occurrence of jaguars and semi- arboreal species via footprints and fresh signs of digging. We conducted four surveys per transect, separated by no more than 4 days, during the low- water season (September to November) of either 2013 or 2014. We limited surveys to the low- water season to minimize potential seasonal effects on species detection. We were unable to visit all islands during a single low- water season due to logistical constraints.We used a Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) scene from 24 October 2014 (low- water season) to extract the landscape cover types and their spatial configurations. As the water level drops, areas of sand, and herbaceous and shrub vegetation emerge, nar-rowing the width of rivers and adding heterogeneity to the matrix surrounding islands. All GIS processing was undertaken using QGIS software version 2.8.1 (QGIS Development Team 2015). We used three of the OLI spectral bands (near infrared, red, and green) at a 30- m spatial resolution to perform a semi- supervised classification using the Semi- Automatic Classification Plugin available in QGIS. We 88  |     RABELO Et AL.obtained 8 to 15 training areas for each of five pre- defined cover classes (forest, shrub, herbaceous, sand, and water) via visual inter-pretation of a false- color composite of the same three bands. We found an accuracy between 94.8% and 97.1% in the validation of our classifications. Forest was defined as habitat, whereas the other four classes were treated as matrix types. We used the classified raster image to calculate the area of habitat within each local landscape at each buffer scale, that is, the habitat amount (HA) metric.We obtained a metric of matrix resistance (MR) for each sur-rounding landscape at each buffer scale. This metric considered the distance to habitat, the resistance of each matrix type to animal movement, and the matrix area in the local landscape (Metzger & Décamps, 1997), as follows:where IEi = Ii * Ri represents the effective isolation of pixel ‘i’; Ii is the linear distance from pixel ‘i’ to the nearest pixel of habitat; Ri is the resistance coefficient to biological flow of the matrix type present in pixel ‘i’; and AM is the number of matrix pixels within the landscape.Resistance coefficients (Ri) are necessary because of the scar-city of studies on animal movement (Zeller, McGarigal, & Whiteley, 2012). In the absence of data to estimate resistance values, we con-sulted expert researchers. We sent a closed format questionnaire (Appendix S1) to 50 mammal specialists, asking them to assign a re-sistance weight from 0 to 10 to each matrix type for each species individually and for the overall group of species. A ‘0’ resistance indi-cates a fully permeable environment similar to the forested habitat, whereas a ‘10’ value qualifies a matrix type as highly resistant to bi-ological flow comparable to an impermeable barrier to animal move-ment. We received responses from 29 experts (=58% response rate). Specialists tended to assign an increasing resistance from shrub to herbaceous vegetation, then to sand and, finally, water (Supporting information Figure S3). We took the median of all scores of each matrix type as its resistance coefficient (Ri) because the response distribution was asymmetric. We estimated habitat amount and ma-trix resistance for each spatial scale of the local landscapes. These metrics were calculated using the ‘raster’ 2.2–31 (Hijmans, 2014) and ‘sp’ (Bivand, Pebesma, & Gomez- Rubio, 2013) packages in R 3.1.3 software (R Development Core Team 2015).2.4 | Data analysisWe constructed a matrix of species abundance by site: a table of species (columns) versus sites (rows) containing the raw counts of each species on each island. We excluded two islands from the ma-trix because they harbored no mammal. We estimated the degree of nestedness of mammal assemblages across the remaining 12 is-lands using metrics based on overlap and decreasing fill with both presence–absence (NODF) and abundance data (WNODF; Almeida- Neto & Ulrich, 2011). We determined the significance of nestedness using a null model that changes matrix structure while maintaining column and row marginal totals (i.e., the fixed- fixed [FF] algorithm) to simulate 1,000 random matrices, following the recommended ap-prouach of Ulrich et al. (2009). We performed this analysis using the NODF Program (Almeida- Neto & Ulrich, 2011). We also separated the nestedness component from the turnover component to evalu-ate their independent contributions to the total variation of species composition in the assemblage (i.e., beta- diversity) as proposed by Baselga (2010). This analysis was performed using the ‘betapart’ R package (Baselga, Orme, Villeger, Bortoli, & Leprieur, 2018).We also assessed the change in species composition across the study islands via a non- metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) or-dination of the species- site matrix. Prior to performing the matrix or-dination, we controlled for the sample area effect as our islands had different sampling efforts according to island size. We accomplished this task by dividing the abundance of species in each matrix cell by the total abundance in the matrix row (site). We performed this stan-dardization of samples to equal totals (SAT) to reduce the discrepancy between sites with different sampling efforts (i.e., the sample area effect). We also applied SAT to matrix columns (species) to minimize the difference between abundant and rare species. Standardization of the species- site matrices prior to ordination procedures helps to identify the strongest intrinsic pattern of assemblage structure, and SAT has been recognized as a robust standardization method for ecological ordinations (Faith, Minchin, & Belbin, 1987). We then per-formed a two- axis NMDS ordination based on the Bray–Curtis pair-wise dissimilarities between sample sites, reducing the assemblage structure pattern to two axes (McCune & Grace, 2002).We fitted a simple regression model to test whether the rela-tive regional abundance of a species's predicts its respective oc-currence on islands. We used the species scores derived from the NMDS ordination as the response variable to fit this model. These species’ scores correspond to the order of species in the ordered species- site matrix, that is, they represent the species relative inci-dence on islands according to the NMDS ordination. We also con-structed a species- site matrix with the continuous forest sample sites, then applied the same standardization procedure with the SAT method, and used the sum of the relative abundances of spe-cies in all sample sites to represent the relative regional abundance of each species.We used each site's score on the first NMDS axis to represent its mammal assemblage composition. To evaluate how species composition responds to habitat amount and matrix resistance, we initially found the scale at which each predictor best predicts the re-sponse variable, namely the scale of effect (Martin & Fahrig, 2012). Therefore, we used an AIC model selection approach to choose the best scale of effect for each predictor variable (habitat amount and matrix resistance), as predictors may have different scales of effect (see Appendix S3). After having found the scale of effect for each landscape predictor, we used another model selection procedure to evaluate how landscape predictors affect species composition, ac-cording to four candidate models with the following predictors: null, HA only, MR only, and HA + MR. We also included island size as a predictor in candidate models to evaluate whether it affects species composition (see Appendix S3). We performed these analyses using MR=∑AMi=1IEiAM     |  89RABELO Et AL.the vegan 2.2- 1 (Oksanen et al., 2013) package, inside R 3.1.3 statis-tical software (R Development Core Team 2015).3  | RESULTSWe found seven mammal species (Supporting information Table S2) belonging to the orders Primates (2), Pilosa (2), Carnivora (2), and Rodentia (1). The first NMDS axis explained 50% of the variation in species composition among sample sites (Figure 4A).The nestedness of both the occurrence and the abundance- based matrices did not differ significantly from null assem-blages (NODFOBS = 74.39; NODFEXP = 71.83; p = 0.42; and WNODFOBS = 53.27; WNODFEXP = 48.94; p = 0.30). Accordingly, the relative regional abundance of a species predicted its incidence on islands (F1,5 = 16.29; R² = 0.77; p < 0.01, Figure 4B). The higher the regional abundance of a species, the higher its frequency of island occupancy (Figure 4B). We found that both turnover and nestedness components contributed similarly to the overall beta- diversity (βOVERALL) of the islands’ mammal assemblages (βTURN-OVER = 0.38; βNESTEDNESS = 0.34; βOVERALL = 0.72).Habitat amount in the landscape and matrix resistance affected species composition at different scales of effect (HA at 3,000 m: slope = 1.32, p < 0.001; MR at 500 m: slope = −0.25, p = 0.02; supporting information Figure S4). However, the best explanatory model only included HA, which successfully predicted the mam-mal species composition of our study fluvial islands (F1,10 = 26.11; R² = 0.72; p < 0.001; Figure 4C; Table 1). Island size and matrix re-sistance had significant effects on species composition only when analyzed alone, that is, they did not affect species composition after controlling for the effect of HA in the landscape (Supporting infor-mation Table S7).4  | DISCUSSION4.1 | ‘Equilibrium’ versus ‘Passive sampling’ perspectivesWe did not detect a significant nested pattern in the assemblage structure. The observed NODF and WNODF values, which did not differ from expected null model values, imply a random structure of mammal assemblage in these fluvial islands. Additionally, the F IGURE  4 Structure of the mammal assemblage of central Amazon River islands. (A) Islands sorted by the NMDS 1 axis according to the NMDS ordination.

Therefore, the species’ abundance in the regional pool best explains the structuring of our study is-land assemblages via the underlying process of passive sampling. Our results are compatible with meta- analyses showing that, when conservative null models are used, significant nestedness is consid-erably less common than previously reported (Matthews, Cottee- Jones, & Whittaker, 2015; Ulrich et al., 2009).We found that the overall beta- diversity pattern of our mam-mal assemblage in Amazonian fluvial islands may be similarly par-titioned into turnover and nestedness components. This means that two processes can equally generate the assemblages’ beta- diversity: species replacement from the turnover component, and species loss from the nestedness component (Baselga, 2010). This finding corroborates the nestedness analysis performed with NODF and WNODF metrics in which we did not find a significant nested structure as expected by chance. However, as stated by Baselga (2010), we highlight that nestedness and dissimilarity due to nestedness are related but different concepts. The βNESTEDNESS index is a metric rooted in the framework of beta- diversity analy-ses, and it is not a measure of nestedness in absolute terms unlike the NODF and WNODF metrics. Instead, βNESTEDNESS is an index of dissimilarity used to account for the patterns of beta- diversity caused by nestedness.Under the equilibrium perspective, extinction–colonization dy-namics manly drives species richness and composition in habitat patches (MacArthur & Wilson, 1967). Selective extinction occurs at a rate inversely proportional to patch size especially in land- bridge systems where a species occupies habitat patches prior to their isolation (Leibold & Mikkelson, 2002). On the other hand, nested patterns caused by differential immigration resulting from dispersal limitation are expected to occur in systems composed by previously vacant patches at the time of their creation (Cook & Quinn, 1995).Fluvial islands contain particular habitat conditions that affect the occurrence of species. They originate from (a) the deposition of sediments as sandbars in the river channel that are followed by pri-mary succession (Kalliola et al., 1991; Puhakka et al., 1992) or (b) the erosion of river meanders, pinching off a peninsula of continuous floodplain forest (Peixoto et al., 2009; Puhakka et al., 1992). Given that both processes can play a role in the emergence of our study islands, we cannot rule out the possibility that these islands have different long- term abiotic and biotic histories, beyond the 30- year time window available from satellite images. Therefore, we cannot reject the potential effects of these historical processes in creating the observed non- significant nested structure of our study mammal assemblages under the equilibrium perspective.4.2 | Habitat amount hypothesisHA in the landscape predicted the mammal assemblage structure of our study islands particularly at the 3,000- m scale. Both the HA hy-pothesis and the passive sampling explanation for nestedness argue that the sample area effect explains the patch size effect: Larger habitat patches ‘sample’ more species from the regional pool than do smaller habitat patches (Connor & McCoy, 1979; Fahrig, 2013). The passive sampling model further predicts the species composi-tion by considering that the abundance of a species in the regional pool  affects its probability of occurrence in a given patch.We have previously shown that the size of these fluvial islands has a direct influence on their species richness simply as a conse-quence of the sample area effect (Rabelo et al., 2017); that is, HA in the surrounding landscape, instead of island size, explains the number of species sighted in transects of equal length. Here, we show that island size also does not affect species composition at sample sites after controlling for the effect of HA in the landscape (Supporting information Table S7). Therefore, we combined sample area effect and the perspective of passive sampling to show that HA in the landscape also drives the structuring of the mammal assem-blage of these islands. That is, landscapes containing higher amounts of habitat sample more species than those with less habitat, and more abundant species are more likely to be ‘sampled’.The relationship between area and species richness or composi-tion under the passive sampling viewpoint is solely a sampling phe-nomenon, rather than the outcome of biological processes, such as extinction or immigration (Connor & McCoy, 1979). This is the rea-son why the passive sampling is a null hypothesis. However, we argue that this simplification requires caution because a species’ common-ness or rarity in a given region likely relates to its biology and ecology. Therefore, the role of ecological traits, such as species abundance, should also be acknowledged. On the other hand, the HA hypothesis does not deny that extinction and colonization can drive species rich-ness in habitat patches (Fahrig, 2013). Instead, it states that there is TABLE  1 Ranking of explanatory models of the mammal species composition of Amazonian fluvial islands. NMDS 1 is the site scores from an NMDS ordination and represents the species composition of each island.

The latter hypothesis further implies that the effects of patch size and isolation are redundant because they are components of HA in the landscape, whose influence on species richness takes place mainly via the sample area effect.4.3 | Matrix resistanceWe only found a significant response of species composition to matrix resistance at the 500- m spatial scale when the model only included this predictor, although this model was not chosen as a plausible explanatory one in the selection procedure (Table 1). The lack of association between matrix resistance and assemblage struc-ture can result from the fact that we measured the former during the low- water season of 2014. As the water level can vary up to 12 m (Ramalho et al., 2009) between the low- and high- water sea-sons, matrix resistance also varies from higher values during the high- water season to lower values in the dry season. This seasonal pattern means that mammals can colonize islands more easily in October than in June. Additionally, the ability to move through the matrix is species- specific (Prevedello & Vieira, 2010). That is, assem-blage components do not respond uniformly to matrix resistance if their vagilities differ. Therefore, when matrix type affects a patch's species richness, its effects are often weaker than those of HA. Consequently, analyzing the effects of matrix on individual species is a stronger approach.5  | CONCLUSIONSPassive sampling explains the structuring of the mammal assem-blages of central Amazon River islands: (a) Larger islands contain more species simply because they are larger ‘targets’ and, consequently, sample more species from the regional pool; and (b) the species com-position of islands reflects the species’ abundances in the regional pool because common species are more likely to occur in any given island than rare ones. Despite the discussion on whether extinction or colonization generates nestedness, habitat amount in the surrounding landscape stood out as an effective and straightforward predictor of species composition of fluvial islands. The identification of single and easy- to- measure variables is critical in the current context of press-ing conservation challenges (Fahrig, 2013). We suggest that habitat amount can also be useful for predicting species composition and species richness in other patchy systems. Finally, we conclude that the passive sampling hypothesis is more appropriate than an island biogeography perspective for explaining the patterns of mammal as-semblage structure in our study fluvial islands.ACKNOWLEDG EMENTSThis research was funded by the Instituto de Desenvolvimento Sustentável Mamirauá (IDSM- OS/MCTI).

In the past, papers presenting single SAR curves prevailed. Recently, also unifying works have appeared. One approach has focused on the possible relationship between mean number of individuals per species and the rate of increase of number of species with area. According to this theory higher mean species abundance leads to lower values of SAR curve slope. Moreover, there is one prediction based on maximization of entropy principle (MaxEnt) that is able to give us particular values of SAR's slope when we provide the values of mean species abundance. There are also other approaches except for MaxEnt one that deals with mean species abundance and reached similar results. The main aim of this work was to gather all possible data about slopes of SARs and mean species abundances and find out possible relationships between these two variables.

However, the TIB remains silent about functional trait composition and provides no information on the scaling of functional diversity with area, an observation that is now documented in many systems. To fill this gap, we develop a probabilistic approach to predict the distribution of a trait as a function of habitat area and isolation, extending the TIB beyond the traditional species-area relationship. We compare model predictions to the body-size distribution of piscivorous and herbivorous fishes found on tropical reefs worldwide. We find that small and isolated reefs have a higher proportion of large-sized species than large and connected reefs. We also find that knowledge of species body-size and trophic position improves the predictions of fish occupancy on tropical reefs, supporting both the allometric and trophic theory of island biogeography. The integration of functional ecology to island biogeography is broadly applicable to any functional traits and provides a general probabilistic approach to study the scaling of trait distribution with habitat area and isolation",,"Article, PeerReviewed",,,Wiley-Blackwell

Animal space use should therefore vary according to habitat characteristics, a process known as the """"functional response"""" in habitat selection. This response has often been tested vis-à-vis the proportion of a habitat category within areas available to individuals. Measuring sought-after resources in landscape where they are continuously distributed is a challenge and we posit here that both the mean availability of a resource and its spatial variation should be measured. Accordingly, we tested for a functional response in habitat selection according to these two descriptors of the resource available for a mountain herbivore. We hypothesized that selection should decrease with mean value of resources available and increase with its spatial variation. Based on GPS data from 50 chamois females and data on the actual foodscape (i.e., distribution of edible-only biomass in the landscape), we estimated individual selection ratio (during summer months) for biomass at the home range level, comparing edible biomass in individual home ranges and the mean and standard deviation of edible biomass in their available range. Chamois being a group-living species, available accessible ranges were shared by several individuals that formed socio-spatial groups (clusters) in the population. As expected, selection ratios increased with the standard deviation of edible resources in each cluster, but unlike our prediction, was unrelated to its mean. Selection of areas richer in resources hence did not fade away when more resources were available on average, a result that may be explained by the need for this capital breeder species to accumulate fat-reserve at a high rate during summer months.

Conversely, even though ecological models and experiments have demonstrated the importance of spatial heterogeneity for the rate of population change, we still have no practical method for making the connection between the makeup of real environments, the expected distribution and fitness of their occupants, and the long-term implications of fitness for population growth. Here, we synthesize several conceptual advances into a mathematical framework using a measure of fitness to link habitat availability/selection to (density-dependent) population growth in mobile animal species. A key feature of this approach is that it distinguishes between apparent habitat suitability and the true, underlying contribution of a habitat to fitness, allowing the statistical coefficients of both to be estimated from multiple observation instances of the species in different environments and stages of numerical growth. Hence, it leverages data from both historical population time series and snapshots of species distribution to predict population performance under environmental change. We propose this framework as a foundation for building more realistic connections between a population's use of space and its subsequent dynamics (and hence a contribution to the ongoing efforts to estimate a species' critical habitat and fundamental niche). We therefore detail its associated definitions and simplifying assumptions, because they point to the framework's future extensions. We show how the model can be fit to data on species distributions and population dynamics, using standard statistical methods, and we illustrate its application with an individual-based simulation. When contrasted with nonspatial population models, our approach is better at fitting and predicting population growth rates and carrying capacities. Our approach can be generalized to include a diverse range of biological considerations.

In this study, we examined the effect of spatial configuration of habitat capacity on different metrics of β diversity, i.e., β diversity measured as turnover and as variation. For β diversity as turnover, a monotonic species spatial turnover pattern is typically considered as a benchmark for species distributions driven only by dispersal process. Deviations from a monotonic curve are attributed to local environmental filtering (i.e., the same environmental factors affecting different species differently). However, we found non-monotonicity in species spatial turnover in models without environmental filtering effect. This non-monotonicity was caused by variation in α diversity, introduced by spatial configuration of habitat capacity. After applying a recent null-model approach—designed to tease out the effect of variation in α diversity—species spatial turnover remained non-monotonic. This non-monotonicity makes it problematic to use species spatial turnover to infer the underlying processes for species distribution, i.e., whether it is driven by environmental filtering or dispersal processes. Spatial configuration of habitat capacity also influences landscape connectivity. Small-habitat capacity sites may constrain movements of organisms (i.e., dispersal) between sites supporting high capacity habitats. We showed that in a landscape where small-habitat capacity sites were located in positions important for dispersal (e.g., in the center as opposed to on the edge of a landscape) has a higher spatial variation of species composition, hence, higher β diversity. Ecologists who use different measures of β diversity should be aware of these effects introduced by spatial configuration of habitat capacity",,Article,"beta diversity, habitat capacity, landscape connectivity, monotonicity, similarity indices, spatial configuration, species spatial turnover",,Ecological Society of America

Species-area relationships (SARs), measuring how the number of observed species increases upon enlarging the sampled area, constitute a convenient tool for quantifying the spatial structure of biodiversity. While general features of species-area curves are quite universal across ecosystems, some quantitative aspects can change significantly. Several attempts have been made to link these variations to ecological forces. Within the framework of spatially explicit neutral models, here we scrutinize the effect of varying the local population size (i.e. the number of individuals per site) and the level of habitat saturation (allowing for empty sites). We conclude that species-area curves become shallower when the local population size increases, while habitat saturation, unless strongly violated, plays a marginal role.

Assuming that (i) available space restricts predator body size, (ii) mass-specific energy needs of predators scale with their body size, and (iii) energy availability scales with prey biomass, wepredicted that predator biomass per unit area would scale with habitat size (quarter-power exponent) and preybiomass (three-quarter–power exponent). We found that total predator biomass scaled with habitat size and preyresources as expected across 29 New Zealand rivers, such that a unit of habitat in a small ecosystem supported lesspredator biomass than anequivalent unit in a large ecosystem. The lower energetic costs of largebody size likelymeanthat a unit of prey resource supports more biomass of large-bodied predators compared to small-bodied predators.Thus, contracting habitat size reduces the predator mass that can be supported because of constraints on predatorbody size, and this may be a powerful mechanism exacerbating reductions in biodiversity due to habitat loss.INTRODUCTIONHabitat reduction is a key cause of biodiversity loss, but managing risksposed by ongoing habitat contraction and fragmentation is hindered bylimited understanding of the effects on foodwebs (1, 2). Habitat size hasmany important influences (3, 4), but knowledge of themechanistic dri-vers linking habitat size with characteristics of trophic structure, such asthe capacity to support predators, is still surprisingly limited (1, 5).The influence of habitat size on trophic structure via constraints onthe body size of predators could be critically important in managingproblems associated with contracting habitat size—the sizes of habitatsrequired to support predator populations—and in understanding keyfeatures of the trophic structure of foodwebs.Many biological attributesscale with body size (6), but the dependence of both foraging area re-quirements andmass-specificmetabolic rates on body size likely createsa habitat-size dependence, which is fundamentally important for thetrophic structure of food webs. Body size is closely connected to habitatsize because larger organisms usually require more space (7, 8). For ex-ample, home-range size typically has a power-scaling relationship withbody size (9, 10).Moreover, because top predators tend to be among thelargest organisms present, particularly in aquatic ecosystems (11), hab-itat size likely constrains the individual mass of organisms at highertrophic levels.The capacity of food webs to support predators, as highlighted byElton (12), also depends on the availability of energy at lower trophiclevels and the loss of energy through metabolic processes (7, 11, 13).This connection between metabolism and trophic efficiency providesthe second important link between habitat size and the body size of pre-dators. Because metabolic rates generally have three-quarter–powerscaling with body size (14), habitat size–related influences on predatorbody size will affect the metabolism and trophic efficiency of organismsat the top of food webs. Essentially, larger predators, because of thethree-quarter–power scaling of metabolism with body size, are likelyto be more efficient in their mass-specific use of energy compared tosmaller predators.On the basis of this dual dependence of both foraging area require-ments andmass-specific metabolic rates on body size and using scalingrelationships between prey biomass and productivity (15), we develop asimple theory predicting the shape of the relationship between habitatsize and the capacity of an ecosystem to support predator biomass.Combining scaling of metabolic processes with body size, scaling ofbody size with habitat size, and scaling of prey productivity with preybiomass (described in the “Theoretical predictions” section), we predictthat the total predator biomass per unit area should have a power-scaling relationship with habitat size with an exponent of 0.25 and apower-scaling relationship with prey biomass with an exponent of0.75.We assessed empirical evidence for the predictions from the theoryusingmeasurements of prey biomass and predator biomass from 29 rel-atively unmodified grassland rivers in New Zealand spanning threeorders of magnitude in habitat size.RESULTSTheoretical predictionsOur predictions are based on the general allometric scaling relation-ships, which have emerged from the metabolic theory of ecology (14),combined with the trophic control of food webs popularized by Elton(11) and recently expanded by Hatton et al. (15). Initially, we focus onthe predator trophic level and connect the scaling relationships of bodysize with both habitat size and individual metabolism. The first of theseconnections is based on the inverse of the usual metabolic theory pre-diction of home-range allometry (that is, where body size is regarded asthe dependent, not the independent, variable). Thus, body size of pre-dators (M) is expected to scale with habitat size (H) according to anexponent b = 1M ¼ a1H1 ð1Þwhere M is individual mass, H is habitat size, and a1 is a constant ofproportionality. This relationship is well supported across many typesof organisms (9, 10, 14), including those that live in rivers (16, 17).Second, whole-organismmetabolism scales with individualmasswitha power exponent of three-quarters (14). This leads to the within-trophic1 of 7SC I ENCE ADVANCES | R E S EARCH ART I C L Elevel (that is, for predators) expected scaling between individual biomass(M) and abundance per unit area of habitat (N) (14)N ¼ a2M0:75 ð2ÞThe total standing biomass per unit area (B) is related to the abun-dance per unit area (N) and mean body mass (M) viaB ¼ MN ð3ÞA habitat size–based expectation for predator biomass per unit area(Bpred) is derived by substitution from the above and ignoring organism-specific constants. Thus, we getBpred ¼ ða1HÞa2ða1HÞ0:75 ¼ cH0:25 ð4Þwhere c = a10.25 a2. These predictions only relate to the trophic levelwhose body size we expect to be limited by the habitat size, that is, pre-dators. Yet, the collective biomass of predators in a habitat is also limitedby the availability of energy at lower trophic levels, likely making Eq. 4alone aweak predictor of predator biomass. Thus, prey availabilitymustbe incorporated to derive a scaling relationship that reliably predicts ahabitat’s capacity to support predators. Incorporating prey availabil-ity into this equation is straightforward if one focuses on the trophiclevel immediately below, measured here as the standing stockbiomass of primary consumers. This also yields a theory capable ofpredicting an important aspect of food web structure, that is, foodweb shape or predator/prey biomass ratios. If primary consumerproductivity per unit area (Pprey) reflects energy available to predators,then the value of c in Eq. 4 should be proportional to Pprey, whichscales with prey biomass to the power of 0.75 (15). Incorporating thisscaling into our equation (that is, replacing c by c0Bprey0.75 in Eq. 4)givesBpred ¼ c0H0:25B 0:75prey ð5ÞThis predicts that predator biomass per unit area should have quarter-and three-quarter–power scaling relationships with habitat size andprey biomass, respectively. This relationship should have far-reachingconsequences because it links both habitat size and prey availabilitywithtrophic structure.Empirical resultsWe measured predators, including their body size and standing stockbiomass, and the standing stock biomass of primary consumers in riversspanning three orders of magnitude in habitat size measured by dis-charge. The size of predators was positively related to habitat size inour study rivers, having a power-scaling relationship very close to thatexpected in Eq. 1 {individual fish mass accounting for 50% of thecumulative biomass “P50” [in grams of dry mass (DM)] = 46.26H1.04,R2 = 0.50, F1,22 = 22.32, P < 0.001; 95% confidence interval (CI) forscaling exponent, 0.58 to 1.50; Fig. 1A}. In situationswhere downstreamdispersal barriers (for example, waterfalls) prevented fish access and toppredators were invertebrates, predator sizes were substantially smallerthan those of fish (Fig. 1A). Available prey biomass was not related toP50 (R2 = 0.08, F1,25 = 2.07, P = 0.16; Fig. 1B).McIntosh et al., Sci. Adv. 2018;4 : eaap7523 4 July 2018The availability of prey at each river, measured by the biomass perunit area of primary consumers, was variable and unrelated to habitatsize (R2 < 0.01, F1,27 = 0.14, P = 0.72; Fig 1C). Using a subsample of15 rivers for which auxiliary data were available, further drivers ofinvertebrate secondary production, includingmean annual temperatureandmean individual primary consumer bodymass, were also shown tobe unrelated to habitat size (R2 = 0.13 andP=0.18 andR2 = 0.05 andP=0.41, respectively; fig. S1).We observed an increase in the collective biomass per unit area ofpredators (Bpred), with habitat size (H) having a power-scaling rela-tionship consistent with the 0.25 exponent predicted by Eq. 4 [Bpred(in grams of DM per square meter) = 1.98H0.23, F1,27 = 5.46, P =0.027; exponent 95% CI, 0.027 to 0.42; Fig. 1D]. However, as expected,given the variability in energy availability to the base of the food web,the relationship was relatively weak (R2 = 0.17). Predator biomassper unit area was positively related to prey biomass per unit area witha scaling exponent of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.41 to 1.16), close to the expected0.75 and with a reasonably strong relationship (R2 = 0.41, F1,27 =18.97, P < 0.001; Fig. 1E).When the observed three-quarter–power scaling of prey biomassper unit area was incorporated with quarter-power scaling of habitatsize (Eq. 5), we observed stronger scaling patterns with predatorbiomass per unit area (Bpred = 0.92H0.25 Bprey0.83; model R2 = 0.62;F2,26 = 21.32; P < 0.001). Moreover, the scaling exponents for habitatsize and prey biomass per unit area (0.25 and 0.83, respectively) wereclose to those expected (exponent 95%CIs, 0.12 to 0.39 and 0.52 to 1.13for habitat size and prey biomass, respectively). Adjusted regressionplots and partial regression coefficients also illustrated the strong andindependent positive effects of both habitat size (partial R2 = 0.36)and prey biomass per unit area (partial R2 = 0.54) on predator biomassper unit area (Fig. 1, F and G). Akaike information criterion correctedfor small sample size (AICc) scores indicated that the two-parametermodel incorporating both habitat-size scaling and prey biomass per unitarea scaling (AICc = 1.04) for predicting predator biomass was muchbetter than single-parameter models with either habitat size (AICc =21.14) or prey biomass per unit area (AICc = 11.05). Overall, these non-linear relationships indicate that the amount of predator biomass thatcan be supported by a given unit of habitat in a river scales with both theavailable prey biomass and the habitat size of the river, as predicted byEq. 5. Consequently, a unit of habitat in a small ecosystem supportedless predator biomass than an equivalent unit of habitat in a large eco-system with the same amount of prey biomass (Fig. 2).DISCUSSIONHabitat loss and fragmentation are some of themost pervasive causes ofbiodiversity loss especially among top predators (18, 19), thereby alsocompromising important ecosystem functions (2). The theory and em-pirical patterns that we describe, relating the size of habitats to their ca-pacity to support predator biomass, provide important insights into theprocesses underlying these issues because they connect habitat size withtrophic structure and add to our understanding of why habitat loss issuch a pernicious cause of biodiversity loss. Given concordance betweentheory and observation in our study streams, the scaling of predatorbiomass with habitat size is likely to be a product of the laws of energytransformation embodied within metabolic scaling theory combinedwith the spatial constraints of habitat size on the body size of predators.Because larger organisms have, on average, slower metabolic rates (14),a unit of prey biomass can support a greater biomass of large-bodied2 of 7SC I ENCE ADVANCES | R E S EARCH ART I C L EFig. 1.

The data for (F) and (G) were generated using the equation Bpred =0.92H0.25 Bprey0.83, where Bpred is predator biomass per unit area, H is habitat size, and Bprey is primary consumer biomass per unit area. P50 predator mass was un-available for two fishless rivers where predatory invertebrates were group-weighed.McIntosh et al., Sci. Adv. 2018;4 : eaap7523 4 July 2018 3 of 7SC I ENCE ADVANCES | R E S EARCH ART I C L Epredators compared to small-bodied predators. Thus, because largerhabitats enable larger predators to persist (5, 9, 10, 20), all else beingequal, the total predator biomass supported in those habitats shouldbe greater.Moreover, because the allometry of foraging area requirementsandmass-specificmetabolic rates are well defined bymetabolic theory,it was possible to derive a general theory following quarter-powerscaling predicting the specific shape of these relationships. Essentially,this means that the effects of habitat size reduction on biodiversity lossare made worse because of reduced capacity to support predator popu-lations. Thus, our findings indicate that predators are disproportionatelyvulnerable to habitat-size reductions or constraints, with associatedfar-reaching implications for management of both large predators andhabitat loss.Implications for trophic structureThe habitat size-related influences on body size and the associated linkswith metabolic theory that we describe offer important insights into thecontrol of food web trophic structure. First, a biomass pyramid wherestanding predator biomass is nearly as high as standing prey biomass, oreven higher as in inverted biomass pyramids, is possible through a rangeof mechanisms (13). However, we show that these top-heavy trophicstructures only occurred in large habitats. In those large habitats, thelower mass-specific metabolic costs associated with the larger size ofthe predators likely make the use of prey resources more efficient(Fig. 2). This outcome did not occur because larger habitats were moreproductive; none of the main drivers of primary consumer productivity(that is, abundance, nutrients, temperature, and body size) covariedwithstream size (Fig. 1C and figs. S1 and S2). Thus, along with other me-chanisms (13), habitat size likely plays an important role in determiningprecisely how top-heavy food webs can be within ecosystems.Second, our findings also point to a mechanism that may be impor-tant in controlling the length of food chains. Combinations of threemain mechanisms for controlling food chain length have typically beenconsidered—(i) restrictions on energy supply, (ii) the size of ecosystems,and (iii) disturbances that affect the reliability of food supplies to uppertrophic levels (21)—but the mechanism that might underpin any eco-system size effect has been less clear (22). By accommodating largerMcIntosh et al., Sci. Adv. 2018;4 : eaap7523 4 July 2018predator body sizes, which are more energetically efficient, larger eco-systems may also allow more energy to be passed upward, therebylengthening food chains. Thus, the combination of large predator bodysize, made possible by large habitat size, coupled with the metabolic ad-vantages of large body size, could play a substantial role in the length-ening of food chains in large habitats.Finally, because predators are key drivers of community structureand function (2, 23), effects of habitat-size alterations on important eco-system functions could also be widespread and far-reaching. Dis-proportionate effects of habitat modification on predators (2, 18, 19),and theoretical and empirical work highlighting the spatial control oftrophic interactions (24), also point to there being strong links betweenhabitat size and food web structure. Our findings add to the weight ofevidence suggesting that contractions in habitat size could destabilizepredator-prey relationships and are also consistent with theory and ob-servations suggesting that community stability decreases with habitatsize (4, 23, 25).Implications for the management of riversGiven our expectation that capacity to support predator biomass willdecline if habitat size is reduced, and will thus exacerbate the effectsof habitat loss, it is not surprising that human-driven reduction of riverflows has coincided with high rates of aquatic biodiversity loss and del-eterious effects on aquatic biota, leading to a global crisis (26). Likewise,severe reductions in habitat size associated with drying in aquatic eco-systems have the most marked effects on large organisms at highertrophic levels (25, 27) and can be associated with thresholds that affectpopulation persistence (28). Moreover, the nonlinear nature of the re-lationships that we describe also means that there are problems withthose approaches, which predict the effects of alterations in habitat sizefrom extrapolations of abundance to environment relationships as typ-ically undertaken in physical habitat modeling (29). Thus, although ithas been argued that river biota can be naturally resilient to variations inflow (30), our study highlights the strong vulnerability of river foodwebs to reductions in habitat size induced by flow reductions and issueswith the way the effects of many habitat-size reductions in rivers arecurrently assessed.Fig. 2. Overall effect of habitat-size constraints on trophic structure. Habitat size (A), by constraining predator size (B), subsequently affects predator/prey biomassratios (C and D) and capacity to support predator biomass (C) per unit of prey mass (D) based on our sampling in South Island, New Zealand rivers. For habitats sampled, areduction in habitat size from1.0 to 0.01m3·s−1 [streamdischarge (Q) associatedwith reducedwidth (W)] reduces predator size (for example, brown trout total length, from248 to51mm)basedonaback calculationof fishmass accounting for 50%of the cumulativebiomass (P50) using Eq. 1 [P50 (in gramsofDM)=46.26H1.04]. Applying results for Eq. 5 (that is,Bpred = 0.92H0.25 Bprey0.83, where Bpred is predator biomass per unit area,H is habitat size, and Bprey is primary consumer biomass per unit area, with units indicated in the diagrams)and assuming similar resource availability across habitats [(D), 3.23 g of DM·per square meter], this reduction in predator size leads to a substantial reduction in the predatorbiomass (C) being supported per unit of prey biomass.4 of 7SC I ENCE ADVANCES | R E S EARCH ART I C L EBody size allometry of metabolismThe general applicability of the theory depends on the combination andoccurrence of two fundamental biological scaling relationships: thebody mass allometry of metabolism and the habitat-size dependenceof predator mass. The quarter-power scaling of metabolism with bodymass relationship, which underpins Eq. 2, is due to thewell-known con-straints on how animals operate, principally the fractal geometry of re-source transport in animal bodies (31). Body size has far-reachinginfluences on multiple levels of organization (6), but the effect on therate of energy conversion is likely to be one of the most important(14). Our predictions are based on the assumption, encapsulated inEq. 2, that within-trophic–level mass-abundance scaling conforms toa three-quarter–power exponent. These relationships are twoof the fun-damental tenets of the metabolic theory of ecology (14). The within-trophic–level scaling of abundance and mass from metabolic theory(Eq. 2) applies broadly across biota (6), including freshwater fish, albeitwith variable slope (32). The emergent effect is that the metaboliceconomies of scale provided by greater body mass mean that commu-nities where larger predators predominate should be more efficient intheir energy use and trophic transfer and that communities made up oflarger predators should generally have more predator mass per unit ofprey mass than those with smaller predator body sizes.Because the scaling relationship in Eq. 1 depends on the body size ofpredators generally, not just on the body size of the largest predator in ahabitat, how the body size of the predator biomass was assessed is im-portant. We expect that the trophic efficiencies of lower metabolic ratesper unit of predator mass will only accrue if the body size of the collec-tive mass of predators present generally increases with habitat size, someasures such asP50 aremost appropriate. Equation 5 does not accountfor variation in temperature across habitats of different size; however,this could be achieved through the incorporation of a Boltzman activa-tion constant into Eqs. 1 to 5 (14). It might also be argued that real preyproduction may differ from the three-quarter–power scaling of stand-ing stock biomass assumed in Eq. 5. However, if factors affectingproductivity (for example, nutrient availability or temperature) are rela-tively consistent across the habitat size gradient or can be accounted foranalytically, then the scaling of standing primary consumer biomass is areliable measure of the energy from both autotrophic and heterotrophicenergy pathways available to predators.We treat all consumers at trophic levels above primary consumers asone guild of “predators,” when, in most food webs, there are consumersthat feed at multiple trophic levels above primary consumers (33). Thereare two reasons, connected to the jointly interacting bottom-up and top-down forces affecting foodwebs, for aggregating predators intoonepred-ator trophic level or guild. First, from a bottom-up perspective andassuming that allochthonous subsidies to organisms above primary con-sumers are minimal, the amount of energy available from primary con-sumers should be able to support all consumers at higher trophic levels(13). Second, and from a top-down perspective, it is quite possible thatreduced predator size associated with habitat-size constraints will releaselower-level predators from top-down control (see the SupplementaryMaterials and fig. S3). That will affect the distribution of biomass amongpredator sizes and trophic levels (inside the bottom-up constraint), sorather than making assumptions about which trophic level any top-down effect might influence, we grouped all predators into one guild.Habitat-size dependence of predator body massThe scaling of capacity to support predatorswith habitat size also hingeson the habitat-size dependence of predator body mass. The scaling ofMcIntosh et al., Sci. Adv. 2018;4 : eaap7523 4 July 2018predator body mass with habitat size has been widely observed, usuallywith respect tomaximumpredator size andwhenhabitat ismeasured asthe home-range size of individuals (9, 10). For freshwater fishes, themain top predators in our study rivers, the measured exponents of thescaling relationships between predator size andhabitat size (Eq. 1) followthe same general relationship, although the scaling exponent has some-times tended to be slightly less than expected (b =1) (16), possibly due tovariations in how the habitat size variable is defined (17). However, weobserved scaling of predator mass with habitat size measured by riverdischarge with a relationship very close to that defined in Eq. 1, sohow habitat size is defined may not be as important as measuring a var-iable, such as discharge in our case, that reflects the spatial dependence ofthe body size relationship.Cross-ecosystem subsidies, physical habitat disturbance, and bio-geographic constraints could also potentially influence predator bodysize (22). For example, Romero et al. (5) observed more top-heavy foodwebs in larger bromeliad phytotelmata habitats but found that this wasmore pronounced in stable climatic conditions. We specifically onlyconsidered relatively stable streams because disturbance can affect abun-dance of large predators regardless of habitat size (34). Similarly, cross-ecosystemprey additions fromproductive habitats (for example, forests)could facilitate larger predator sizes, so we only considered grasslandstreams. It is likely that large fishless streams, for example, wouldsupport comparatively small amounts of predator biomass per unit ofprey mass because they lack the metabolic efficiencies of having largepredators. Consistent with this, Petermann et al. (20) found that thestrong effects of habitat size on trophic structure in bromeliad phytotel-mata, leading to inverted biomass pyramids in large habitats, occurredmore at sites where odonates were present compared towhere theywerenot present. Thus, factors such as physical habitat disturbance andcross-ecosystem subsidies have the potential to explain additional vari-ance in these scaling relationships (5) and so are worthy of investigation.The scaling relationships driving predator body size likely occur be-cause habitat size affects the availability of and access to spatially distrib-uted resources that predators need (10). For example, experimentallyhalving the dimensions of streams with longitudinal fences withoutaltering productivity per unit area reduced the body size of predatoryfish present (34). Thus, if the area available for predators to forage effi-ciently is reduced, then their body size is likely to be constrained. Al-though rivers are open ecosystems due to longitudinal connectivity,for fish, rivers are also bounded ecosystems because the lateral limitsof habitats they can forage in are constrained to thewetted channel. Thisis likely to be particularly important for predators with indeterminategrowth such as fish, where environmental conditions have a large influ-ence on eventual body size, and could explainwhy fishmay not fit otherpredator-prey biomass scaling relationships (15), and for predators inother habitats (for example, African savanna) where habitat size con-straints may place fewer restrictions on predator size.Overall, our findings concurwith the three-quarter–power scaling ofpredator biomass with prey biomass reported by Hatton et al. (15),supporting the fundamental primacy of bottom-up energetic con-straints on predators. However, that habitat size explained substantialadditional variance in predator biomass also indicates the importance offurther factors in predator-prey biomass relationships. The dis-proportionate effects of habitat disruption on predator populations gen-erally, compared to organisms at other trophic levels, (2, 18, 19), and thesteeper slopes of species area curves at high trophic levels (35), agreewith our findings and suggest that predators are generally affected bythe constraints of habitat size.5 of 7SC I ENCE ADVANCES | R E S EARCH ART I C L EMATERIALS AND METHODSStudy designWe assessed empirical support for our predictions using measurementsassembled from 29 rivers in New Zealand using studies by our researchgroup, where invertebrate and fish biomass per unit area had beenmeasured during summer with Surber sampling and electrofishing, re-spectively (21, 36). Study reacheswere chosen to reflect typical conditionson independent first- to fourth-order streams and rivers in the Waima-kariri and Rakaia river catchments, South Island, New Zealand. Tomin-imize potential for variations in either availability of allochthonoussubsidies or habitat disturbance to influence our comparison, we onlyconsidered streams in grassland locations and those with single channelsthat had not been recently flooded, and we avoided flood-prone braidedrivers (table S1 and Supplementary Materials).Habitat size measurementHabitat size was quantified by river discharge, measured using thevelocity-area method at, or close to, the time of biological sampling.Habitat use by aquatic predators such as fish is highly dynamic and willlikely alter in response to even short-term fluctuations in habitat size, sowe wanted to know the actual sizes of habitat that predators were usingat the time of sampling.Discharge does not incorporate the longitudinaldimensions of river habitats or directly measure the home range of thefish.However, because discharge integrates both the cross-sectional areaof a channel and how the water moves through it, it is a more dynamicmeasure reflecting aspects of how organisms use the habitat. Thus, bycapturing the spatial dimensionmost likely to constrain the size of pred-ators within the sampled habitat, discharge measures habitat size in away that reflects our predictions. Alternative variables such as catch-ment area would also not provide a reliable measure of habitat sizefor groundwater-fed springs and rivers because these tended to havehigher discharge than predicted by catchment area (34).Invertebrate and fish samplingInvertebrates were sampled from five random locations in 25- to 35-m-long study reaches with Surber samplers (0.0625 m2, 250- or 300-mmmesh) and preserved in 70% ethanol. Preserved samples were sortedunder a dissectingmicroscope, followed by enumeration and identifica-tion with appropriate keys (37). DM was calculated (not includingcases and shells) either directly in bulk (36) or using length-weightregression based on representative samples of individuals (21).Fish were sampled with three-pass electrofishing within stop-nettedareas encompassing the dimensions of the study reach [see (34)]. Thelength of reaches sampled reflects areas that were logistically feasible tosample with electrofishing over the range of stream discharges con-sidered and that were appropriate for sampling the range of predatortypes in these rivers. In four rivers where large fish [rainbow trout(>300 mm fork length)] were present, the fish were captured in aseparate electrofishing operation within a larger reach size specificallytargeting them; this larger sample area was used in the calculation oflarge-fish abundance. Fish DM was calculated using length-weight re-gression of fish captured (38) and summed to quantify fish biomass.Statistical analysisWe classified predators as everything that was not a primary consumerusing diet information (21). This meant that all invertebrates known toconsume animal prey (predatory invertebrates) and all fish wereclassified as predators. All other invertebrates were classified as primaryconsumers (that is, taxa gaining most of their energy from algae,McIntosh et al., Sci. Adv. 2018;4 : eaap7523 4 July 2018bacteria, fungi, and detritus). Predator size P50 was calculated as the sizeof the individual predator accounting for 50% of the cumulative pred-ator biomass at each site, but other measures of predator size gave simi-lar results (see the Supplementary Materials).Although we lack the data necessary to produce secondary produc-tion estimates using standard cohort- or growth-based methods, we in-vestigated whether the main drivers of production [that is, body size,temperature, and standing biomass (39, 40)] varied systematically withhabitat size using data from a subset (n = 15) of our study streams forwhich appropriate temperature and body size data were available (fig.S1). Mean annual temperature was measured at half-hourly intervalsbetween September 2004 and September 2006 at the 15 sites withWT-HR 1000 loggers (TruTrack Instruments) (21). Body size andstanding biomass estimates were computed from the community datasets described above.In our statistical analyses, to evaluate empirical support for Eqs. 1 to5, we tested each prediction in turn and examined important assump-tions associated with those predictions. Power-law scaling relationshipswere fitted using linear least-squares regression on log10-transformeddata. We used AICc to evaluate one-parameter versus two-parametermodels. All analyses were run in R (version 3.2.3).SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALSSupplementary material for this article is available at http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/4/7/eaap7523/DC1Section S1.

An ability to predict the scale of effect of a landscape using species traits would make landscape study design more efficient and would enable landscape managers to plan at the appropriate scale. We used an individual based simulation model to predict how species traits influence the scale of effect. Specifically, we tested the effects of dispersal distance, reproductive rate, and informed movement behavior on the radius at which percent habitat cover best predicts population abundance in a focal area. Scale of effect for species with random movement behavior was compared to scale of effect for species with three (cumulative) levels of information use during dispersal: habitat based settlement, conspecific density based settlement, and gap-avoidance during movement. Consistent with a common belief among researchers, dispersal distance had a strong, positive influence on scale of effect. A general guideline for empiricists is to expect the radius of a landscape to be 4-9 times the median dispersal distance or 0. 3-0. 5 times the maximum dispersal distance of a species. Informed dispersal led to greater increases in population size than did increased reproductive rate. Similarly, informed dispersal led to more strongly decreased scales of effect than did reproductive rate. Most notably, gap-avoidance resulted in scales that were 0. 2-0. 5 times those of non-avoidant species.

Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis,156684036,The intermediate disturbance hypothesis: Patch dynamics and mechanisms of species coexistence,,"Roxburgh, Stephen, Shea, Katriona, Wilson, J Bastow",2015,"The intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) has been used for several decades as an explanation for the coexistence of species in ecological communities. It is intuitively simple, but deceptively so. We show, via discussion and examples, that the IDH is not one mechanism of coexistence, but rather summarizes a set of similar phenomena that can arise from the action of several different coexistence mechanisms. These underlying mechanisms are defined by the various ways in which species differ in their response to disturbance-induced spatial and temporal variability in resources and environmental conditions. As an example, the original specification of the IDH required patchy disturbances for coexistence. However, because the underlying mechanisms of coexistence can also operate at the within-patch scale, patchy disturbances are not a necessary requirement for coexistence under intermediate-disturbance regimes. These conclusions are illustrated through the analysis of three models: a spatial within-patch model, a spatial between-patch model, and a purely temporal model. All three generate similar patterns of coexistence under intermediate disturbance, yet underlying that coexistence lie at least two quite-distinct mechanisms of species coexistence: the storage effect and relative nonlinearity. The results from our analyses suggest that, as a promoter of species coexistence, the IDH is both broader in scope and richer in detail than has previously been recognized",,Journal article,"Keywords: coexistence; community ecology; environmental factor; intermediate disturbance hypothesis; patch dynamics Coexistence, mechanisms of; Environmental variability; Intermediate disturbance hypothesis; Nonlinearity, relative; Patch dynamics; Reciprocal-yield law (RYL) model; Species coexistence, storage effect",issn:0012-9658,Ecological Society of America

Here, we examine IDH in the context of alien plant invasions. IDH can offer insight into the role of disturbance in facilitating plant invasions and the effect of these invasions on floristic diversity. Early stages of succession are most susceptible to invasion because resources and colonisation opportunities are elevated after disturbance. This trend is accentuated by human-mediated dispersal, a bias towards early successional species in the alien species pool, the tendency for fast-growing species to profit most from enemy release, and increased disturbance levels in human-modified habitats. Human disturbance, coupled with plant introductions, extends the diversity–disturbance curve and shifts peak diversity towards higher disturbance levels. However, invasive aliens can reduce native diversity at the community scale, especially in mid succession where competitive interactions structure communities. Certain invasive plants may have higher impacts because they overcome some life history tradeoffs as a result of their association with humans or novel evolutionary histories, e.g. enemy release. This may directly or indirectly (e.g. through plastic reallocation of resources from defence into growth) enable invasive plants to colonise earlier or persist into later stages of succession. By modifying disturbance regimes, invaders that transform the environment may also interfere with succession and precipitate low diversity communities. Low introduction rates of late successional species may currently limit impacts of aliens under infrequent disturbance. IDH is a useful framework for understanding ecological communities. However, because of the novel evolutionary histories of alien species and the anthropogenic context in which they invade, disturbance levels that maximise total diversity in invaded communities can differ from those that maximise native diversity. Joint consideration of IDH and alien invasion patterns suggests a range of strategies can be used to manage diversity",,Journal Article,"alien species, biological diversity, life history tradeoffs, community ecology, species coexistence, succession",Perspectives in Plant Ecology Evolution and Systematics,Elsevier

KEYWORDS frequency; intensity; severity; typhoon   3  1 | INTRODUCTION Disturbances play an important role in ecosystem structure, function, and dynamics. Large disturbances can reset community development and initiate secondary succession, while in the absence of disturbance a community will eventually reach mature ecosystem state (Whittaker, 1953, 1974; Horn, 1974). A key discussion in ecosystem ecology is the relationship between disturbance and diversity. Disturbances have the potential to alter species diversity directly through differential species removal and indirectly through modifying the biotic and abiotic environments and thereby altering the species competition (Glitzenstein, Harcombe, & Streng, 1986; Hughes et al., 2007). Many theories and hypotheses have been developed to describe and predict the relationship between disturbance and species diversity. Among them, the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) (Connell, 1978; Ward and Stanford, 1983) is fundamental in explaining and predicting disturbance-diversity relationships. The IDH has been debated over the past decades with no clear consensus on how well it can be applied to the actual ecosystems. In this commentary, we used results from empirical studies of tropical cyclone disturbance on forest ecosystems to illustrate several key limitations of the IDH and reveal previously overlooked processes that are essential to the disturbance-diversity relationship.  2 | RETHINKING THE INTERMEDIATE DISTURBANCE HYPOTHESIS The IDH predicts that local species diversity (i.e., richness) peaks at intermediate frequencies and spatial extents of disturbance (Connell, 1978). The mechanisms that lead to the peak local diversity at intermediate disturbance is that at low disturbance (both in terms of frequency and intensity), the community is disproportionally made up of species that are best adapted to the prevailing environmental conditions, and when disturbance is too large, 4  many species are removed by the disturbance (Petraitis, Latham, & Niesenbaum, 1989; Wilson & Tilman, 2002; Catford et al., 2012). The IDH has been both supported (Mollino and Sabatier, 2001, Roxburgh, Shea, & Wilson; 2004, Bongers et al., 2009, Zimmerman et al. 2014) and challenged (Hubbell et al., 1999; Miller, Roxburgh, & Shea, 2011; Fox 2013) by large numbers of studies, with the latter mostly using laboratory experiments or theoretical studies. As a support to IDH, using a sample of 17,000 trees in a Guianan forest, with a wide range of disturbance intensities, Molino and Sabatier (2001) reported peaked species richness at intermediate disturbance levels. Using another large-scale dataset, Bongers et al. (2009) illustrated that richness peaks at intermediate disturbance in tropical dry forests. At the same time, there are many studies challenging the IDH. Fox (2013) argued that the IDH is empirically refuted by the lack of humped shape of diversity along the disturbance gradient in many cases and the mechanisms that contribute to high levels of diversity at intermediate disturbance are logically invalid. Using a model of two competing plant species subject to disturbance of varying intensities and frequencies, Miller, Roxburgh, & Shea (2011) demonstrated that a single simple model can theoretically generate several different disturbance-diversity relationships. However, it has been argued that many criticism about the IDH are misguided because they fail to acknowledge that the effects of disturbance on diversity co-vary with productivity (Huston, 2014).  Although the mechanisms provided by the IDH have been challenged both theoretically and experimentally, to our knowledge, few studies have empirically tested the theoretical mechanisms of the IDH using results from actual ecosystems. Based on empirical results of studies on plant species diversity in relation to tropical cyclone disturbance, we examined the two fundamental mechanisms of the IDH, maximized competitive exclusion under low disturbance and maximized species loss under high disturbance. We also highlight key 5  processes driving the disturbance-diversity relationship that have not been explicitly addressed previously. Tropical cyclones are among the most-common natural disturbances globally and their frequency and intensity are projected to increase in many parts of the world in the future (Emanuel 2005, 2013; Chand, Tory, Ye, & Walsh, 2017; Ibanez et al., 2018). In fact, tropical cyclone disturbance was used many times to illustrate the IDH by Connell (1978). The IDH predicts a low level local species richness under high disturbance, however, empirical studies from Taiwan, an island under frequent and intense typhoon disturbances do not support such a prediction. Taiwan experiences three to six landfall typhoons annually, with approximately 40% of the typhoons category 3 (Saffir-Simpson scale, wind speed 50-58 m s-1) or greater (Lin et al., 2011). Thus, typhoon disturbance in Taiwan is at the very high end of the cyclone disturbance spectrum. Northeastern Taiwan had a record of six typhoons in 1994, with two of them category 3 at landfall. However, tree mortality caused by the 1994 typhoons was only 1.4% and there was no differential removal of tree species at a low elevation forest (Mabry et al., 1998). When mortality is low and not many species are preferentially removed, frequent cyclone disturbance may help to maintain or even enhance tree diversity (Lin et al., 2018). Sometimes higher local species richness can indeed result from high disturbance intensity. For example, in the Caribbean basin of central America where major hurricanes occur once or twice a decade (Walker, Lodge, Brokaw, & Waide, 1991), Vandermeer et al. (2000) reported that after the category 4 (wind speed 58-70 m s-1) Hurricane Joan (1988) affected Nicaragua, species richness was higher in disturbed forests than undisturbed forests. These observations clearly demonstrate that intensive disturbance that affects an extensive area does not always lead to lower diversity as predicted by the IDH. We argue that seed recruitment under cyclone disturbance disrupts the disturbance-6  diversity relationship predicted by the IDH. The pioneer species rely on large seed reserves in the seed bank to achieve abundance after cyclone disturbance. However, with extensive disturbance of high intensity, seed recruitment of pioneer species will not be sufficient to saturate the damaged area so that they can not suppress the large suite of slower-growing species as they often do under less intensive disturbances (Vandermeer et al., 2000).  Another important limitation of the IDH is the lack of distinction between the effects of disturbance frequency and intensity on species diversity. Connell (1978) proposed that the same reasoning used to explain the disturbance frequency-diversity relationship can be applied to explain disturbance intensity (and area)-diversity relationship. However, it is widely recognized in fire ecology that frequent fires are typically less intense and have smaller spatial coverage while infrequent fires are usually intense and cover much broader areas and their effects on plant diversity are likely different (Pickett and White, 1985, Turner et al., 1989; Steel, Safford, & Viers, 2015). Similar to fires, the effects of different tropical cyclone disturbance regimes (e.g., frequent and intense, frequent but less intense, and rare but intense) on tree diversity are also different.  Another limitation of IDH in explaining disturbance-diversity relationship is the lack of consideration of organismal adaptations to disturbance. According to the IDH, tree diversity is low under frequent and intense cyclone disturbance regime. Lin et al. (2017) used empirical evidence to illustrate that strong typhoons do not lead to low levels of local species diversity because of low tree mortality. The low tree mortality even during most intense typhoons is likely resulted from the development of adaptations to frequent typhoon disturbance. Natural disturbances have been interacting with ecosystems for hundreds of thousands of years and spanning over many generations of trees in many regions. It is therefore not surprising that selection had resulted in forests with structure, 7  composition, and functional traits that are adaptive to cyclone disturbance such as short stature and heavy defoliation that would minimize their mortality (Francis and Alemany, 2003; Lin et al. 2017). Adaptations also likely contributed to the finding that cyclonic storms generally have a greater effect on forest composition and dynamics on forests with less frequent cyclone disturbance than on those with more frequent disturbance reported by Hogan et al. (2018). We believe that the overlooked role of adaptations by the IDH is one reason for the lack of humped-shape disturbance-diversity relationship in many cases.  Lastly, we believe that there is an important distinction between disturbance intensity and disturbance severity, and one cannot be interchanged with the other. Intensity is a physical attribute of disturbance (e.g., the strength of the disturbing force) and severity is the biophysical impact, such as the magnitude of tree mortality caused by disturbance (Iwasaki and Noda, 2018). When testing the IDH, some researchers have confused disturbance severity with disturbance intensity, which is subjected to criticism. For example, Molino and Sabatier (2001) provided a testing of the IDH at the light-gap level, in which they used tree mortality to estimate disturbance level. In the criticism to the IDH, Huston (2014) sometimes also used mortality in substitution of disturbance intensity to describe possible outcomes of the disturbance-diversity relationship. It is problematic to use disturbance severity instead of disturbance intensity to define the scale of the disturbance. For example, it is inappropriate to classify the category 3 Typhoon Herb as a small disturbance just because it caused less than 1% tree mortality (Lin et al., 2011). Such confusion is especially problematic in forest management aiming to mitigate the disturbance effects. For example, through thinning it is possible to reduce tree mortality caused by a category 3 tropical cyclone but it would be misleading to then use the low tree mortality to claim that the tropical cyclone is a small one.  8  3 | PROPOSED OUTCOMES OF CYCLONE DISTURBANCE-DIVERSITY RELATIONSHIP Based on empirical results, we summarized nine combinations along the frequency and intensity gradients and pointed out seven possible outcomes of cyclone disturbance- diversity relationships (Figure 1). When cyclone intensities are low, their effect on tree survival and growth is minor, tree diversity is likely insensitive to cyclone disturbance regardless of the frequency (Figure 1A). In contrast, infrequent but high intensity cyclones could cause high tree mortality. High tree mortality that is not evenly distributed among tree species could reduce tree diversity as predicted by the IDH. In such cases, if the frequency is low, with a return interval of several decades or longer, tree diversity is reduced following the disturbance for one to several decades (Figure 1E). Then canopy tree species removed by the disturbance can regain their niches in the forest as long as there is sufficient supply of seedlings from the seed bank. If the frequency is high, such as in northern Taiwan, species that are vulnerable to the typhoons have too short a period to regain their niches once removed by the disturbance (Figure 1G). Within the same region, there could be a gradient of cyclone intensity under similar cyclone frequency. For example, in Taiwan, where typhoon disturbance occurs on an annual basis, typhoon intensity decreases from low to high elevations, due to the disruption of typhoon structure by the rough topography and cooler temperatures at high elevations. Thus, there is a disturbance intensity gradient under high disturbance frequency (i.e., increasing intensity from scenarios A, D, and G). In the northeastern United States, where hurricanes occur one to several times a century, the decreases in hurricane intensity from coast to inland portray a disturbance intensity gradient under low disturbance frequency (i.e., increasing intensity from scenarios A, B, and E). In the Central America, where hurricane occurs once or twice a decade, the decreases in hurricane intensity from east to west coast illustrate a disturbance intensity gradient under 9  intermediate disturbance frequency (i.e., increasing intensity from scenarios A, C, and F). The effects of cyclone disturbance on tree diversity likely vary along each of the intensity gradients and the lack of distinction between frequency and intensity effects makes the IDH of limited applicability in the actual ecosystems. The seven possible outcomes agree with the theoretical model of Miller, Roxburgh & Shea (2011) and the experimental populations of microbes used by Hall et al. (2012) that describe changes in disturbance-diversity relationships with different combinations of disturbance frequency and intensity. However, our predicted outcomes are based on results from empirical field studies.   4 | Summary Based on empirical field observations from regions under tropical cyclone influences, we have illustrated that some key limitations of the IDH are the lack of distinction between the effects of disturbance frequency and intensity on species diversity, the lack of consideration of organismal adaptations to disturbance, and the lack of distinction between disturbance intensity and disturbance severity. We also showed that intensive disturbance does not always lead to lower diversity and revealed previously overlooked processes (i.e., role of tree mortality and tree adaptations) that are essential to the disturbance-diversity relationship. We have summarized seven possible outcomes of cyclone disturbance-diversity relationships, pointing out the diverse consequences resulting from different disturbance intensity and frequency combinations.

Seven possible outcomes of gap dynamics and tree diversity in relation to disturbance as a result of different frequency and intensity combinations. In places such as Taiwan where typhoon disturbance is on an annual basis, the decreases in typhoon intensity from low to high elevations, due to the destruction of typhoon structure by the rough topography and cooler temperatures at high elevations, represent a gradient of increasing disturbance intensity (i.e., scenarios A, D, and G) under high disturbance frequency. In the Central America, where hurricanes occur once or twice a decade, the decreases in hurricane from east coast to west coast illustrate a gradient of intermediate disturbance frequency but increasing disturbance intensity (i.e., scenarios A, C, and F). The scenario C represents the co-existence of shade-tolerant and –intolerant species under intermediate intensity and intermediate frequency due to low competitive exclusion as predicted by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Their co-existence, however, is not limited to scenario C but also in other scenarios (e.g., D, G) due to different reasons. In the northeastern United States, where hurricanes occur one to several times a century, the decreases in hurricane intensity from coast to inland portray a gradient of increasing disturbance intensity under low disturbance frequency (i.e., scenarios A, B and E).

The link between disturbance and species diversity can be explained by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, which posits that areas experiencing, in terms of frequency and intensity, intermediate levels of disturbance will exhibit the highest levels of species diversity. By assessing species diversity across six sites different in their disturbance regimes in the Highland Creek ravine in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the intermediate disturbance can be tested. This was done by obtaining samples of each species within a 4x4m quadrat set up at each site, estimating total percent cover, and identifying the species as either invasive or native. As predicted by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, species diversity was found to be highest in plots three and four, which both experience intermediate levels of disturbance.

The amplitude of this body sway is known to be larger than would be predicted from simple noise effects, and sway characteristics are changed by neurological disorders. This large sway is thought to arise from nonlinear control with prolonged periods of no control (intermittent control), and a nonlinear control system of this kind has been predicted to exhibit bifurcation. The presence of stability-dependent transition enables dynamic reaction that depends on the stability of the environment, and can explain the change in sway characteristics that accompanies some neurological disorders. This research analyses the characteristics of a system model that induces transition, and discusses whether human standing reflects such a mechanism. In mathematical analysis of system models, (intermittent control-like) nonlinear control with integral control is shown to exhibit Hopf bifurcation. Moreover, from the analytical solution of the system model with noise, noise is shown to work to smooth the enlargement of sway around the bifurcation point. This solution is compared with measured human standing sway on floors with different stabilities.

In reality, these shifts are often caused by slow forces external to the system that eventually push it over a tipping point. Theory predicts that when ecological systems are brought close to atipping point, the dynamical feedback intrinsic to the system interact with intrinsic noise and extrinsic perturbations in characteristic ways. The resulting phenomena thus serve as “early warning signals” for shifts such as population collapse. In this chapter, we review the basic(qualitative) theory of such systems. We then illustrate the main ideas with a series of models that both represent fundamental ecological ideas (e.g. density-dependence) and are amenable to mathematical analysis.

We investigate analytically, using an asymptotic analysis, the response regimes resulting from the interaction between the two unstable linear modes of the primary structure and the NES.

Firstly, the mean square stability matrix is obtained from the stability theory of stochastic systems, and three stability indexes (root-mean-square resilience, root-mean-square reactivity and root-mean-square amplification envelope) of the ecosystem response to stochastic disturbances are calculated. We find that: (1) no matter which population is disturbed, increasing the intensity of disturbance improves the ability of the system leaves steady state and thus decreases the stability. The root-mean-square amplification envelope rises with increasing disturbance intensity, (2) the system is more sensitive to the disturbance of the predator than disturbance to prey, (3) ρmax and tmax are important indicators, which represent the intensity and time of maximum amplification by disturbance. These findings are helpful for managers to take corresponding management measures to reduce the disturbances, especially for predators, thereby avoiding the possible change of the structure and functions of the ecosystem",,article,"resilience, reactivity, amplification envelope, square root functional response, asymptotic and transient dynamics, Mathematics, QA1-939",Mathematics,MDPI AG

We show that dynamical stability, quantified via the response to external perturbations (i.e. perturbation of dynamical variables), coincides with the minimal internal perturbation (i.e. perturbations of interactions between variables) able to render the system unstable. First, by reformulating a result of control theory, we explain that harmonic external perturbations reflect the spectral sensitivity of the Jacobian matrix at the equilibrium, with respect to constant changes of its coefficients. However, for this equivalence to hold, imaginary changes of the Jacobian’s coefficients have to be allowed. The connection with dynamical stability is thus lost for real dynamical systems. We show that this issue can be avoided, thus recovering the fundamental link between dynamical and structural stability, by considering stochastic noise as external and internal perturbations. More precisely, we demonstrate that a linear system’s response to white-noise perturbations directly reflects the intensity of internal white-noise disturbance that it can accommodate before becoming stochastically unstable",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/article, Journal articles","non-normal matrices, external perturbations, internal perturbations, stability radius, linear systems, white-noise perturbations, [MATH.MATH-DS]Mathematics [math]/Dynamical Systems [math.DS], [SDV.EE]Life Sciences [q-bio]/Ecology, environment",,'The Royal Society'

The flow dynamics is first analyzed by means of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which highlights the simultaneous occurrence of two types of flow modes, namely a low-frequency type associated with breathing motion of the separation bubble, accompanied by flapping motion of the reflected shock, and a high-frequency type associated with the propagation of instability waves past the interaction zone. Global linear stability analysis performed on the mean LES flow fields yields a single unstable zero-frequency mode, plus a variety of marginally stable low-frequency modes whose stability margin decreases with the strength of the interaction. The least stable linear modes are grouped into two classes, one of which bears striking resemblance to the breathing mode recovered from DMD and another class associated with revolving motion within the separation bubble. The results of the modal and linear stability analysis support the notion that low-frequency dynamics is intrinsic to the interaction zone, but some continuous forcing from the upstream boundary layer may be required to keep the system near a limit cycle.

The development of strategies to minimize the risk of falling in the elderly represents a major challenge for aging, in industrialized societies. The cor-rective movements made by humans to maintain balance are small amplitude, inter-mittent and ballistic. Small amplitude, complex oscillations (micro-chaos) frequently arise in industrial settings when a time-delayed digital processor attempts to stabilize an unstable equilibrium. Taken together these observations motivate considerations of the effects of a sensory threshold on the stabilization of an inverted pendulum by time-delayed feedback. In the resulting switching-type delay differential equations, the sensory threshold is a strong small-scale nonlinearity which has no effect on large-scale stabilization, but may produce complex, small amplitude dynamics in-cluding limit cycle oscillations and micro-chaos. A close mathematical relationship exists between a scalar model for balance control and the micro-chaotic map that arises in some models of digitally controlled machines. Surprisingly, transient, time-dependent, bounded solutions (transient stabilization) can arise even for parameter ranges where the equilibrium is asymptotically unstable. In other words the combi-nation of a sensory threshold with a time-delayed sampled feedback can increase the range of parameter values for which balance can be maintained, at least transiently. Neuro-biological observations suggest that sensory thresholds can be manipulated either passively by changing posture or actively using efferent feedback. Thus it may be possible to minimize the risk of falling by means of strategies that manipulate sensory thresholds by using physiotherapy and appropriate exercises. ",,text,,,Springer

The method has three main steps. The first step consists in the diagonalization of the primary underline linear system using the so-called biorthogonal transformation. Within the assumption of a primary system with only one unstable mode the dynamics of the diagonalized system is reduced ignoring the stable modes and keeping only the unstable mode. The complexification method is applied in the second step with the aim of obtaining the slow-flow of the reduced system. Then, the third step is an asymptotic analysis of the slow-flow based geometric singular perturbation theory. The analysis shows that the critical manifold of the system can be reduced to a one dimensional parametric curve evolving in a multidimensional space. The shape and the stability properties of the critical manifold and the stability properties of the fixed points of the slow-flow provide an analytical tool to predict the nature of the possible steady-state regimes of the system. Finally, two examples are considered to evaluate the effectiveness and advancement of the proposed method. The method is first applied to the prediction of the mitigation limit of a breaking system subject to friction-induced vibrations coupled to two NESs, and next an airfoil model undergoing an aeroelastic instability coupled to a NESs setup (from one to four) is discussed. Theoretical results are compared, for validation purposes, to direct numerical integration of the system.

Such a transition is optimized for a specific value of the noise correlation time of an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck forcing, as a consequence of the coupling of the involved deterministic and stochastic time scales. Here, it is shown that the deterministic time scale is related to the dynamics of the system close to a stability boundary. The escaping process depicts a survival distribution function similar to the one observed in human stick balancing, a task known to involve a truncated Lévy forcing. Here, it is shown that such extreme distribution favours the stabilisation of an inverted pendulum, when compared with a normal forcing, and the system parameters are close to a stability boundary. This outcome suggests that an unstable dynamics may temporarily avoid an extinguishing transition if the extreme forcing is able to tune the system parameters at specific time delay values (of physiological significance) close to the stability boundary.

This study assesses lateral tipping, as opposed to sliding, MIIs of standing persons in a simulated motion environment representing dry deck conditions. Results verify previous findings that MII occurrence increases with increasing peak sway acceleration. Although MII occurrence was associated with the frequency of the motion stimulus, the effect is not as clear as that of acceleration. Overall, results suggest that complex, multidirectional motions create more tipping MIIs than unidirectional motion. Beyond acceleration, MII research also should incorporate frequency characteristics and motion complexity as factors influencing MII occurrence.  In this study, we introduce the “probable” MII, a novel term referring to a slight, temporary loss of balance without tipping. This term fills the gap between the theoretical definition of an MII and a human-centered perception of an MII, where loss of balance is not a binary phenomenon. From a human performance perspective, the investigation of the “probable” MIIs may be of a value because they are more common than the “definite” MIIs (depending on the motion profile, this difference ranged from 16% to 67%).  As a result of these findings, we developed a mathematical model of MII occurrence based on the amplitude and period of motion stimulus acceleration. The model assumes an additive combination two functions: a generalized logistic associated with the amplitude of acceleration and a Gaussian for period.

Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis,103852792,"Rate-induced Bifurcations: Critical Rates, Non-obvious Thresholds, and Adaptation Failure",,"Sebastian Wieczorek, Michel Destrade",2016,"Many natural and technological systems fail to adapt to changing external conditions and move to a different state if the conditions vary too fast. We conceptualise the failure to adapt as a rate-induced bifurcation — a nonautonomous instability characterised by critical rates of change and instability thresholds. Such instabilities occur in systems with a (unique) stable state that exists continuously for all fixed values of the external conditions. When external conditions vary in time, the position of the stable state changes and the system tries to keep pace with the changes. However, some systems fail to track the continuously changing stable state and destabilise above some critical rate of change. Scientists are often puzzled by rate-induced bifurcations because there is no ’obvious ’ loss of stability. Mathematically, rate-induced bifurcations cannot, in general, be described by classical bifur-cation theory or asymptotic approaches. Thus, they require an alternative approach. I will present an approach based on geometric singular perturbation theory to study critical rates of change and often intricate instability thresholds in terms of folded singularities and canard tra-jectories. The mathematical approach will be illustrated using the “compost-bomb instability” — a sudden and unexpected release of soil carbon from peatlands into the atmosphere above some critical rate of global warming.

Kinematic modelling studies have suggested that slab breakoff can account for this post-collisional magmatism through the formation of a slab window and subsequent heating of the overriding plate and decompression melting of upwelling asthenosphere, particularly if breakoff occurs at depths shallower than the overriding plate.To constrain the nature of any melting and the geodynamic conditions required, we numerically model the collision of two continental plates following a period of oceanic subduction. A thermodynamic database is used to determine the (de)hydration reactions and occurrence of melt throughout this process. We investigate melting conditions within a parameter space designed to generate a wide range of breakoff depths, timings and collisional styles.Under most circumstances, slab breakoff occurs deeper than the depth extent of the overriding plate; too deep to generate any decompressional melting of dry upwelling asthenosphere or thermal perturbation within the overriding plate. Even if slab breakoff is very shallow, the hot mantle inflow into the slab window is not sustained long enough to sufficiently heat the hydrated overriding plate to cause significant magmatism. Instead, for relatively fast, shallow breakoff we observe melting of asthenosphere above the detached slab through the release of water from the tip of the heating detached slab. Melting of the subducted continental crust during necking and breakoff is a more common feature and may be a more reliable indicator of the occurrence of breakoff. We suggest that magmatism from slab breakoff alone is unable to explain several of the characteristics of post-collisional magmatism, and that additional geodynamical processes need to be considered when interpreting magmatic observations",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/article, Journal articles","subduction, slab breakoff, magmatism, continental collision, numerical modelling, [SDU.STU.PE]Sciences of the Universe [physics]/Earth Sciences/Petrography",,'Elsevier BV'

Theory in ecology and evolution often relies on the analysis of invasion processes, and general approaches exist to understand the early stages of an invasion. However, predicting the long-term transformations of communities following an invasion remains a challenging endeavour. 2. We propose a general analytical method that uses both resident community and invader dynamical features to predict whether an invasion causes large long-term impacts on the invaded community. 3. This approach reveals a direction in which classic invasion analysis, based on initial invasion growth rate, can be extended. Indeed, we explain how the density dependence of invasion growth, if properly defined, synthetically encodes the long-term biotic transformations caused by an invasion, and therefore predicts its ultimate outcome. This approach further clarifies how the density dependence of the invasion growth rate is as much a property of the invading population as it is one of the invaded community. 4. Our theory applies to any stable community model, and directs us towards new questions that may enrich the toolset of invasion analysis, and suggests that indirect interactions and dynamical stability are key determinants of invasion outcomes.Funding Agencies|H2020 European Research Council [666971]; Agence Nationale de la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR)European Commission [ANR-10-LABX-41]; VetenskapsradetSwedish Research Council [VR-2017-05245]; Irish Research CouncilIrish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology [IRCLA/2017/186]</p",,"Article in journal, info:eu-repo/semantics/article, text","adaptive dynamics; alternative stable states; coexistence; ecological stability; extinctions; feedback loops; invasion fitness; press perturbation, Ecology, Ekologi",,'Wiley'

Traditionally, melt quantities are estimated by semi-analytical models or parameterized results from hydrocode simulations that calculate impact-induced melt. These so-called scaling laws roughly estimate the melt volume using basic impactor and target properties, which are assumed constant. The latter is valid for homogenous targets which usually applies for relatively small impact events, but it becomes more problematic if the impact significantly affects deeper target regions where target properties substantially change. Furthermore, previous studies indicate that plastic work and decompression melting can significantly contribute to the total melt production, which is usually not considered by scaling laws.    We aim at developing more accurate melt predictions that include a comprehensive representation of target and projectile interdependencies during large collisions throughout the history of the solar system. To this end, we run numerical models of impact events using the iSALE shock physics code, which we have extended with a massless Lagrangian tracer-based method to account for the target's thermal profile, decompression melting and plastic work. As a general representation of bodies that exist or have existed in the solar system, we consider a set of generic models of terrestrial planets and planetesimals. For these target bodies we calculate the radial thermal structure by employing parameterized thermal evolution models that account for partial melting of the mantle and crustal growth. The resulting interior structure of the target body at different times and evolution stages is then used as the initial condition for the impact simulations",,"Konferenzbeitrag, NonPeerReviewed",Planetenphysik,,

Impact-induced melting of crustal and mantle materials leads to the formation of local and regional melt ponds, and the cumulative effects of the impact flux could result in widespread melting of the crust. To quantify impact-melt production, its provenance and final distribution as a function of impact conditions, we carried out a systematic parameter study using the iSALE shock physics code. In contrast to simplified scaling laws for estimating the amount of melt generated by shock compression, we take the planet's thermal state at the time of impact into account. In addition, we consider decompression melting as a consequence of lithostatic uplift of initially deep-seated material. We find that the geothermal profile has a strong effect on melt production, and that melt volumes are significantly increased by up to a factor of seven in comparison to existing analytical estimates. Enhanced melting occurs at impactor sizes (and velocities) that deposit most of their energy at a depth close to the base of the lithosphere. Impactors larger than 10 km penetrate through the lithosphere and can generate a significant amount of melt by decompression due to lithostatic uplift, which can make up to 40% of the total melt volume. In some cases, the total melt volume exceeds the volume of the transient (and final) crater and the surface expression of these collisions may resemble large igneous provinces rather than typical craters",,"Zeitschriftenbeitrag, PeerReviewed",Planetenphysik,,Elsevier

Three possible reactions were tested: low temperature solidus representing H2O-fluid-saturated partial melting, and two end-member reaction curves for dehydration melting. Thermo-mechanical effects of partial melting were implemented as (1) a viscosity decrease as a determined rheologically critical melt percentage was reached (here 0.1), (2) a change in effective heat capacity and adiabatic heating/cooling accounting for a latent heat term in the heat equation. Among the 3 tested reactions, only H2O-fluid-saturated partial melting drastically modifies the collision dynamics from the non-melting reference model holding all other parameters constant. A substantially low general viscosity truncation (here 1017 Pa s) is needed to properly resolve the effect of partial melting on deep collision processes. Low temperature melting indeed induces the development of a low viscosity buoyant plume prior to slab detachment, where migmatites exhume from UHP conditions at rates and with pressure–temperature paths similar to the natural values acknowledged for the Norwegian Caledonides. High temperature melting has no drastic influence on early collision dynamics. While positive buoyancy remains the first order driver for the exhumation of buried continental rocks, exhumation initiates in these cases with eduction subsequent to slab detachment. Melting and formation of a migmatite plume can later occur along decompression path while continental crust undergoes thermal reequilibration at temperatures above 900 °C. Some of the partially molten material can also relaminate in the overriding plate rather than exhume within the collision zone. Even if minor in terms of amount of magma produced, H2O-fluid-saturated partial melting at UHP conditions could therefore have a dramatic rheological effect and actually limits continental rocks subduction and facilitates their exhumation",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/article, Journal articles","ultrahigh pressure metamorphism, continental subduction, partial melting, [SDU.STU.GP]Sciences of the Universe [physics]/Earth Sciences/Geophysics [physics.geo-ph]",,'Elsevier BV'

The considered time window is that of catastrophic acceleration, starting at incipient failure and ending when the acquired displacement and velocity are such that the sliding material begins to break up into pieces. The model accounts for temperature rise in the slip zone due to the heat produced by friction, leading to water expansion, thermoplastic collapse of the soil skeleton, and subsequent increase of pore water pressure. The model incorporates the processes of heat production and diffusion, pore pressure generation and diffusion, and an advanced constitutive law for the thermo-mechanical behavior of soil. An analysis of the Vajont landslide is presented as an example. A sensitivity analysis shows that friction softening is the mechanism most affecting the timescale of the final collapse of a slide, but also that the mechanism of thermal pressurization alone can cause a comparably catastrophic dynamic evolution.

Keywords: extinction, impact theory, Deccan volcanism, dinosaur extinction   CONFLICTING THEORIES  3 Conflicting Theories: Impact and Volcanism There have been five major mass extinctions in Earth’s history, but none of them are more talked about than the K-T (Cretaceous-Tertiary) extinction. Also known as the extinction of the dinosaurs, the event happened 65 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period and beginning of the formerly named Tertiary period, now renamed the Paleogene period (Lydon, 2016, para. 2). Because of this, it is now often referred to as the K-Pg extinction. While the events “claim to fame” is the extinction of the dinosaurs, not much is ever made of the massive loss of plant life that was suffered, especially planktic foraminifera, which suffered the biggest loss of life compared to any other organism (Keller, Sahni, & Bajpai, 2009, p. 724). Over time, scientists have had many different theories about what caused the extinction event but the main two are a large asteroid impact and volcanism. To this day the most accepted theory is that of the asteroid impact, but it is still debated by many.  Impact Theory The well-known and widely agreed upon theory is that a large asteroid crashed into the earth and put in motion the chain of events that caused the mass extinction. This conclusion was birthed when Nobel prize winner Luis Alvarez, his son Walter, and some coworkers discovered a large amount of iridium at the K-Pg boundary (formerly known as the K-T boundary) in Gubbio, Italy, in 1977 (Yarris, 2010, para. 3). This was a significant find because the element iridium is rarely found on Earth’s surface, and the small amount that is on the surface came from asteroids (Benton, 2011, para. 21). After the iridium was found in Italy, they found similar spikes of the element in Denmark and New Zealand, which led to Alvarez’s team coming up with the theory of a massive asteroid impact (Alvarez, Alvarez, Asaro, & Michel, 1980). But, something that is CONFLICTING THEORIES  4 not usually mentioned when speaking about the extinction of the dinosaurs is that the main theory is that the impact itself did not cause the extinction; the lasting effects the impact had on the environment did. The team concluded that the asteroid impact would have created a massive cloud of dust that engulfed the earth, blocked out the sun, and prevented photosynthesis, ensuring death for plants and the many organisms that relied on plant life to survive (Benton, 2011, para. 23). After years of research, we now know that his theory was very accurate.  Impact Theory: Evidence For and Against The place where the asteroid landed, Chicxulub (chick-shoo-loob) crater, was discovered in the 1940s (Urrutia-Fucugauchi, & Perez-Cruz, 2008, p. 248) but was not associated with the extinction event until 1991 (Yarris, 2010, para. 8) when it had been further investigated and dated. The 10-kilometer wide asteroid (“Experts Reaffirm,” 2010, para. 15) touched down in modern day Mexico and created the crater, which is about 180-200 kilometers in diameter (Urrutia-Fucugauchi et al., 2008, p. 248). They know that this is the crater from the asteroid that caused the extinction because at the K-Pg boundary, the layers of sediment are thick and full of material ejected from the crash, but as you get further away from the site, the layers begin getting thinner and there is a decrease in the material until there is only one thin layer that is seen globally that perfectly coincides with the time of the extinction (“Experts Reaffirm,” 2010, para. 9). This, along with the discovery of the Chicxulub crater, is solid evidence that proves the impact theory to be correct. Even after the revelation that the Chicxulub crater was the impact site of the asteroid, it was still not enough to convince some scientists that volcanic eruptions did not kill the dinosaurs, but for good reason. At the time, Alvarez’s theory still had holes in it that had not yet been CONFLICTING THEORIES  5 explained. For example, many articles point out the fact that when the Chicxulub impact zone was drilled into, the evidence they discovered showed that the impact occurred 300,000 years before the K-Pg boundary extinction, so it could not have been the cause of the event (Keller, Adatte, Stinnesbeck, Stuben, Berner, Kramar, & Harting, 2004). This find is so important because it is one of the main arguments used against the impact theory. However, in a 2010 study conducted by a panel of experts, they refuted that claim by explaining how the area around the impact site is unreliable because the sheer force of the asteroid impacting the Earth would have created a complex and disturbed layer of sediments compared to areas further away from the impact zone (“Experts Reaffirm,” 2010, para. 7). Because of all the force the asteroid hit the earth with, the impact site is the most damaged area that could be studied. That fact does not completely invalidate the findings, but it provides a very good explanation for them. Deccan Volcanism Before the impact theory was introduced, the popular theory was volcanism, specifically Deccan volcanism. Deccan volcanism is the term used to describe the massive eruptions of the Deccan traps that covered India in lava 65 million years ago, with some eruptions spreading over 1,000 kilometers across India, according to Keller et al. (2009, p. 709). Keller, who is Professor of Paleontology and Geology at Princeton University, is a huge advocate for the theory of volcanism. She and her team state that studies have shown that there were three short phases of eruptions (p. 715). Phase one was very small, happened around 67.4 to 67.5 million years ago, and only lasted about 10 thousand years (p. 715). Phase two was much larger than phase one and phase three; it was about 80% of the full volume of Deccan traps eruptions (p. 715). The lasting time of phase two is unknown, but it ended either at or very close to the extinction event (p. 715). It is considered to be the main phase because of the amount of damage it caused. Phase three, CONFLICTING THEORIES  6 much like phase one, was small, being less than 20% of the total volume of eruptions and occurred around 270 thousand years after the K-Pg boundary (p. 715). The theory is that when these eruptions occurred, mainly the first two, they would have initiated environment changes such as acidic rain, decreased pH levels in the water, depletion of the ozone, and global temperature changes that over a long period of time, would have caused a large portion of the life on Earth to die out (Tsujita, 2001, p. 279).  Deccan Volcanism: Evidence For and Against The timing of the Deccan trap eruptions is one of the main cases made in defending the volcanism theory. The eruption of the traps was right around the time of the K-Pg extinction, and researchers at the University of California, Berkely insist that that is not a coincidence (Sanders, 2015, para. 3). Mark Richards, Professor of Earth and Planetary Science at UC Berkely stated: If you try to explain why the largest impact we know of in the last billion years happened within 100,000 years of these massive lava flows at Deccan … the chances of that occurring at random are minuscule […] It’s not a very credible coincidence (as cited in Sanders, 2015, para. 3).  This is a strong defense in favor of volcanism; it is highly unlikely that the two events are completely coincidental. Many authors and scientists agree with this idea including Keller et al. (2009) who believe the volcanism theory is overlooked because of the popularity of the impact theory and the lack of evidence directly linking the mass extinction to Deccan volcanism (p. 709). One reason that some people have believed in the volcanism theory is that it answers some questions about the extinction that they think the impact theory cannot. For example, Cameron Tsujita (2001), author and paleontology professor, states that one problem that has been a point CONFLICTING THEORIES  7 of contention is the amounts of iridium found around the famous spike at the K-Pg boundary (p. 280). In his article, he speaks on behalf of both sides of the argument. He details that volcanism defenders have said that the vertical spread of the iridium tells us how long the activity of the Deccan traps lasted, therefore eliminating the need to suggest the impact event was the cause (p. 280). Conversely, for the impact theory, he states that scientists believe the lava from the eruptions of the Deccan traps would not have been able to produce the amount of iridium that is found around the large spike at the K-Pg boundary (p. 280). This statement completely negates the argument of the volcanism defenders, and if it is true, it also disproves it. The main reason that the theory of volcanism is not as accepted as the impact theory is that there are quite a few things that it cannot explain. Later in Tsujita’s (2001) article, he explains that the volcanic hypothesis cannot explain the instant (in geologic time) extinctions that occurred at the K-Pg boundary (p. 280), but Keller et al. (2009) declares that no species’ extinctions can be directly linked to the Chicxulub impact (p. 714). They state that this is true because when the effects the impact had on the environment were studied along the impact spherule layer, which is a layer that holds material after it is scattered from an asteroid impact, there were no outstanding changes in the frequency of any species appearances (p. 714). These differing opinions indicate incorrect evidence on one side, because both cannot be true. In the aforementioned re-analysis of evidence by a group of experts in 2010, it was discovered that while there was evidence of volcanic activity in India, there were no signs of the extinction period lasting for a long time as the Deccan volcanism hypothesis suggests (“Experts Reaffirm,” 2010, para. 10). They know this because there were no significant changes found in any ecosystems in the 500,000 years before the K-Pg boundary (para. 10). The scientists also found that, at the K-Pg boundary, there was suddenly a major decrease in the amount of living things CONFLICTING THEORIES  8 (para. 10), which was evidence of the asteroid suddenly striking the earth. Another factor in the volcanism hypothesis, much like the proposed effects of the impact, involves a release of gasses into the atmosphere that would have deadly environmental effects, but the experts also proved that that could not have happened. While large amounts of sulfur were released by the volcanic eruptions into the stratosphere, they would not have had the lasting effect to cause any significant damage (para. 11). On the other hand, the impact from the asteroid would have produced much larger amounts of sulfur and dust in a shorter time that lead to the world-wide dust cloud (para. 11). All of those discoveries led the experts to determine that the cause of the K-Pg extinction could not have been volcanism, and instead had to be the asteroid impact. Conclusion  The debate between the impact and volcanism theories is a perfect example of people sometimes not letting go of past ideas. Most of the evidence points toward the impact theory being correct, with more and more evidence being found to further prove it. When Alvarez published his findings in 1980, he faced backlash from some scientists because they were very used to the idea that the K-Pg extinction was caused by volcanism (Yarris, 2010, para. 8). This is interesting because even after 38 years, some people are still unwilling to let go, even though they no longer have much of a leg to stand on.

invasional meltdown hypothesis,102595124,4 Some Remarks on Melting and Extreme Metamorphism of Crustal Rocks,,"Michael Brown, Fawna J Korhonen, Michael Brown, Fawna J. Korhonen",2015,"Abstract: Typically melting occurs during decompression in ultra-high-pressure terranes, along the evolution from peak pressure to peak temperature in medium-temperature eclogite-high-pressure granulite terranes and by simple prograde heating in granulite facies and ultra-high-temperature (UHT) metamorphic terranes. The source of heat must be due to one or more processes among thickening and radiogenic heating, viscous dissipation, and heat from asthenospheric mantle. Melt-bearing rocks become porous at a few vol % melt initiating an advective flow regime. As the melt volume approaches and exceeds the melt connectivity transition ( ~ 7 vol % melt), melt may be lost from the system in the first of several melt-loss events. In migmatites and residual granulites, a variety of microstructures indicates the for-mer presence of melt at the grain scale and leucosome networks at outcrop scale record melt extraction pathways. This evidence supports a model of focused melt flow by dilatant shear failure at low melt volume as the crust weakens with increasing melt production. Melt ascent is initiated as ductile fractures but continues in dykes that propagate as brittle fractures. Crustal rocks undergo melting via a sequence of reactions beginning with minimal melt pro-duction at the wet solidus (generally &lt; 1 vol % melt, unless there is influx of H2O-rich fluid)",,text,,,

In this work we study the first steps of the post-impact evolution of the lunar mantle and crust by modeling impact melting, melt pool formation and differentiation and their contribution to the development of the lunar dichotomy.    Using the iSALE code, we modeled the impact of a 800km sized projectile onto the Procellarum region on the lunar nearside. Based on the pressure and temperature conditions predicted by the impact model, solidus and liquidus curves and compositional partial melting models for target and projectile materials we calculated the volumes and compositions of local partial melts, that ascend to form a melt pool in the impact region.    We used alphaMELTS to model fractional crystallization of the melt pool, the formation of a secondary crust by plagioclase floatation and the subsidence of the Procellarum region resulting from melt pool solidification. In addition we determined the duration of melt pool crystallization, considering melt pool convection and heat conduction through a growing crust.    We found that partial melting and melt pool formation lead to a local enrichment of the upper mantle in incompatible elements (e.g. K, REE, P, Fe, Ti, Th), potentially explaining the compositional anomaly in the Procellarum region.

IntroductionThickened orogenic crust is found to be or have been in a partially molten state in modern (Nelson et al., 1996;Schilling et al., 1997) and in past orogenies (Brown, 2001; Vanderhaeghe & Teyssier, 2001). Partial melting ofthe lower crust during the evolution of an orogen produces granite-migmatite belts that have been generallyattributed to either (a) thickening of the crust during orogenesis and associated increase in the radiogenicheating raising the geotherm enough for crustal anatexis (Bea, 2012; Thompson & Connolly, 1995) or (b) athermal pulse from the mantle, induced by slab break-off (Davies & von Blanckenburg, 1995) or convectivethinning, delamination, or foundering of the thickened lithospheric mantle (Bonin, 2004; Platt & England,1994; Sylvester, 1998; Yuen & Fleitout, 1985).To reach high enough temperatures for anatexis by crustal thickening only, twice the original crustal thick-ness is needed (Bea, 2012; Thompson & Connolly, 1995). This mechanism is especially problematic in regionswhere syncollisional high-temperature/low-pressure metamorphism points to only modest crustal thickening(Finger et al., 2009; Franke, 2000). Therefore, a nonnegligible mantle contribution to the increased tempera-tures is often necessary to explain the formation of widespread crustal melting. This mantle contribution inthe generation of the granite-migmatite belts is supported by the presence of primitive (ultra)potassic mag-mas, either as intrusive bodies or as a ubiquitous component of the granitoids (e.g., Couzinié et al., 2014, 2016;Ledru et al., 2001; Väisänen et al., 2000). Based on their geochemistry, the mantle-derived magmas are inter-preted to originate from a hydrous metasomatic mantle (Bonin, 2004; Murphy, 2013; Turner et al., 1996), andtheir underplating at the crust-mantle transition zone (CMTZ; e.g., Williamson et al., 1992) would promotecrustal melting through heat advection (Petford & Gallagher, 2001).Cessation of the tectonic compression and a sudden change in the gravitational potential energy by founder-ing of the lithospheric mantle and subsequent dynamic uplift are thought to cause orogenic collapse at thelater stages of the orogeny (Dewey, 1988). Collapse (synconvergent extension) is even possible with con-tinuing tectonic convergence and compression, since crustal melting causes rheological weakening of thelower to middle crust (Gray & Pysklywec, 2012; Vanderhaeghe & Teyssier, 2001).

Rapid exhumation might also enhance the melting as pressure decreases (Teyssier &Whitney, 2002).A rheologically weak layer at or near the CMTZ has also been recognized as an important feature and a pre-requisite for mantle delamination (Bird, 1979; Meissner & Mooney, 1998). Usually, this decoupling is thoughtto arise from the rheological layering of the lithosphere, where the lower crust is inherently weaker than theunderlying lithospheric mantle, decoupling these two from each other, and allowing the negatively buoyantlithospheric mantle to sink into the asthenosphere. Even small melt fractions can significantly weaken crustalrocks (e.g., Rosenberg & Handy, 2005), suggesting that, if present near or at the CMTZ, partial melting couldalso cause such a weak layer, too.Numerical and conceptual models of both crustal collapse (e.g., Jamieson et al., 2004; Liu & Yang, 2003; Reyet al., 2010; Teyssier & Whitney, 2002) and foundering of lithospheric mantle (e.g., Chung et al., 2003; Göğüş &Pysklywec, 2008; Göğüş et al., 2017; Nelson, 1992) are numerous, but the interaction of these two processeshas gained less attention. In many models of crustal collapse the focus lies in the exhumation and extension ofthe crust, and thus, the lower boundary of the model is the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, which doesnot give the mantle convection an active role or allow for dynamic mass transfer between lithosphere andasthenosphere. With the exception of few (e.g., Ueda et al., 2012) models of lithospheric foundering, crustalprocesses do not possess an active and evolving role but are only passively responding to mantle processes,for example, melting, extension, and collapse after removal of the lithospheric mantle. Numerical models ofother geological settings (e.g., Gerya & Meilick, 2011) that incorporate dynamic melting models have shownthe importance of rheological weakening by fluids and melts to the overall dynamics of the system.Widespread crustal anatexis in synorogenic to postorogenic processes, that is, formation of thegranite-migmatite belts, is important not only for the crustal collapse and extension but also for the under-lying mantle lithosphere dynamics: Melt-induced weakening in the lower crust could drive the crust-mantledecoupling even further and can trigger wholesale, catastrophic mantle lithosphere removal and thus strongasthenospheric upwelling. For example Göğüş and Pysklywec (2008) have shown that this would happenin the presence of an explicitly imposed weak layer. Here we propose and test a more dynamic hypothesis,in which partial melting and layer decoupling reinforce each other. For this purpose, we present numericalmodels of convectively thinning postcollisional lithosphere, integrated with melting models for both mantleand crustal melts, and melt-induced rheological weakening. We use these models to show that crustal andmantle processes interact in a fundamental way, where not only the processes taking place in the mantleaffect generation of granite-migmatite belts but also the anatexis within the crust can change the evolutionof the whole lithosphere.2. MethodsWe study the convection and melting of the mantle and crust in a syncollisional to postcollisional settingwhere the mantle rocks are overlain by a moderately thickened crust. Our models assume a metasomatic man-tle which has been hydrated by a previous subduction system and where water is accommodated by bothnominally anhydrous phases and hydrous phases. Water in nominally anhydrous mantle phases decreasestheir viscosity (e.g., Mei & Kohlstedt, 2000)—and consequently the upper mantle viscosity—enhances sub-lithospheric convection and leads to localized thinning of the mantle lithosphere. Melting in the crust and inthe mantle is dynamically coupled to the convecting mantle, and feedback effects by consumption of latentheat and changes in the rock composition and physical parameters (viscosity and density) are taken intoaccount.2.1. Mantle Convection ModelWe solve the equations for conservation of mass, momentum, and energy with a finite element code Citcom(Moresi & Gurnis, 1996; Zhong et al., 2000) to model the mantle convection in a 2-D model domain with dimen-sions of 660 km × 2,640 km and grid resolution of 64 × 256 elements. Adiabatic heating, shear heating, andheating by radioactive elements are taken into account (extended Boussinesq approximation; Christensen &Yuen, 1985). A linear temperature, pressure, and water content-dependent rheology is used, similar to the oneKAISLANIEMI ET AL. 3103Tectonics 10.1029/2018TC005014Table 1Values of Physical Parameters Used in the ModelsParameter Symbol (unit) Value usedActivation energy E (J/mol) 1.2 × 105Activation volume V (m3/mol) 6 × 10−6Radiogenic heating Q (W/kg) 19 × 10−12Thermal diffusivity 𝜅 (m2/s) 10−6Heat capacity Cp (J⋅kg−1⋅K−1) 1, 250Reference temperature T0,abs (K) 1, 623Reference pressure P0 (Pa) 21.4 × 109Reference viscosity 𝜂0 (Pa s) 1022Effective visc.

See Table 1 and Figure 1 for other parameters and their values. Linearrheology with low thermal activation energy has been shown (van Hunenet al., 2005) to produce similar thermal boundary layer dynamics than anon-linear rheology (n = 3.5) with an activation energy in the range of 360to 540 kJ/mol. We therefore use this parameterization instead of nonlinearrheology, which is numerically more challenging to solve.Melt weakening of the rock, caused by unextracted partial melts occupyinggrain boundaries, is parameterized with a relation?̇?(𝜙)?̇?(0)= exp (𝛽𝜙) (2)(Mei et al., 2002), where ?̇? is the strain rate, 𝜙 is the melt fraction, and 𝛽 ≈ 26 in the diffusion creep regime.With a linear rheology, this converts to𝜂𝜙 = exp (−𝛽𝜙) (3)Melt weakening is limited by the forced lower limit for the viscosity (see Table 1).For the lithospheric structure, we use the so called jelly sandwich rheology model (Burov & Watts, 2006) wherethe base of the crust is significantly weaker than the lithospheric mantle (Kohlstedt et al., 1995; Ranalli &Murphy, 1987; Wang et al., 2012). This provides a possible zone for the decoupling of crust and lithosphericmantle. The cause of this weak layer is the thermally activated creep of the wet quartz and feldspars below thebrittle/ductile transition depth (Rybacki et al., 2006). The extent of this weakening, however, has been sub-ject to debate (Jackson, 2002). We simplify the rheological model by using the same diffusion creep rheologyfor both the crust and the mantle and lowering the effective viscosity of the crust by 2 orders of magnitude.Together with the temperature-dependent viscosity this leads to an effective viscosity profile where there isa weak layer in the transition from mantle to lower crust but then at the shallower (i.e., cooler) depths thestrength of the lithosphere quickly increases again.A marker-in-cell method (Gerya & Yuen, 2003) is used to carry and advect temperature and lithologicalinformation. There are on average 40 markers per grid element, of which 50% carry the rock compositioninformation for melting models, and all markers are used for temperature advection. Each marker representsa constant volume fraction of a grid element.Figure 1. Model setup (not to scale). Brown/gray colors: crust; red colors: mantle.

Melting ModelsThe models consider the melting of crustal and mantle rocks. For the mantle rocks, we use a parameterizedmelting model of hydrous peridotite by Katz et al. (2003). For crustal rocks, we calculate the liquidus and theamount of melt via a Gibbs free energy minimization strategy with PerpleX (Connolly, 2005; 2009). This permitsa dynamic integration of the melting models so that the solidus of the crustal lithology depends on its fertilitythrough its composition and melt depletion.The parameterized melting model of the mantle rocks gives the amount of melt produced and the watercontent of the melt given the pressure, temperature, and water content of the bulk rock (a peridotite). Thisis used in the convection model to (1) modify the residual water content with bulk partitioning coefficientDH2O = 0.01 as used by Katz et al. (2003); (2) modify the rocks’ effective mantle viscosity due to melt weakeningand amount of water present, according to equation (1); (3) calculate the amount of latent heat consumed inthe melting; and (4) modify the density of the residue. The density 𝜌 of lherzolite reduces with depletion F%,following the relationdln𝜌dF%= −0.00020 (4)which is applicable at approximately 3 GPa (Schutt & Lesher, 2006). Here F% = 100F, where F is the depletionparameter, that is, the fraction of total extracted melt from the bulk rock.PerpleX performs Gibbs energy minimization for a given crustal rock composition, carried within the lithologyinformation of the markers. Input parameters are the amounts of major elements (in this case in NCKFMASHT:Na2O, CaO, K2O, FeOT, MgO, Al2O3, SiO2, H2O, and TiO2), pressure, temperature, and the thermodynamic datalibraries for the minerals and the solid solutions. We use the thermodynamic data from Holland and Powell(1998, revised in 2004), and their solid solutions (for garnet, pyroxenes, olivine, spinel, biotite, mica, chlorite,and chloritoid), except for amphibole (Wei & Powell, 2003; White et al., 2003), feldspars (Fuhrman & Lindsley,1988), melt (White et al., 2001)—with modified pressure dependency of a sillimanite liquid from Bouilholet al. (2015)—and the equation of state of water from Holland and Powell (1991). Results from the Gibbsenergy minimization include the amount and composition of the stable phases (i.e., of minerals and liquidphases). This information is used (1) to modify the residue composition (all nine major oxides), which thenaffects subsequent melt processes, and (2) to calculate the consumption of latent heat in the melting. PerpleXresults are tabulated prior to model run for unmodified rock compositions and recalculated each time stepfor modified rock compositions that are not available within the lookup table.Depending on model parameters (Table 2), melts are extracted in some models and left in place in other mod-els. Where melts are removed, the properties of the melt-depleted residue are updated with the informationfrom the melting models, as described above. If melts are retained, the amount of melting is only recordedbut the chemical properties of the bulk rock are not changed (i.e., the melt is assumed to stay in equilibriumwith the rock and the latent heat of melting is still available for the rock during subsequent time steps).Where crustal melts are extracted the melt (mass and latent heat) is removed from the model domain andits amount recorded. Where mantle melts are extracted they are assumed to advect upward and immedi-ately underplate the crust at the CMTZ. Only the thermal effect of the underplating is taken into account: thesensible and latent heat of the melts is removed from the source regions and used to increase the tempera-ture between z = 41 km and z = 52 km, that is, distributed within the markers inside the grid element thatencloses the CMTZ.Crustal melts are only extracted if the amount of partial melt exceeds the removal threshold. The used valueof 8% for crustal melts represents a liquid percolation threshold (Vigneresse et al., 1996) at which point meltKAISLANIEMI ET AL. 3105Tectonics 10.1029/2018TC005014pockets become connected. Once this threshold is exceeded, all melts are removed. No threshold is imposedfor mantle melts; the low viscosity of mantle melts and the high strain rates caused by the sublithosphericsmall-scale convection (SSC) are assumed to effectively extract mantle melts by stress-driven melt segregation(Kohlstedt & Holtzman, 2009). See section 4 about the effect of these thresholds for the model behavior.2.3. Model SetupFigure 1 shows the model setup. An upper mantle model domain with aspect ratio 4 (2,640 × 660 km) iscreated, in which a thickened crust (45 km) and a total (chemical) lithosphere thickness of 90 km representthe structure of the lithosphere after collision and subsequent rethinning of the lithosphere. The tempera-ture is 0 ∘C at the surface and fixed at 1690 ∘C (potential temperature 1360 ∘C) at the bottom, with zero heatflow at the lateral boundaries. The bottom boundary condition temperature is chosen so that the poten-tial temperature of the convecting mantle is at a realistic level (1330 ± 10 ∘C). Internal radiogenic heatingis constant throughout the model domain and is increased by a factor of 3 compared to real mantle values(cf. Kaislaniemi & van Hunen, 2014). This is done to replace bottom heating by a similar amount of internalheating. This replacement therefore maintains a similar thermal evolution, while suppressing the generationof plume-like upwellings that would be caused by mainly bottom-heated models and that would increasethe complexity of the models and, in some cases, would help destabilize the lithospheric mantle. It is likelythat the high-viscosity lower mantle helps anchor plumes in one place (Lowman & Gable, 2008). Our modelsare restricted to the upper mantle only, and thus, other measures are needed to suppress the appearance ofplumes. We limit the applicability of our models to environments where plume interaction with the orogeniclithosphere is likely to have been absent. All boundaries have a free-slip velocity boundary condition. The ini-tial density structure (Figure 1) takes into account the upper and lower crust and the lithospheric mantle witha small inherent compositional, depleted-related buoyancy compared to the sublithospheric mantle.All models are started from an initial premelt model where the thermal lithosphere thickness has reached astatistical steady state, so that the 1250 ∘C isotherm has located at z =90 km for about 40 Myr. These initialmodels are run using the model setup from Figure 1 and parameters from the reference model (M000, Table 2),with all melting disabled. Once the steady state is reached, melt calculations and parameters according toTable 2 are switched on. In the results shown, this moment has a model time of 0 Myr and is common for allthe models.The water content of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle in postcollisional areas is not well constrained,but several lines of evidence suggest that it is enriched is volatile elements, and especially water. Such enrich-ment is clearly inherited from the subduction system that preceded collision (e.g., Prelević et al., 2013). Anominally anhydrous mantle contains up to 200-ppm H2O (Hirschmann, 2006), and in several places xenolithsshow widespread and heterogeneous evidence of metasomatism inherited from subduction. The metaso-matic character of the mantle is demonstrated by the presence of phlogopite and/or amphibole in mantlexenoliths present in high-K postcollisional mantle melts (e.g., in Tibet; ; Liu et al., 2011) or in recent volcaniccenters sampling postorogenic mantle (e.g., in the Massif-Central; ; Lenoir et al., 2000). Although heteroge-neously distributed, hydrous phases can amount to as much as 5 wt %, thus making up to 2,000 ppm of H2Oin a phlogopite-bearing mantle. Our models use a value of 400 ppm of H2O for the mantle, a value abovethe nominally anhydrous mantle, representing a reasonable estimate of a metasomatic mantle (containing∼ 2wt% of amphibole or ∼ 1wt% of phlogopite). This hydrous mantle represents conditions in a postcolli-sional setting where previous subduction has been hydrating the overlying lithospheric mantle and leads torelatively strong localized intermittent and temporary thinning of the lithosphere is, in itself, not enough todestabilize the whole lithospheric mantle (i.e., the average thickness of the thermal lithosphere is constantand reached in the initial premelt model calculations).For the initial crustal rock composition, we use a global estimate from Rudnick and Fountain (1995) for a gen-eral average lower crust composition of platform and shield areas (SiO2: 52.4; MgO: 7.1; CaO: 9.5; Al2O3: 16.5;Na2O: 2.7; K2O: 0.6; FeOT: 8.2; TiO2: 0.8 wt %) with a water content of 1.5 wt %.To test the effects of partial lower crust and mantle melting to the lithosphere stability, we have run the modelswith varying controlling parameters (Table 2).KAISLANIEMI ET AL. 3106Tectonics 10.1029/2018TC005014Figure 2. A view on the sublithospheric small-scale convection in early stages of model calculation. Black solid lines arethe lithosphere isotherms, black-to-gray lines with arrows describe the velocity field (darker color means highervelocities; maximum velocity is 25mm/year), and the red solid line is the previous location of the 1250 ∘C isotherm,5 Myr earlier. High water content, compared to dry mantle, lowers viscosity, enhances convection, and causes the size ofthe convection cells to decrease to about 100–300 km in diameter. This enhanced convection heats the lithospheremore effectively from below and erodes the bottom of the lithosphere, causing some locations (e.g., A) to have locallydecreasing lithosphere thickness, but other locations to increase in lithosphere thickness (e.g., B). The locations ofthickened and thinned lithosphere vary in time, so that small-scale convection alone does not lead to removal of thewhole lithospheric mantle but instead a thinned (heated) lithosphere is rethickened (cooled) later, and the averagelithosphere thickness reaches a steady state value (approximately 100 km in the models here). Some asthenosphericmelts may appear temporarily in places where lithosphere is thinned (crosses near A and C; cf. Kaislaniemi et al., 2014).Horizontal average of the effective viscosity is shown on the right.3. ResultsA complex interplay between melt weakening, depletion stiffening, and chemical depletion can be observedin the models (Figure 2). The model setup in the initial premelt model leads to a (statistical) steady state wherethe lithosphere thickness is locally and temporally thinned and then thickened again. The locations of thesethinned and thickened regions vary through time. This is caused by the sublithospheric SSC that is enhancedby the elevated water concentrations in the mantle.After this initial premelt model, the behavior of the models depends on the used parameters (Table 2). Inreference model M000, melt amounts are calculated but do not affect the flow (Figures 3a–3d): melt does notweaken the material and is not extracted. This model continues to produce SSC, and the average lithospherethickness does not change. Partial melting takes place in the lowermost crust, with increased degree abovelocally thinned lithosphere. At the same time, some asthenospheric melts are produced by decompressionmelting below the thinned locations. As the melts are not removed, they will solidify once the SSC patternchanges and lowers the geotherm again.In models where melt weakening is enabled (M1xx), partial crustal and asthenospheric melting leads to adecrease in the viscosity. This weakening produces a positive feedback (Figures 3e–3h) where melt weakeningsustains further thinning of the lithosphere—leading to complete removal of the lithospheric mantle—andthus also higher total amounts of both crustal and mantle melts as compared to model M000. Such completeremoval of the lithospheric mantle takes place as dripping of the lithosphere into the asthenosphere and ismore akin to (fast) convective thinning, or foundering as drips, than to delamination as one coherent layer(Bird, 1979).The removal of the lithospheric mantle in model M100 (Figures 3e–3h) takes approximately 20 Myr, changingfrom almost intact mantle lithosphere at about 50-Myr model time to completely absent mantle lithosphere,spanning 200 km horizontally, at 70 Myr. The timing and location of this event is, to some extent, random:it is triggered by the SSC, which itself is chaotic in a sense that the convection cells that locally thicken andthin the lithosphere move horizontally in a random pattern. Whenever the lithosphere happens to be thinnedstrongly enough for long enough time to raise the geotherm at lower crustal levels, the complete, catastrophic,foundering of mantle lithosphere can start. Despite the randomness caused by SSC, the overall convectivethinning of the lithosphere has a systematic control on timing and location of the full mantle lithosphereremoval: once the global lithosphere thickness has decreased to level that small local perturbations start toaffect crustal temperatures, complete foundering has a chance to start.3.1. Mantle InputWhen underplating of mantle melts at CMTZ is enabled in the models (M110, Figure 4), this is found to initiallyincrease the crustal melting rate, but to decrease the total amount of crustal melting. This is caused by changesKAISLANIEMI ET AL. 3107Tectonics 10.1029/2018TC005014Figure 3. Comparison of models with melt weakening effects disabled (a–d, model M000) and enabled (e–h, model M100). Background colors describe thetemperature field. Red dots indicate markers of crustal lithology with more than zero partial melt. Melt weakening (e–h) leads to positive feedback and enhancedlithospheric thinning (f ) and eventually to complete removal of the lithospheric mantle (g, h). White contour shows the crust-mantle transition zone, thelithological boundary between crust and mantle. Black contours show degree of mantle melting (1%, 3%, and 5%). Velocity arrows scale with the axes (km/Myr).in the melt source regions: Once the mantle melts are extracted and advected to the CMTZ, the residue leftin the mantle is low in water content, since most of the water was partitioned in the melt. This melt-depletedmantle has a higher viscosity than the fertile mantle. At the same time, the weakening of the residue causedby the presence of melts disappears (as the melts are drained away). Removing water from the mantle rockalso makes it more refractory and production of further mantle melts is hindered. Additionally, the depletedperidotite is less dense than fertile peridotite. All these effects accumulate to cause the mantle source regionfor the underplating melts to become a layer of high-viscosity, buoyant and refractory material. This stops thethinning of the lithosphere and shields the crust and remaining lithospheric mantle from the hot convectingmantle below. The foundering ends and the lithosphere starts to cool and thicken again, so that the layer ofdepleted mantle material becomes part of the stable lithosphere.If there is no underplating of the mantle melts at the CMTZ but melts are left in their place within the mantle(M100), the viscosity remains low because of the melt weakening effect of the melts. Initial amounts of crustalmelting are not increased by the advection of heat from the melts. However, the foundering is driven furtherby the presence of the low-viscosity mantle melts and will spread horizontally to span more than 400 km.Additionally, the lithosphere regains its thickness very slowly, extending the time the lower crust is exposedto the hot convecting mantle. This leads to prolonged times of crustal melting. Extraction of the crustal melts(in M111) has a similar negative feedback effect on any further crustal melting, because melt removal leavesa residue that is more refractory in composition (Figures 5d and 5e).3.2. Melt ProductionThe models where melt weakening is enabled, and most of the mantle lithosphere is removed, show a charac-teristic pattern of melt production. In model M111, where both crustal and mantle melts are extracted, minorKAISLANIEMI ET AL. 3108Tectonics 10.1029/2018TC005014Figure 4. In models where mantle melts are extracted and underplate the crust at crust-mantle transition zone (model M110, a–c) a high-viscosity buoyantresidue layer is formed underneath the crust (blue contours, 1%, 3%, and 5% melt depletion). This protects the lithosphere from further thinning and allows it tocool back to its original thickness (c). If mantle melts are not extracted (model M100, d–f ) foundering of the lithospheric mantle continues longer and extendsover broader region. Plot of horizontally averaged crustal melt amount across section x = 1,000–1,600 km (g) shows that underplating initially promotes crustalmelting (green line) but eventually slows down as compared to without underplating (blue line). Note that the decrease in the melt amount is possible since thecrustal melts are not extracted and may thus recrystallize. Velocity arrows scale with the axes (km/Myr).amounts of partial melts, that is, summed layer thickness up to maximum of 500 m, exist in the lowermostcrust before the lithospheric mantle is foundered into the asthenosphere (Figures 5a and 5d). The degree ofmelting is initially not large enough to extract any melt (Figure 5b, before 25 Myr). As the SSC produces alocally thinned region of lithosphere, the hot convecting mantle moves closer to the lowermost crust, pro-ducing more crustal melts. This initiates the discussed positive feedback mechanism, as seen in model M100,leading to further thinning and melting. The degree of crustal melts exceeds the liquid percolation thresh-old and the crustal melts can be extracted (Figure 5b, after 25 Myr). Once the crustal melts are extracted, therefractory residue does not melt further, and the production of crustal melts slowly disappears. The convect-ing mantle, however, still drags pieces of crust horizontally and then down deeper into the mantle, formingtracks of crustal melting taking place at the boundaries of the extremely thin mantle lithosphere, spreadinghorizontally as the region of foundering lithosphere expands.At the culmination of the mantle lithosphere removal, when the hot convecting mantle comes in directcontact with the crust, there is a single pulse of crustal melting and melt extraction (Figure 5b, at 50 Myr,x = 1,350 km), lasting 5 to 10 Myr. Shortly prior to this, at ∼ 43 Myr, a strong pulse of mantle melting com-mences. This pulse of mantle melts, although fading, continues for up to 30 Myr, since the convection canreplace some of the depleted mantle with fertile material from below.KAISLANIEMI ET AL. 3109Tectonics 10.1029/2018TC005014Figure 5.

DiscussionOur results indicate significant interactions between mantle and crustal processes as the destabilization ofthe orogenic lithosphere proceeds. We show how sublithospheric SSC increases mantle heat flow into thelower crust enough to trigger minor crustal anatexis which may, via positive feedback effects, result in catas-trophic foundering of the whole mantle lithosphere into the asthenosphere. A prerequisite for this to happenis a lithosphere that has reached close its original thickness after collision, and a moderately elevated watercontents in the upper mantle.From these results, we can better understand the formation of granite-migmatite belts in the frame of post-collisional settings and propose a model that characterizes the roles of the mantle and the crust: Convectivethinning of the orogenic thickened lithosphere brings the lithosphere closer to its original thickness. Thermalrelaxation and subsequent increased basalt heat flow by the sublithospheric SSC leads to higher tempera-tures in the crust and uppermost lithospheric mantle, as well, and increases temperatures above the solidusat the lower level of the thickened crust, starting the formation of migmatites. These partial melts in the lowercrust may exist for prolonged times. The nature of the SSC causes variation in the degree of melting, and therheological weakening by the partial melts can trigger foundering of the whole lithospheric mantle in placeswhere amount of partial melts is high enough. The water initially introduced by subduction into the overrid-ing plate through metasomatism allows the initiation of SSC, and (conceptually) also added to the convectivethinning prior to its initiation.KAISLANIEMI ET AL. 3110Tectonics 10.1029/2018TC005014Removal of the mantle lithosphere leads to strong asthenospheric upwelling and extensive melting bydecompression where the lithosphere is thinnest. Within about 20–30 Myr the lower crust is exposed to theasthenosphere over a distance of a few hundred kilometers. There is a significant increase in the lower crustalmelting. This pulse of crustal melt formation continues for about 5–10 Myr. The degree of melting in the crustrises above the critical threshold of melt extraction, which would ultimately trigger the formation of graniticplutons in higher crustal levels. This process can explain the generation of postcollisional granite-migmatitezones showing long-lived anatectic crust followed by extensive melt extraction and emplacement associatedwith mantle-derived magmatism. The crustal melting stops rather abruptly, and the mantle-derived magma-tism slowly wanes as the lithosphere grows back to its steady state thickness. As a result of this whole process,mantle melts are temporally related to crustal melting but have different spatial distribution (cf. Figures 5band 5c).4.1. Relation to Observed Late-Orogenic MagmatismThis scenario fits the temporal and petrogenetic relations between the migmatites, granitic plutons, and maficbodies produced at late stages of many orogenic collisions. The granitic suites (Bonin, 2004) of crustal originare typically associated with postcollisional mafic magmas that are rich in both compatible (Mg, Fe, Ni, andCr) and incompatible elements (K2O, high-field-strength elements, and light rare-earth elements; e.g., Castroet al., 2003; Fowler, 1988; Fowler & Rollinson, 2012; Graessner et al., 2000; Kotkova et al., 2010; Molina et al.,2012; Murphy, 2013). They are most often deduced to have their sources in the lithospheric mantle that hasbeen enriched by incompatible crustal components during the subduction. These postcollisional mafic mag-mas are coeval or slightly predate the granitic plutonism, both of which, in turn, postdate crustal anatexis ofvariable durations (in some cases with considerable overlap). This is the case, for example, in the CanadianCordillera (Gordon et al., 2008) with 20 Myr of progressive gneiss-migmatite formation ending in a short pulseof leucogranite plutonism; in the Proterozoic Svecofennian orogeny (Väisänen et al., 2000) where shoshoniticmantle melts intervene the granite-migmatite belt formation over 20 Myrs; in the Variscan orogeny in centralSpain (Montero et al., 2004) and in Calabria (Graessner et al., 2000); and, as a well studied example, the Velaydome region of the eastern French Massif Central (Couzinié et al., 2014; Laurent et al., 2017).The Velay dome granite-migmatite complex is one of the best studied examples of a large-scale anatectic sys-tem that developed in a late orogenic stage. It hosts abundant and diverse granitoid rocks that have beenemplaced at the end of the collision and throughout the late-orogenic collapse. These granitoids are formedin two stages (Laurent et al., 2017): (1) metamorphism and limited, water-present partial melting during340–314 Ma, and (2) high-temperature, extensive biotite breakdown melting at 310–300 Ma, finally leadingto the collapse and formation of the Velay dome itself at 305–300 Ma. These granitoids are sourced from theorthogneisses and paragneisses of the local orogenic crust and have been measured with P-T conditions of5–6 kbar, 720–750 ∘C, and 4–5 kbar, 750–850 ∘C, for the two stages, respectively (Barbey et al., 1999; Bouilholet al., 2006; Couzinié et al., 2014; Montel et al., 1992; Mougeot et al., 1996). Volumetrically minor enclaves ofgabbroic to dioritic rocks, vaugnerites, are ubiquitously hosted within the granitoids. The vaugnerites havehigh-K to shoshonitic affinities and are rich in incompatible trace elements, taken as evidence for havingtheir source in the metasomatized lithospheric mantle (Couzinié et al., 2016). The vaugnerites are generatedthroughout the 340–300 Ma period but seem to have a peak in their generation rate at circa 315–305 Ma(Couzinié et al., 2014; Laurent et al., 2017), slightly before the collapse and formation of the Velay dome. The40 Myr period of sustained high heat flux and crustal anatexis requires a long-lived thermal anomaly, and,also, a mechanism to explain the incubation period of 340–310 Ma before the more extensive melt produc-tion commences. The apparent lack of orogenic root underneath the eastern French Massif Central (Averbuch& Piromallo, 2012) suggests that removal of the lithospheric mantle after the collision could have contributedthis extra heating. We suggest that our model presented above provides the mechanism for this mantle litho-sphere removal and explains the spatiotemporal relations of the mantle and crustal melts in the Velay domegranite-migmatite complex. The mantle melts of our models represent the vaugnerite magmatism, and thelower crustal melts directly and indirectly, via advective heating, contribute to the granitic magmatism andincreased geotherm at the upper crustal levels.Our model agrees well with the above-mentioned observations from the Velay dome region of the Variscanorogeny but could be more generally applied to other orogenies that show marks of orogenic collapse, as well.The new model for the formation of orogenic granite-migmatite belts presented here shows the importanceof the interaction between mantle and crustal processes and suggests less straightforward cause-and-effectrelationships than existing conceptual models: the asthenospheric upwelling associated with the orogenicKAISLANIEMI ET AL. 3111Tectonics 10.1029/2018TC005014collapse is not a passive upwelling caused by the lithospheric extension, nor does it need to be the primaryinitiator of the high-temperature metamorphism of the lower crust, as commonly suggested (e.g., Liu & Shen,1998; Sonder & Jones, 1999). Instead, in our models, such upwelling postdates the beginning of the crustalanatexis that is initiated by convective downwellings that thin the lithosphere by SSC and plays an importantrole only once the lower crust is sufficiently weakened by the partial melts. Though dating of these progrademetamorphic events from the geological record might prove difficult for geochronology, we note that themantle-derived magmatism intervening crustal plutonism requires some concurrency of mantle and crustalmelt extraction. This requirement is fulfilled in the described model. Dome-like structures at the bottom ofthe crust can be formed after the foundering of the lithospheric mantle (cf. Figure 5e) causing lateral variationin the degree of partial melting within the crust.4.2. Feedback MechanismsThe extraction rates of mantle and crustal melts are critical for the positive feedback effect between melt weak-ening and lithosphere removal to work. If all crustal melts are extracted at the same rate as they form, therewill be no melt present in the lower crust to cause the rheological weakening, and thus, the positive feedbackeffect is disabled. Immediate extraction of mantle melts does not have an equally dramatic effect, althoughretention of mantle melts does favor stronger thinning of the lithosphere and more extensive lower crustmelting. Consequently, the process of granite-migmatite belt formation, mantle lithosphere detachment, andorogenic collapse can be brought to a halt by early melt extraction. Variations in melting history (fast/slowproduction of melts) and/or in melt extraction threshold values (lithology, deformation-enhanced extraction)could perhaps explain why some orogenies (e.g., Uralides and Trans-Hudson orogeny) have not experiencedorogenic collapse but instead have a structure of an arrested orogeny with relatively thick crust underlain bymechanically intact lithosphere (Artemieva & Mooney, 2001; Leech, 2001). Strength increase due to early meltextraction might provide a mechanism for stopping a self-sustaining delamination process also in other set-tings. Further studies are needed to resolve how sensitive the initiation and halting of full mantle lithosphereremoval is to melt extraction rates. Our models used melt percolation thresholds of 8% (for crustal rocks) and0/∞% (for mantle rocks). These values directly affect the melt extraction rates, and variation in these valuesis likely to affect the behavior of the models: Higher percolation thresholds will allow the mantle lithosphereremoval to progress further before melt removal slows down the process (cf. models M100 and M110).Underplating of mafic magmas from the mantle at the CMTZ has been suggested to promote crustal melt-ing (Annen & Sparks, 2002; Laube & Springer, 1998; Petford & Gallagher, 2001). However, in order to produceobserved melt volumes within the crust, enough heat must be transferred from the mantle. This requires semi-continuous or periodic underplating of mantle melts. Our results indicate that this supply is dependent on theprocesses that take place at the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary. Advection of underplating magmasleaves behind a residue that diminishes further supply of melts. This process is sensitive to the amount of waterin the mantle: high water content causes more extensive mantle melting, and thus higher amounts of under-plating and crustal melting, and also stronger contrasts in viscosity and buoyancy between the fertile mantleand the depleted mantle. The shielding layer of this depleted mantle will be more effective in this case andwill prevent further mantle melting and underplating efficiently. Our parameterization of density decrease asa function of melt depletion follows Schutt and Lesher (2006) who considered dry phases. If removal of lighthydrous phases (mica and amphibole) from the residue would lead to its density increase instead, this wouldlead to less buoyant layer of depleted shield, and possible faster or more extensive removal of the lithosphericmantle. The depleted shielding layer is likely to form, anyway, at some later point, after the consumption ofhydrous phases from the source.Our models show that purely mantle-dominated processes can cause crustal anatexis assuming postcolli-sional SSC at the asthenosphere-lithosphere boundary and the positive feedback between mantle/crustalmelting and further lithosphere thinning by melt weakening. Other processes suggested to be the heat sourcefor granite-migmatite belt formation, such as increased radiogenic heating in the thickened crust, are notnecessary. Should they take place, however, their effect would promote the crustal melting but would notremove the positive feedback effect between melting and lithosphere thinning observed in our models. Forexample, Maierová et al. (2016) used crustal scale numerical models to study the gravitational overturn ofthe thickened orogenic crust in hot, large orogens, such as the European Variscides, with a relaminated fel-sic lower crust. They showed that the gravity overturn happens even with minor gravity inversion in the crustand that the consequent exhumation of the lower crust is enhanced by rheological weakening due to partialmelting. Our models have significantly less detailed description of the crust, but these results can be seen asKAISLANIEMI ET AL. 3112Tectonics 10.1029/2018TC005014complementary to each other: The mantle processes described here provide additional heat for the melt-ing of the (lower) crust, and buoyancy-driven exchanges within the crust described by Maierová et al. (2016)form the final crustal structure of the orogen with the heterogeneous, partially molten, middle crust and itspolyphase tectonic history. Similarly, even though a postcollisional slab break-off at shallow level could be apotential cause for increased basal heating of the crust, our results show that it is not necessary to explain thecrustal anatexis and mafic magmatism.5. ConclusionsWe have investigated numerically the sensitivity of lithosphere stability to melt-induced weakening in apostcollisional lithosphere. Our models show that partial melting of the lowermost crust—caused by theincreased geotherm by convective thinning of the lithosphere and sublithospheric SSC underneath it—canlead to positive feedback by melt weakening and to the foundering of the whole lithospheric mantle in to theasthenosphere, leading to mantle- and crust-derived late-orogenic magmatic activity.This process explains the generation of those granite-migmatite zones that show long-lived partial meltingof the crust followed by extensive plutonism and intervening mantle-derived magmatism. Furthermore, itprovides an explanation for the observed relationships between asthenospheric upwelling, extension, andorogenic collapse following crustal anatexis: the orogenic collapse need not to be driven by the astheno-spheric upwelling or the partial melts in the crust formed during the collision. Instead, thinning of thethickened orogenic lithosphere is enhanced by fluids in the asthenosphere, subducted during and before thecollision, leading to increased geotherm and partial melting of the lower crust. Partial melts weaken the litho-sphere and drive further thinning, and thus further melting. This positive feedback causes loss of lithosphericmantle and extensive crustal melting, both of which drive orogenic collapse. Progressive removal of the litho-spheric mantle provides a heat source for the crustal anatexis, and simultaneously explains the generation oflate-orogenic mantle-derived magmas.Underplating of mantle-derived melts below the crust is found to increase initial crustal melting rates, but tohave a close-to-neutral effect in overall crustal melting on timescales of the whole collision and postcollisionalrelaxation. The source regions of these underplating melts become refractory and form a high-viscosity layerthat inhibits further mantle melting and brings lithosphere foundering to a halt.ReferencesAnnen, C., & Sparks, R.

A., White, Richard W., Hudson, Timothy J. M.",2014,"Ascent of granitic melt initiates under suprasolidus conditions in the mid- to lower crust before continuing through subsolidus rocks to higher crustal levels. Whereas migration of melt in suprasolidus rocks can occur in pervasive net-like structures and involve relatively small melt volumes, ascent through the subsolidus crust requires more focused, dyke-like structures and larger volumes to prevent freezing. Migmatites in the Aus granulite terrain, southern Namibia, preserve evidence that large-scale melt redistribution and accumulation occurred in the near-source region under suprasolidus conditions. Melt that was mainly produced in metapelitic rocks utilised pervasive small-scale leucosome networks to migrate to areas surrounding pre-tectonic granite sheets. These areas are dominated by metapsammitic rocks, and abundant and voluminous leucogranite sheets attest to melt accumulation and residence occurring over a protracted period while the area was undergoing anatexis. However, the leucogranites have an anhydrous mineralogy and the surrounding rocks only preserve evidence for limited, high-temperature retrogression, consistent with substantial melt loss from the accumulation structures. We speculate that melt batches leaving the accumulation sites are likely to have been large, allowing for substantially more efficient ascent through subsolidus crust. Our results suggest that a degree of near-source melt accumulation is likely to occur during the early stages of meltmigration, and that this can significantly enhance the effectiveness of subsequent melt ascent (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The 400 Ma complex consists of gabbro-diorite sheets  overlain by three different granites, the largest of which is an A-type  granite emplaced at high temperature (~900oC) and at shallow crustal  depth (\u3c5km), having fed numerous volcanic eruptions, the products of  which are exposed on the nearby Cranberry Islands. Results from a  contact metamorphism numerical model show that development of the  intrusive complex occurred incrementally, with multiple sequences of  magma emplacement with bimodal composition. Metamorphism continued prior  to wall rock fragmentation and injection of granitic magma. The Shatter  Zone formed during a large volcanic eruption triggered by continued  emplacement of mafic magma, resulting in elastic failure of the  metasedimentary and diorite wall rock and virtually instantaneous  fragmentation and entrainment of the clasts in hot granitic magma. The  degree of brecciation is gradational, with clast supported breccias at  the outer margin of the zone grading inward to granitic-matrix supported  breccia, and finally into clast-free Cadillac Mountain Granite. Field  observations point to an explosive breccia mechanism, and clast size  distribution analysis yields fractal dimensions (Ds \u3e 3) that agree  with those known to result from explosion (Ds \u3e 2.5). Field and  microstructural data and observations suggest that the clast sizes and  shapes of the metasedimentary host rocks reflect post-brecciation  modification by partial melting and thermal fracture, while diorite dike  fragments experienced little modification after the original  brecciation event. Clast circularity increases with proximity to the  magma reservoir, whereas clast boundary shape decreases; this implies  thermal wear on clast surfaces. Numerical modeling is employed to  explore the possible thermalmechanical effects on the size distribution  of clasts. Instantaneous immersion is assumed for metasedimentary clasts  (650°C) in a hot granitic matrix (800°C - 900°C), and our thermal  analysis is restricted to conductive heat transfer corrected for latent  heat. The amount of clast melt is primarily dependent on the melt  temperature of the clast, the matrix to clast volume ratio, and the  initial magma intrusion and clast temperatures. Results show that  thermal fracture and clast melt were viable secondary modification  processes, and magma flow was necessary for disaggregation of melted  clasts to occur. Angular clasts are highly susceptible to corner  break-off owing to large tensile stresses associated with thermal shock.  Considering the effects of these processes on clast size distribution,  we conclude that the Shatter Zone formed from explosion, and latestage  magma emplacement effectively altered the size and shape for many of the  metasedimentary clasts",,text,"Breccia, Ingeous rocks, Earth Sciences, Geology, Physical Sciences and Mathematics",,DigitalCommons@UMaine

This impact history is recorded in the radiogenic clocks of impact melts which are accessible for study on lunar samples and meteorites. However, primary impact melt is exposed to a long-time gardening process (i.e. re-melting, excavation, burial, and re-excavation) by subsequent impacts resulting in a complex spatial distribution of materials representing specific impact events. To investigate the diffusion behavior of impact melt, a model tracing the evolving distribution of melt laterally and with depth was built using a Monte Carlo approach. Given scaling laws concerning melt production and ejecta distribution, the size-frequency distribution of impact craters, and the rate function for crater formation, we examine the evolution of melt component occurrence of different ages. Three mid- to late-forming basins (Serenitatis, Crisium, and Imbrium) are chosen as a case study for the diffusion of melt from major basin-forming events. The survival probability of basin melt occurrence at the Apollo and Luna sampling spots is derived. It is expected to find abundant Imbrium and Crisium melt at the Apollo and Luna sampling sites, consistent with the K-Ar radiometric dates of highland samples; whereas the older Serenitatis melt was subjected to the later long-term gardening, strongly influenced by later local impacts, and thus is less abundant. Understanding the diffusion of impact melt is helpful for interpretation of radiometric ages of lunar samples and can be used to predict the distribution of differently-aged melts at future landing/sampling sites such as the Chinese Chang'E-4 (CE-4)",,"Zeitschriftenbeitrag, PeerReviewed",Planetengeodäsie,,'Elsevier BV'

Here we present a model-based framework to study and quantify the mutational meltdown in a finite diploid population that is evolving continuously in time and subject to resource competition. We model slightly deleterious mutations affecting the population demographic parameters and study how the rate of mutation fixation increases as the geneticload increases, a process that we investigate at two timescales: an ecological scale and a mutational scale. Unlike most previous studies, we treat population size as a random process in continuous time. We show that as deleterious mutations accumulate, the decrease in mean population size accelerates with time relative to a null model with a constant mean fixation time. We quantify this mutational meltdown via the change in the mean fixation time after each new mutation fixation, and we show that the meltdown appears less severe than predicted by earlier theoretical work.

UHP slices of continental crust are usually involved in multistage exhumation and partial melting, which has obvious influence on the rheological features of the rocks, and thus significantly affect the dynamic behavior of subducted slices. Moreover, partial melting of UHP rocks have significant influence on element mobility and related isotope behavior within continental subduction zones, which is in turn crucial to chemical differentiation of the continental crust and to crust-mantle interaction.Partial melting can occur before, during or after the peak metamorphism of UHP rocks. Post-peak decompression melting has been better constrained by remelting experiments; however, because of multiple stages of decompression, retrogression and deformation, evidence of former melts in UHP rocks is often erased. Field evidence is among the most reliable criteria to infer partial melting. Glass and nanogranitoid inclusions are generally considered conclusive petrographic evidence. The residual assemblages after melt extraction are also significant to indicate partial melting in some cases. Besides field and petrographic evidence, bulk-rock and zircon trace-element geochemical features are also effective tools for recognizing partial melting of UHP rocks. Phase equilibrium modeling is an important petrological tool that is becoming more and more popular in P-T estimation of the evolution of metamorphic rocks; by taking into account the activity model of silicate melt, it can predict when partial melting occurred if the P-T path of a given rock is provided.UHP silicate melt is commonly leucogranitic and peraluminous in composition with high SiO2, low MgO, FeO, MnO, TiO2 and CaO, and variable K2O and Na2O contents. Mineralogy of nanogranites found in UHP rocks mainly consists of plagioclase + K-feldspar + quartz, plagioclase being commonly albite-rich. Trace element pattern of the melt is characterized by significant enrichment of large ion lithophile elements (LILE), depletion of heavy rare earth elements (HREE) and high field strength elements (HFSE), indicating garnet and rutile stability in the residual assemblage. In eclogites, significant Mg-isotope fractionation occurs between garnet and phengite; therefore, Mg isotopes may become an effective indicator for partial melting of eclogites.

Collisional orogens are characterized by clockwise P-T evolution, which means that in the core, where temperatures exceed the wet solidus for common crustal rocks, melt may be present throughout a signicant portion of the evolution. Field observa-tions of eroded orogens show that lower crust is migmatitic, and geophysical observations have been interpreted to suggest the presence of melt in active orogens. A consequence of these results is that orogenic collapse in mature orogens may be controlled by a partially-molten layer that decouples weak crust from subducting lithosphere, and such a weak layer may enable exhumation of deeply buried crust. Migmatites provide a record of melt segregation in partially molten crustal materi-als and syn-anatectic deformation under natural conditions. Grain boundary flow and intra- and inter-grain fracture flow are the principal grain scale melt flow mechanisms. Field observations of migmatites in ancient orogens show that leucosomes occur oriented in the metamorphic fabrics or are located in dilational sites.

invasional meltdown hypothesis,79617372,"Shock Metamorphism and Impact Melting at Kamil Crater, Egypt",,"FAZIO, AGNESE",2015,"Shock effects in small terrestrial impact craters (diameter < 300 m) have been poorly studied because small craters are rare and often deeply eroded. Kamil is a young (< 5000 yr), small (45-m-in-diameter), and well preserved impact structure caused by the hypervelocity impact of the iron meteorite Gebel Kamil on sedimentary rocks in southwestern Egypt. Its pristine state of preservation makes Kamil a natural laboratory for the study of the cratering process of small impactors (about 1-m-in-diameter) on Earth, their consequences, and their impact on the terrestrial environment for hazard assessment. This PhD Thesis deals with the definition of the shock metamorphism and impact melting in small terrestrial impact craters through a comprehensive mineralogical, petrographic, and geochemical study of shock-metamorphosed rocks and impact melts from Kamil. This study also allows us to constrain the impact cratering process related to the impact of meter-sized iron meteorites on Earth. The results of this PhD Thesis highlight for the first time that a meter size iron body impacting on a sedimentary target can produce a wide range of shock features. These divide into two categories as a function of their abundance at the thin section scale: i) pervasive shock features (the most abundant), including fracturing, planar deformation features, and impact melt lapilli and bombs, and ii) localized shock features including high-pressure phases and localized impact melting in the form of intergranular melt, melt veins, and melt films in shatter cones. Pervasive shock features indicate the shock pressure suffered by rocks. The most shocked samples (impact melt lapilli and bombs) indicate that the shock pressure at the contact point between the projectile and the target was between 30 and 60 GPa. Based on the planar impact approximation model, this implies that the impact velocity of Gebel Kamil was at least 5 km s-1, for an impact angle of 45°. Localized shock features formed from the local enhancement of shock pressure and temperature at pores and/or at the heterogeneities of the target rocks. Thus, it is possible to find high-pressure phases and intergranular melting in sample that suffered low or moderate shock pressures. In small meteorite impacts, the projectile may survive the impact through fragmentation. In addition, it may melt and interact with both shocked and melted target rocks. The interaction between target and projectile liquids is a process yet to be completely understood. Impact melt lapilli and bombs from Kamil are very fresh and their study can help constrain the target-projectile interaction. Two types of glasses constitute the impact melt lapilli and bombs: a white glass and a dark glass. The white glass is inclusion-free, mostly SiO2, and has negligible amounts of Ni and Co, suggesting derivation from the target rocks with negligible interaction with the projectile liquid (<0.1 wt% of projectile contamination). The dark glass is made of a silicate glass with variable amounts of Al, Fe, and Ni. It also includes variously shocked and melted fragments from the target and projectile (Ni-Fe metal blebs). All this indicates an extensive interaction with the projectile liquid. The dark glass is thus a mixture of target and projectile (estimated projectile contamination 11-12 wt%) liquids. Based on the recently proposed models for the target-projectile interaction and for impact glass formation, we propose a model for the glass formation at Kamil. Between the contact and compression stage and the excavation stage, projectile and target liquids can chemically interact in a restricted zone. The projectile contamination affected only a shallow portion of the impacted target rocks. White glass formed out of this zone, escaping interaction with the projectile. During the excavation stage, due to a brief and chaotic time sequence and the high temperature, dark glass engulfed and coated white glass and target fragments and stuck on iron meteorite shrapnel fragments. The microscopic impactor debris, systematically collected from the soil around Kamil, includes vesicular masses, spherules, and coatings of dark impact melt glass that is a mixture of impactor and target materials (Si, Fe, Al-rich glass), and Fe-Ni oxide spherules and mini shrapnel fragments. As a consequence of an oblique impact, this material formed a downrange ejecta curtain of microscopic impactor debris due SE-SW of the crater (extension ~300,000 m2, up to ~400 m from the crater), consistent with previous determination of the impactor trajectory.

All else being equal, the larger the intrusion volume, the farther the intrusion can spread and the smaller its aspect ratio is. The final aspect ratio is a function of a single dimensionless number analogous to the Rayleigh number of thermal convection. Once it is denser than its surroundings, the intrusion becomes unstable and may founder in two different regimes. At aspect ratios larger than about 0.4, the """"teardrop"""" regime is such that the intrusion thickens in a central region, developing the shapes of a funnel and a pendant drop. At lower aspect ratios, another regime is observed, with thickening of the intrusion at the leading edge and thinning in a central region. The thick outer ring in turn becomes unstable into a set of teardrops and leads to an irregular horizontal outline. In one variant called the """"jellyfish"""" regime, the thin central region develops a number of downwellings and upwellings in a Rayleigh-Taylor-like pattern. These instabilities may get arrested due to cooling as the intrusion and encasing rocks become too strong to deform.

However, these multidisciplinary research efforts across the globe have been largely unsuccessful to date, with one outstanding exception: the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary. The unicausal impact scenario as a leading explanation, when applied to the complex fossil record, has resulted in force−fitting of data and interpretations (“great expectations syndrome”). The misunderstandings can be grouped at three successive levels of the testing process, and involve the unreflective application of the impact paradigm: (i) factual misidentification, i.e., an erroneous or indefinite recognition of the extraterrestrial record in sedimentological, physical and geochemical contexts, (ii) correlative misinterpretation of the adequately documented impact signals due to their incorrect dating, and (iii) causal overestimation when the proved impact characteristics are doubtful as a sufficient trigger of a contemporaneous global cosmic catastrophe. Examples of uncritical belief in the simple cause−effect scenario for the Frasnian–Famennian, Permian–Triassic, and Triassic–Jurassic (and the Eifelian–Givetian and Paleocene–Eocene as well) global events include mostly item−1 pitfalls (factual misidentification), with Ir enrichments and shocked minerals frequently misidentified. Therefore, these mass extinctions are still at the first test level, and only the F–F extinction is potentially seen in the context of item−2, the interpretative step, because of the possible causative link with the Siljan Ring crater (53 km in diameter). The erratically recognized cratering signature is often marked by large timing and size uncertainties, and item−3, the advanced causal inference, is in fact limited to clustered impacts that clearly predate major mass extinctions. The multi−impact lag−time pattern is particularly clear in the Late Triassic, when the largest (100 km diameter) Manicouagan crater was possibly concurrent with the end−Carnian extinction (or with the late Norian tetrapod turnover on an alternative time scale). The relatively small crater sizes and cratonic (crystalline rock basement) setting of these two craters further suggest the strongly insufficient extraterrestrial trigger of worldwide environmental traumas. However, to discuss the kill potential of impact events in a more robust fashion, their location and timing, vulnerability factors, especially target geology and palaeogeography in the context of associated climate−active volatile fluxes, should to be rigorously assessed. The current lack of conclusive impact evidence synchronous with most mass extinctions may still be somewhat misleading due to the predicted large set of undiscovered craters, particularly in light of the obscured record of oceanic impact events",,info:eu-repo/semantics/article,,,Polska Akademia Nauk.

Due to this complexity, mechanisms of continental convergence are versatile and different, in many aspects from those that control oceanic subduction. Elucidating these mechanisms from conventional observations is difficult, and requires additional constraints such as those derived from petrological data. Indeed, exhumation of HP/UHP rocks is an integral part of convergent processes, and burial/exhumation dynamics inferred from metamorphic P-T-t paths provides strong constraints on the collision scenarios. Metamorphic rocks also play an active role due to their contrasting physical properties (rheology, density, fluid transport capacity). Numerical thermo-mechanical experiments suggest that HP/UHP exhumation can only be produced in subduction contexts, as well as that long-lasting (> 10 Myr) continental subduction can only occur in case of cold strong lithospheres (TMoho  50 km) and of relatively high convergence rates (> 3-5 cm yr− 1 ). In this case, high density UHP material in the crustal part of subduction interface provides additional pull on the slab and is not always exhumed to the surface. In case of slower convergence and/or weaker lithosphere (Te  3-5 cm yr− 1).

In this review,  new evidence in terms of ice melting, post-glacial rebound and earthquake  occurrence is gathered and discussed to re-evaluate the connection between  ice mass unloading and earthquake suppression. In Greenland, the spatiotemporal distribution of earthquakes indicates that seismicity is mainly confined to regions where the thick layer of ice is absent and where significant ice melting is presently occurring. A clear correlation between seismic activity and ice melting in Greenland is not found. However, earthquake locations and corresponding depth distributions suggest two distinct governing mechanisms: post-glacial rebound promotes moderate-size crustal earthquakes at Greenland’s regional scale, while current ice melting promotes shallow low magnitude seismicity locally",,info:eu-repo/semantics/article,"Greenland, Earthquake, Ice sheet melting",,
invasional meltdown hypothesis,100835283,Avalanches at the core-mantle boundary,,Richard A. Muller,2014,"Abstract. The partial collapse of topographic structure at the core-mantle boundary (CMB) in avalanches, slumps or turbidity flows, would cause sudden temperature changes in both the upper core and the lower mantle. Although such collapses are hypothetical, it is interesting to investigate the potential consequences. Downwelling from such events could disrupt core convection cells and trigger geomagnetic excursions and reversals. Buoyant sediment from the freezing of the inner core is hypothesized to rebuild the avalanched structures. Large avalanches could trigger Mantle plumes. Oblique extraterrestrial impacts impart high shear to the CMB, and can trigger one or more simultaneous avalanches, yielding observed coincidences between craters, tektite fields and reversals. A triggered avalanche can explain the coincidence between the formation of the largest known volcanic province (the Ontong-Java Plateau), the start of the 35 Myr Cretaceous geomagnetic quiet period, and reported coincidences between large flood basalts and extinctions",,text,,,

Damian Nance",2013,"The supercontinent cycle has had a profound effect on the Earth's evolution since the Late Archean but our understanding of the forces responsible for its operation remains elusive. Supercontinents appear to form by two end-member processes: extroversion, in which the oceanic lithosphere surrounding the supercontinent (exterior ocean) is preferentially subducted (e.g. Pannotia), and introversion in which the oceanic lithosphere formed between dispersing fragments of the previous supercontinent (interior ocean) is preferentially subducted (e.g. Pangea). Extroversion can be explained by “top–down” geodynamics, in which a supercontinent breaks up over a geoid high and amalgamates above a geoid low. Introversion, on the other hand, requires that the combined forces of slab-pull and ridge push (which operate in concert after supercontinent break-up) must be overcome in order to enable the previously dispersing continents to turn inward. Introversion may begin when subduction zones are initiated along boundaries between the interior and exterior oceans and become trapped within the interior ocean. We speculate that the reversal in continental motion required for introversion may be induced by slab avalanche events that trigger the rise of superplumes from the core-mantle boundary",,article,"Supercontinent cycle, Introversion, Extroversion, Pangea, Rodinia, Pannotia, Geology, QE1-996.5",1674-9871,Elsevier

However, it is unclear whether the cause of voluminous melt production at volcanic rifts is primarily increased mantle temperature or plate thinning1,2,8–12. Also disputed is the extent to which plate stretching or thinning is uniform or varies with depth with the entire continental lithospheric mantle potentially being removed before plate rupture13–16. Here we show that the extensive magmatism during rifting along the southern Red Sea rift in Afar, a unique region of sub-aerial transition from continental to oceanic rifting, is driven by deep melting of hotter- than-normal asthenosphere. Petrogenetic modelling shows that melts are predominantly generated at depths greater than 80 kilometres, implying the existence of a thick upper thermo-mechanical boundary layer in a rift system approaching the point of plate rupture. Numerical modelling of rift development shows that when breakup occurs at the slow extension rates observed in Afar, the survival of a thick plate is an inevitable consequence of conductive cooling of the lithosphere, even when the underlying astheno-sphere is hot. Sustained magmatic activity during rifting in Afar thus requires persistently high mantle temperatures, which would allow melting at high pressure beneath the thick plate. If extensive plate thinning does occur during breakup it must do so abruptly at a late stage, immediately before the formation of the new ocean basin16",,QE,QE,,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC'

Evidence for this interaction is based on petrographic, microstructural and chemical examination of the 46.37-m-thick impact melt rock sequence, which overlies shocked granitoid target rock of the peak ring of the Chicxulub impact structure. The melt rock sequence consists of two visually distinct phases, one is black and the other is green in colour. The black phase is aphanitic and trachyandesitic in composition and similar to melt rock from other sites within the impact structure. The green phase consists chiefly of clay minerals and sparitic calcite, which likely formed from a solidified water–rock debris mixture under hydrothermal conditions. We suggest that the layering and internal structure of the melt rock sequence resulted from a single process, i.e., violent contact of initially superheated silicate impact melt with the ocean resurge-induced water–rock mixture overriding the impact melt. Differences in density, temperature, viscosity, and velocity of this mixture and impact melt triggered Kelvin–Helmholtz and Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities at their phase boundary. As a consequence, shearing at the boundary perturbed and, thus, mingled both immiscible phases, and was accompanied by phreatomagmatic processes. These processes led to the brecciation at the top of the impact melt rock sequence. Quenching of this breccia by the seawater prevented reworking of the solidified breccia layers upon subsequent deposition of suevite.

We propose and evaluate a subglacial eruption mechanism with potential for rapid ablation of the overlying ice that involves the impact of pyroclasts on the ice surfaces of depressurised, vapour dominated ice cavities that surround subglacial vents. Such impacts are likely to cause considerable fracturing and mechanical fragmentation of the ice and thus increase the heat transfer area available for ice-melt. This mechanism has not, to our knowledge, been explored previously in the literature, but we find that published experimental work on impact cratering of icy solar system bodies can be used to predict fragmentation damage by pyroclast impact. Our principal conclusions are as follows. (1) Ice ablation rates of order 100 m h−1 are predicted, for typical pyroclast velocities, provided that the mechanism is sustained. (2) The thermal energy of the eruption, together with the size of the ice fragments produced, is sufficient to prevent accumulation of fractured ice within the cavity. (3) Upward ablation of the ice cavity roof results in a progressive decrease in pyroclast impact velocity that is partly compensated by downward movement of the roof by ductile ice flow. (4) This ice ablation mechanism is likely common during subglacial eruptions on the relatively steep slopes of ice-covered stratovolcanoes, where steepness of slope and ice thickness are favourable for rapid drainage of meltwater by gravity and consequent depressurisation of the cavity. © 2022 Elsevier B.V",,"Journal Article, PeerReviewed",,,'Elsevier BV'
invasional meltdown hypothesis,159613837,Melt-induced buoyancy may explain the elevated rift-rapid sag paradox during breakup of continental plates,10.1038/s41598-018-27981-2,"Quirk, David G., Rüpke, Lars H.",2018,"The division of the earth’s surface into continents and oceans is a consequence of plate tectonics but a geological paradox exists at continent-ocean boundaries. Continental plate is thicker and lighter than oceanic plate, floating higher on the mantle asthenosphere, but it can rift apart by thinning and heating to form new oceans. In theory, continental plate subsides in proportion to the amount it is thinned and subsequently by the rate it cools down. However, seismic and borehole data from continental margins like the Atlantic show that the upper surface of many plates remains close to sea-level during rifting, inconsistent with its thickness, and subsides after breakup more rapidly than cooling predicts. Here we use numerical models to investigate the origin and nature of this puzzling behaviour with data from the Kwanza Basin, offshore Angola. We explore an idea where the continental plate is made increasingly buoyant during rifting by melt produced and trapped in the asthenosphere. Using finite element simulation, we demonstrate that partially molten asthenosphere combined with other mantle processes can counteract the subsidence effect of thinning plate, keeping it elevated by 2-3 km until breakup. Rapid subsidence occurs after breakup when melt is lost to the embryonic ocean ridge","1  Supplementary Information for  Melt-induced buoyancy may explain the elevated rift-rapid sag paradox during breakup of continental plates  David G.

Timing of breakup relative to the sag and salt intervals in central South Atlantic Disparities in the rates and timing of subsidence at rifted margins from those predicted by McKenzie’s rift-cooling model1 are expressed as thinner than expected syn-rift thicknesses, greater than expected early post-rift thicknesses and subaerial-shallow water conditions at breakup rather than deep water2-26. These issues are well known in the central South Atlantic region where, for example, the early post-rift sag and salt section is >4 km thick in northern Kwanza and composed of shallow water-emergent carbonates and evaporites. This has led some researchers to argue that the sag and salt intervals (Aptian, 123-113 Ma) are actually late syn-rift3,15,27. However, neither water depths nor basin geometry really support the idea (e.g. Model tR113, Figs.S1 and S2). In particular, the absence of extensional growth faults in the sag2-5,10,15,27 (Fig. S3) and the geometric requirement of large trans-continental shears in plate reconstructions to accommodate late breakup24,25,28, leads us to strongly favour breakup at c.123 Ma (pre-sag). This interpretation is supported by reported ages of syn-rift, sag and mid-ocean ridge-type basalts in wells drilled at or close to the point of breakup in deep water Angola by Statoil, ConocoPhillips and Total in 2014-2015 (e.g. Dilolo-1, Jacare-1, Kamoxi-1, Umbundu-1) and by more recent plate reconstructions5,29,30 (Movie S4).   Information on the ages of rifting The best estimate of the onset of rifting is 131 Ma based on the oldest syn-rift sediments which are Hauterivian in age16. The precursor Paraná volcanics are precisely constrained by 40Ar/39Ar dating to 135 Ma +/- 1 My31 and uniform layering within them shows that they were erupted before extension began. Information on the timing of the end of rifting (123 Ma) is reported in the main article and in Refs.2,5,8,16,18,30.   2  Seismic interpretation The nature of the seismic units in the central South Atlantic region has previously been described by Ref.5. The syn-rift interval is characterized by tilted and fanning reflection geometries. Strong parallel reflections at the base of the syn-rift interval correlate with the top of basalt (the major Paraná eruptive event, the precursor to rifting in the central South Atlantic region8,31). The top of the syn-rift interval is marked by an angular unconformity onto which flat-lying sag strata progressively overstep (Fig. S3). The top of the sag is a flat horizon above which the salt has a clear but chaotic seismic expression resulting from salt tectonic movement. The top of the salt is marked by a strong seismic reflection and is overlain by Albian carbonates characterized by growth, fault and fold geometries. These structures were formed during gravity spreading as the salt tilted towards the ocean as a result of enhanced subsidence in that direction18.   Are anomalous subsidence patterns during breakup related to mantle plumes? The aim of our work is to find a generic solution for the common problem of elevated breakup and subsequent collapse at rifted margins6,11. We acknowledge that the thermal and dynamic effect of a mantle plume can have a semi-regional effect32-34. However, we feel that this is not a universal explanation for the subsidence issue associated with McKenzie’s model1 during the breakup of continental plates. Nonetheless, one of us (D.G.Q., Ref.5) has previously promoted this idea for a region of the central South Atlantic lying south of the current study area (Fig.S3), where syn-rift strata are particularly thin. It is therefore feasible that anomalous uplift caused by mantle plumes may enhance buoyancy caused by melt and phase changes in the mantle but probably not along every rift margin.    Information on melt produced during rifting In the accompanying article, we explore the idea that melt is retained in the asthenosphere during rifting and lost rapidly after breakup. That melt exists in the mantle beneath modern continental and oceanic rifts is recognized from an increase in electrical conductivity, a reduction in seismic velocities and a decrease in gravity35-60. The geophysical evidence for melt is also supported by theoretical models, experiments and geochemical data61-73. Unfortunately, the amount of melt is difficult to constrain because many properties of the asthenosphere such as interconnectivity of melt-filled pores and permeability are poorly constrained with large uncertainties in physical characteristics, including the shape and alignment of melt inclusions40,43,74-77 and whether the peridotite is in textural equilibrium78-80.  As geophysical data and geodynamic models grow, two different hypotheses have emerged on the amount of melt present beneath modern rifts, with continental and oceanic rifts often treated similarly. 1) A common view is that dihedral angles of melt formed in olivine-rich peridotite are significantly less than 60o 79,81 and the peridotite is texturally equilibriated78 meaning that melt flows through the matrix at very low porosities. Consequently, the mantle will retain less than c.2% melt35,62,70,83-86, migrating out of the source region faster than it is generated67,87. This view is supported by various geophysical interpretations of <1%-3% melt in regions of upwelling asthenosphere43, more commonly in oceanic domains 48,50,54-56,59,88. 3  2) Alternative experimental work and theoretical models indicate that lherzolite can actually retain 5%-c.20% melt79,80,89,90, consistent with other geophysical interpretations of c.5-16% melt in zones 30-100 km thick and 30->150 km wide in the upper mantle44,46,47,91, including continental regions52. For example, Ref.92, using magnetotellurics, and Ref.77, using P-S wave velocities and anisotropy, have independently produced similar estimates of 6-15% melt over an interval 30-60 km thick in the upper mantle beneath the Dabbahu rift segment in Afar, Ethiopia, equivalent to a melt column of 3-10 km. Assuming these interpretations are valid, there are five potential reasons for high melt retention. a) Where peridotite is neither mono-mineralic nor equi-granular, melt does not become interconnected until porosities of somewhere between 5-20%79,80,90. b) Textural equilibrium is difficult to establish in flowing mantle77. c) Interfacial tension presents a significant barrier to compaction- and buoyancy-driven flow at porosities of less than c.20%, even where grain boundaries are wet89,93. d) Viscous resistance to flow means migration can be slower than generation86,94. e) Melt flowing between crystals or carried upwards in circulating asthenosphere is trapped by a viscous lid of mantle lithosphere which represents a permeability barrier39,56,88,95,96, ultimately resulting in crystal fractionation96-98.   One of the key points is that melting experiments on real peridotite show there is a drastic reduction in the interconnectivity of pores when minerals other than olivine are present80. As much as 21-29% basaltic melt can be retained in lherzolite containing less than c.80% olivine90 up to the point of disaggregation89. A typical fertile lherzolite comprises 60% olivine, 20% orthopyroxene, 10% clinopyroxene and 10% garnet or spinel or plagioclase99, so theoretically all the aluminium-rich phases, all the clinopyroxene and some orthopyroxene have to melt before the pores become fully connected. Thus, it may be that melt is retained in asthenosphere composed of heterogeneous lherzolite but will tend to flow out when it is mostly olivine, provided interfacial tension is overcome89. However, in the continental domain a more significant permeability barrier exists at the top of the asthenosphere in the form of the continental plate95,96,98. Magma can only ascend through the overlying lithospheric mantle in discrete, fracture-assisted intrusions rather than by porous flow9,43,74,84. These considerations offer a way of aligning models of low versus high melt retention beneath rifted margins.  Prior to breakup, when rifting reaches a peak, large amounts of melt have been generated and a significant proportion is temporarily retained in the upwelling asthenosphere, initially because porous flow is inhibited in multi-mineralic, non-equilibriated lherzolite and thereafter because the overlying lithosphere forms a closed lid. The zone of melt-impregnated asthenosphere will tend to drain downwards by capillary action, a wetting profile driven by grain–grain tension.  After breakup, the mantle down to c.90 km below the inactive rifted margins is largely devoid of garnet-spinel-plagioclase and clinopyroxene, these minerals having already been lost to melt. The depleted asthenosphere consists predominantly of olivine-rich, texturally-equilibriated harzburgite-dunite with a dihedral angle significantly less than 60o meaning most of the remaining melt is interconnected at low porosities (<1-3%) and migrates relatively quickly to the base of the lithosphere. Provided the melt does not solidify, it will then flow up-dip towards the edge of the continental plate to be incorporated in thick oceanic crust created at the new spreading axis. As the depleted asthenosphere cools, it is gradually accreted to the base of the continental plate to form new lithosphere together with melt which has solidified before reaching the oceanic domain.  4   With these processes in mind, we suggest it is possible that asthenosphere retains 5-16% melt during the latter stages of continental rifting prior to breakup52,77,92, more than below mid-ocean ridges where there is no mantle lid. In our melt models, we actually use average amounts at the lower end of this range (those prefixed M and F in Figs. 1 and 2 in the accompanying article, Figs.S1 and S2 and Movies S1-S3).  It is also worth noting that the presence of melt beneath an extending plate is likely to cause periodic intrusions of sills or underplates into the lithosphere97,, an effect which may partly compensate for thinning of the plate, allowing certain rifted margins to become surprisingly wide (e.g. Fig.8 in ref.5). Underplates are quite well documented beneath central South Atlantic rifted margins with interpreted thicknesses up to 6 km14,25.  Based on the arguments above, we test the effect of relatively high melt retention in the asthenosphere. The idea is that beneath continental rifts up to breakup i) significant porosity is required for melt to become interconnected in the asthenosphere76,79,80,89,90 and ii) the base of the continental lithosphere acts as a lid39,57,88,95,96,98.  Once it becomes interconnected, melt migrates upwards through the asthenosphere by porous flow, controlled by compaction and buoyancy, viscosity, permeability and surface tensions62,67,89,93,94,99. The upward migrating melt will be impeded by continental mantle lithosphere and the zone of melt-impregnated asthenosphere will then increase in thickness downwards by capillary action, with wetting driven by grain–grain tension to give a smoothly decreasing melt profile89,93, as used in our models (Fig. 1c in main article).  We choose to limit the average amount of melt in the asthenosphere to 8%, starting with 0% at 90 km depth up to a maximum of 16% at 20 km close to the point of breakup where the lithosphere is highly attenuated (stretching factor of >7.5, Figs. S4c and S4d). This is equivalent to a maximum column of 5.6 km melt. However, over most of the Kwanza Basin, where stretching factors are <5 (Fig. S4c), a column less than half this amount has developed in our models by the end of rifting. For comparison, more melt is involved in the construction of oceanic crust but here it ascends relatively quickly to a mid-ocean ridge, unimpeded by lithosphere. A total column of 7.5 km melt is needed for average oceanic crust73,82,97 but as much as 12-24 km of melt may be involved during the formation of volcanic rifted margins9,87,96.   We do not argue for unusual mantle conditions of temperature, only that a significant proportion of melt cannot migrate out of the asthenosphere until after breakup. In our models, the asthenosphere wells up passively while the lithosphere extends, a general assumption in most models of continental rifts13,83. In reality, the presence of melt in the asthenosphere may enhance convection due to buoyancy and a possible reduction in viscosity60,61,83,99,100 although Ref.101 suggests that viscosity may initially increase as the asthenosphere becomes drier with melting. If active upwelling or a mantle plume are associated with rifting, then higher degrees of melt are expected due to replenishment of fertile peridotite96 or higher temperatures64,82 which will lead to more volcanism at breakup87.  5  Information on loss of melt after breakup During rifting, significant columns of melt may be trapped beneath continental lithosphere until it breaks, after which it is likely to drain rapidly to the new volcanic ridge87,94,102. This may explain the release of huge volumes of magma over short periods of time forming thick crust on volcanic margins82,96,97,102 as well as outer volcanic highs on non-volcanic margins5,23,103. In the North Atlantic Igneous Province, Ref.104 suggests that a c.7 km column of melt per unit area was released to the crust in the 5 My up to breakup followed by 6-17 km soon after breakup, which we suggest was partly due to lateral migration of melt stored in the asthenosphere (cf. Ref.105).  After breakup, the asthenosphere beneath the rifted margins ceases to flow and textural equilibrium is re-established. Melt production also stops and porosity decreases causing the rate of melt migration to decline. The density of the mantle will increase as melt is lost, causing the rifted margins to subside. Based on empirical observations of post-breakup volcanism and thicknesses of early post-rift sag5, we expect melt to be lost at an exponential rate with only small percentages left after 10 My, although the lithosphere continues to thicken and subside by cooling.   Basin reconstruction approach TecMod is modeling software for lithosphere-scale basin tectonic, isostatic, stratigraphic, thermal modeling which accounts for the feedbacks between sedimentary, crustal, and mantle processes106. It is designed to produce automated 2D basin models using present day stratigraphy as input, from which the structural and thermal evolution of a rifted basin is automatically reconstructed. This is achieved through the coupling of a lithosphere scale forward model with an inverse algorithm for automated parameter optimization. This kind of algorithm allows the feedbacks and interactions between shallow sedimentary and deep lithosphere/asthenosphere processes to be investigated, which are difficult to predict without iterative modeling.  Given the number of physical processes involved and the range of parameters, the evolution of sedimentary basins cannot be uniquely reconstructed. The strategy employed in TecMod is scenario analysis performed on the (user-specified) geologically most likely end member cases, which yields a possible range in target parameters (mainly temperature, heatflow and related aspects though time and space). As demonstrated by Ref.106, the actual fitting process of crustal and mantle stretching factors, water depth, sediment fill, thermal conditioning and isostatic adjustment can be fully automated by casting the problem in terms of a constrained optimization problem107,108. The goal function to be minimized is the misfit between observed and modeled stratigraphic data where additional constraints can be imposed (e.g. finite rifting durations, maximum stretching factors, weighting between different events). The inversion consists of an iterative search for the optimal set of crustal and mantle stretching factors and palaeo-water depth values, which minimize the chosen goal function109,110. The forward run requires an initial guess for stretching factors and water depth which are successively improved by iteration with the inverse algorithm according to the scheme described by Ref.106.  The 2D model is locally based on pure shear kinematics and resolves simultaneously differential thinning, flexural isostasy, heat transfer, sedimentation, erosion and compaction on a Lagrangian finite-element mesh. The general modeling strategy is that the structural and 6  thermal solutions are in equilibrium after every simulation time step. This is achieved by resolving simultaneously for deep lithosphere and shallow sedimentary basin processes. During every time step, the entire computational mesh is deformed with the mantle and crustal stretching factors, new sediment packages are deposited and become part of the computational domain. Flexural isostasy is ensured by further movement of the mesh in the vertical direction.  Heat transfer occurs by advection and diffusion:                                   i i x z i i iT T T T Tc v v k k At x z x x z z   (1)  where t is time and vx and vz are the velocities in the horizontal x- and vertical z-direction, respectively. In the employed Lagrangian reference frame, the numerical grid is deformed with the pure shear velocities so that the advection terms in equation (1) are automatically accounted for. In the case of differential thinning, re-meshing of the mantle ensures geometric consistency between the crust/sediments and the mantle portions of the modeling domain. ρ, ci, T, ki and Ai are density, specific heat, temperature, thermal conductivity and radiogenic heat production rate, respectively. The index i illustrates that the property is dependent on the local rock type. The thermal conductivity of the sediments is an effective material property that results from geometric averaging of the local matrix conductivity ( km) and pore-fluid conductivity (kw)111,112:    (1 ) ( )  m wk k k         (2)  where φ is porosity.

Crustal and mantle densities evolve during basin formation as functions of thinning, melt production, magmatic intrusion, heat transfer and sediment and water loading as well as phase transitions115,116. The resulting stresses on the lithosphere are projected onto a plate with an assumed elastic thickness and are compensated by isostasy 117-119. The equation describing the vertical deflection of the top of the crust, w, due to flexural isostasy is:       2 22 2         m inwD g w S qx x     (4)  where x, D,  ρm,  ρin, g, and S are the horizontal coordinate, the flexural rigidity, the average density of the lithospheric mantle, the average density of the basin infill (compacted sediments), the acceleration due to gravity and the kinematic deflection due to necking. The differential load, q, represents differences in load relative to the load in the equilibrium state. The flexural 7  rigidity, D, is a cubic function of the effective elastic thickness (Te), which can be kept either constant or determined by the depth of a specified isotherm120 or the thickness of the crust. The kinematic deflection S, i.e. the surface depression that results from stretching and not from isostatic compensation, is calculated using the crustal thinning factors and the depth of necking118. Both ends of the elastic beam are either matched to an analytical solution of a beam clamped at infinity or the modeling domain is extended laterally to minimize boundary effects. Although elastic thickness is believed to be close to zero during late rifting as the plate is thin and hot12, flexural isostasy was nonetheless tested (e.g. Model ELT10, Table 1 in main article). The results were similar to those assuming elastic thickness is 0 km and the effect of flexure is therefore regarded as insignificant during breakup.  Sediments are incorporated in the thermal solver to resolve blanketing effects 121-124. Sediment deposition is controlled by the time dependent water depth which comes out of the inversion (see below). For each time step, a local sedimentation rate is iteratively computed so that at the end of a time step, i.e. after sedimentation, compaction, isostatic compensation and flexure, the basin is filled to the pre-computed water depth. The deposited sediments are compacted using empirical compaction laws, specifically those published by Refs.125,126 that have the form:    0 exp( )  i i ic z         (5)  where φ is porosity, c is a compaction length scale and z the burial depth.   The boundary conditions for the thermal solver are user-specified fixed temperatures at the base and top of the numerical domain and zero horizontal heat flow at the sides utilizing a finite element method-based code. This allows the use of a body-fitting Lagrangian mesh strategy and ensures that all material contrasts are accurately resolved. The model and its individual components have been tested versus a number of analytical solutions including tectonic subsidence, thermal subsidence and steady state heat flow, with radioactive heat production rates decaying exponentially with depth.  Modifications and parameterization of melting and melt migration. We have introduced new features to TecMod in order to test our main hypothesis that melt retention is an important source of buoyancy during and shortly after breakup of continental plates. This has required i) tracking of the lithosphere- asthenosphere boundary (LAB) and accounting for possible compositional changes across it, ii) resolving melt generation, iii) melt migration, and iv) melt emplacement.  Tracking of the LAB has been implemented by assigning distinct rock properties to the oceanic and continental lithospheres and asthenospheres (Table S1). The employed Lagrangian mesh allows accurate tracking of the LAB during active syn-rift and passive post-rift deformation.  Simulations of decompression melting and melt migration continue to be numerically challenging. Models explicitly designed to resolve these processes typically use published solidus functions to solve for melt generation and the equations of compaction driven fluid flow to track the produced melts during their ascent towards the surface. We have deliberately not taken this approach. Models and observations on melt generation, retention and migration are still difficult to reconcile with geophysically inferred melt fractions in various rift settings as they are often 8  significantly higher than predicted by models. This and the considerable technical challenges associated with implementing melt migration into basin modeling software like TecMod has led us to derive a parameterization of melting and melt migration which allows us to investigate different scenarios that are consistent with geophysically inferred melt fractions.   We have parameterized decompression mantle melting by assuming that the degree of melting scales with the heights to which the LAB rises. The onset of melting is assumed to occur at 90 km depth, consistent with published solidus functions65,69,94,98. The concentration of melt is then assumed to increase linearly up to a specified depth of 20 km, where a maximum degree of melting of 16% is reached (average melt content of 8 %), which is consistent with observations at active rift zones and melt fractions calculated for adiabatic mantle upwelling72. Melt extraction is parameterized by assuming that the continental lithosphere is a permeability barrier for rising melts. As long as it is intact, melts are retained within the underlying asthenosphere. After breakup, loss of melt occurs exponentially at a prescribed rate of, for example, 15% every 1 My, meaning that more than half has been lost after 5 My and less than 2% melt remains in the asthenosphere after 10 My.   In addition, we have implemented the option to intrude igneous underplates. This allows us to explore scenarios in which a gabbroic sill of thickness equivalent to a specified fraction of the melt retained in the asthenosphere (e.g. 25%) is emplaced below the crust during every time step. For the Kwanza model reported in the accompanying article, this results in an underplate 5 km thick at the point of breakup tapering to 0 km towards the inboard edge of the rifted margin.  Finally, we use the models of Ref.116 (specifically R123 peridotite) to test the effect that mineral phase changes in the mantle (both lithosphere and asthenosphere) have on the isostatic equilibrium of the plate.   Plate reconstructions Recent plate reconstructions for the South Atlantic (Refs.29,30 and Movie S4) use tectono-stratigraphic ages that fit with the comprehensive well and seismic data acquired by the oil industry in Brazil and Angola5,8,16. The first oceanic crust in the central South Atlantic area is interpreted to have formed around 123 Ma (early Aptian), correlating with the breakup unconformity at the base of the pre-salt sag strata and corresponding to the age of the outer volcanic high which marks the inner edge of oceanic crust in Angola5. The sag strata (123-117 Ma) and the overlying salt (117-113 Ma) were deposited inboard and thinly on top of the high, which is interpreted to represent the embryonic ridge18. The favoured plate reconstructions show a relatively simple breakup (e.g. Movie S4). These reconstructions are significantly different to the models of Refs.24,28 where large amounts of trans-continental shearing are required in order to fit plates which remain attached for another 10 My, until the end of salt deposition. This shear movement is speculative, we believe resulting from an erroneous breakup age.  9   Figure S1. Depth of the syn-rift sediment surface at time of breakup, 123 Ma, for representative models in the accompanying article (Models Base, MA and Fdd15o, Fig.1a) plus additional models where the stratigraphic match is less than perfect.   10     Figure S2. Graphs comparing subsidence histories of a 131 million year old surface (base of rift) for the models shown in Figure S1 at a position 40 km inboard of the breakup point. The grey bar indicates the thickness of syn-rift sediment at the time of breakup. Differences between the grey bar and a specific subsidence line at 123 Ma represents the water depth (unfilled accommodation space). Palaeobathymetric evidence of contemporaneous erosion and subsequent shallow water sag and salt deposits in the central South Atlantic region is contradicted where the water depth is significant (>500 m).    11  Figure S3. 2D pre-stack depth migrated seismic section from northern Kwanza Basin, offshore Angola, including the interpretation used as input for modeling of a non-volcanic rifted margin reported both here and in the accompanying article. Data is courtesy of ION GeoVentures (CongoSpan Seismic Line 2400). The field of view is 330 km (horizontal) by 40 km (vertical): the scales shown are in metres. West is on the left-hand (ocean) side of the section, east on the right (continent). Solid lines are the interpreted horizons used in TecMod, excluding indicative faults shown in red. Dashed dark blue lines indicate that flat layers within the sag progressively step (lap) onto the erosional surface at the top of the syn-rift interval (light blue line). The black dotted line indicates the base of crust which is an output from one of our final models (Fdd15o), its position correlating with the strong reflections generally interpreted to mark the Moho. The data was originally interpreted in Petrel 2016 and then exported as an image to Adobe Illustrator CC 2015 where the horizons were redrawn. The interpretation was then imported into TecMod as an SVG file to carry out the modeling. Brown horizon – seabed, 0 Ma; pink horizon – top salt (pre-salt diapir geometry), 113 Ma; purple horizon – base salt/top sag, 117 Ma; blue horizon – base sag/top syn-rift, 123 Ma; orange horizon – base syn-rift/top basement, 131 Ma. Oceanic crust starts at the outer volcanic high which we interpret to be a proto-oceanic ridge formed at the time of breakup, 123 Ma. The inset map shows the location of the section (red line). The same section is shown in Figs. 5 and 7 in Ref.10 as well as others noted in the same reference.  12   13  Figure S4.

As shown in Figure 1, debriscan become embedded within glacial ice by variousmechanisms, including rock wall collapse and wind-blownparticles within the snow accumulation zone. As the glacierflows into the ablation zone, the buried debris is liberated bythe gradual melting of the overlying ice and contributes tothe surface debris layer (e.g. Stokes and others, 2007). Ifenough debris cover is created, it can significantly affect theinteraction between the glacial ice and the atmosphere (e.g.by changing the surface albedo and insulation effects).Despite the debris layer’s importance to the energy balanceof a glacier, there are still many uncertainties regarding theunderlying physical processes (Collier and others, 2014). Itis the purpose of this paper to help close this gap andthereby offer insight into the relationship between glacialdebris cover and glacial melt rates.Field studies of debris-covered glaciers have revealedmany of the important mechanisms that contribute to theenergy flux balance, and these have allowed melt-ratecomputations to be conducted (e.g. Benn and Evans, 2010).However, a disparity appears to exist between currentmodel predictions and field observations. Existing modelsof glaciers that are fully covered by debris predict that theirmelt rate decreases monotonically with increasing debristhickness (e.g. Nicholson and Benn, 2006). Yet the well-known experimentally measured Østrem curve (Østrem,1959), which plots melt rates against debris thickness(Fig. 2), shows that a thickening of the debris layer caninitially enhance melting up to a critical depth, after whichthe melt rate decreases due to insulation effects (Reid andothers, 2012). Reid and Brock (2010) noted this discrep-ancy within their debris energy-balance model (whichassumed perfect debris coverage) stating that ‘there is nosign that [the melt rate] reaches a maximum and thendecreases [. . .] as the debris thickness tends to zero’. Theyargue that the disparity may be due to the ‘patchiness’ ofdebris cover for thin non-uniform debris layers, wherebythe melt rate increases as the proportion of glacier that isdebris-covered increases. Whilst the patchiness of thedebris cover certainly affects the rising limb of the Østremcurve, experiments show that it can still be produced onfully covered ice (e.g. Adhikary and others, 2000). Currenttheoretical models lack a mechanism that could account forthis discrepancy.The present paper builds upon previous theoreticalmodels, primarily by Bozhinskiy and others (1986),Nicholson and Benn (2006) and Reid and Brock (2010),but incorporates the important fact that glacial debris isporous (Nicholson and Benn, 2012), thus allowing air toflow through the debris layer. This enables our model totake account of the heat energy exchange between themoving air and the ice at the bottom of the debris layer. Theairflow within the debris layer is heavily attenuated withdepth (Beavers and Joseph, 1967), causing the energyexchange between the moving air and underlying ice (andhence energy available for evaporation) to diminish rapidlyJournal of Glaciology, Vol. 61, No. 229, 2015 doi: 10.3189/2015JoG14J235 825as the debris layer thickens. It is this reduction in (latent)energy to evaporation that is presented, and quantified, as apotential cause for the increasing melt rate in the Østremcurve for uniformly covered glaciers.The outline of the paper is as follows. We start byexamining the energy balance of a debris-covered glacier,paying particular attention to the dependence of theevaporative heat flux on the debris-layer thickness. Weuse the energy-balance equations to derive an explicitprediction of the glacier’s melt rate for the case of a spatiallyuniform, continuous debris cover and then extend themodel to the case of patchy debris cover. We show that ourpredictions for the melt rate agree well with experimentaldata obtained by Nicholson and Benn (2006), and thenstudy the effect of various physical quantities on thedevelopment of the maximum in the Østrem curve. Finally,we demonstrate how the meltout of debris particles from theglacier contributes to the thickness of the debris layer, andshow that this has a strong effect on the long-term evolutionof the glacier.THE MODEL PROBLEM AND ENERGYCONSIDERATIONSThe model configuration is shown in the schematic diagramof Figure 3, where we consider a small section of a debris-laden glacier. We denote the volume (packing) fraction ofsolid debris within the porous debris layer by ’, and thevolume fraction of debris embedded in the ice by �. The ice/debris interface is located at z ¼ h, where z is measuredpositive downwards, with z ¼ 0 indicating the initial pos-ition of the ice surface. The interface between the debrislayer and the atmosphere is located at z ¼ s, so that thedebris thickness is h   s. Both h and s will, in general, varyover different horizontal locations on the glacier. Assumingthat these variations are sufficiently gentle at a local scale(i.e. within the small glacial section of interest), we neglectsuch spatial dependence in our analysis and assume that hand s are functions of time, t, only. Of course, this may affectthe absolute value of the melt rate, but the approximationsignificantly simplifies the analysis and will not underminethe principle of the processes to be discussed here.The main aim of this paper is to determine the rate ofmelting of glacial ice. To determine this it is necessary tostudy the energy fluxes at z ¼ s and z ¼ h and to evaluatethe temperature, T (°C), throughout the debris layer. For thesake of clarity it will be assumed that the ice layer underinvestigation is at the melting point, T ¼ 0�C. This impliesthere is no heat flux into the ice across its surface at z ¼ h.For simplicity we neglect energy input due to precipitationand condensation (we explore this further in the Discussionsection). We also assume that all meltwater that is notevaporated runs off without pooling and does not influencethe energy exchange processes. Similar assumptions aremade by Bozhinskiy and others (1986), Nicholson and Benn(2006), Reid and Brock (2010) and Lejeune and others(2013), although the latter does include a snow layeroverlying the top of the debris surface. The energy flux in thesystem then has the following components:Shortwave energy fluxDuring daylight hours, there is shortwave solar irradia-tion of the glacier. It is assumed that throughout the dayFig. 2. A selection of measured Østrem curves, showing ice meltrates versus debris thickness. This figure is taken from Mattson andothers (1993).Fig. 1. A schematic diagram showing some of the processes bywhich debris can become embedded and transported within (andupon) a mountain glacier, causing the debris content of the glaciersurface to increase towards the snout.Fig. 3. Schematic diagram of a portion of a debris-laden and debris-covered glacier.Evatt and others: Glacial melt under a debris layer826the incoming shortwave radiation reaches the surface atan average rate of Q (Wm  2), which will vary with time;however, a certain fraction, �, is reflected back into theatmosphere. The parameter � (the albedo) depends uponthe material in question (and could vary with moisture)and we denote the broadband albedo of debris and bareice by �d and �i, respectively. Thus, for a section ofglacier completely covered by debris, the shortwaveenergy flux supplied to the debris layer isQS ¼ ð1   �dÞQ: ð1ÞLongwave energy fluxThe debris layer emits longwave radiation, whichincreases with its surface temperature, Tðz ¼ sÞ, via theStefan–Boltzmann law: �ðT þ TÞ4, where � is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant and T is 273 K. In practice, theemitted longwave energy flux depends on the thermalemissivity, �, of the debris (i.e. its ability to emit radiationcompared with a perfect black body at the sametemperature). This outgoing radiation is offset by acomponent I� (Wm  2), comprised of incoming long-wave radiation from the atmosphere (e.g. overlyingcloud layers and air particles (Liston and others,1999)). This implies that the total longwave energy fluxto the debris layer isQL ¼ I�   �� T þ TðsÞ  �4: ð2ÞSensible heat fluxThe sensible heat flux at the upper debris surfacerepresents the rate at which thermal energy is transferredacross the surface from the air and into the debris layer.The (downwards) vertical flux of sensible heat, QSH, atthat location depends upon the temperature gradient ofthe air at the debris surface (z ¼ s) and can bemodelled asQSH ¼   Kh�aca@T@z����z¼s, ð3Þwhere ca is the specific heat of air, �a is the air density andKh is the eddy diffusivity for heat (assuming that heattransfer is dominated by turbulent mixing rather thanmolecular diffusion).Heat flux due to evaporation at the ice surfaceSpatial variations in the absolute humidity, q (the mass ofwater vapour per unit volume of air), result in a diffusive(mass) flux of water vapour at a rate that is proportionalto its gradient, @q=@z. Assuming again that this diffusivetransport process is dominated by turbulent mixing, themass flux of vapour is given by   Kw@q=@z where Kw isthe eddy diffusivity for water vapour. At the ice surface,this mass flux is balanced by the creation of watervapour via evaporation, a process that extracts energyfrom the system at a rateQV ¼ KwLv@q@z����z¼h, ð4Þwhere Lv is the latent heat of evaporation. Thedimensions of QV are the same as those of a heat flux(Wm  2), therefore we refer to it as the evaporative heatflux (also known as the latent heat flux).Latent heat of meltingThe energy flux required to melt (pure) ice at a rate dh=dtis given by Lm�i dh=dt, where Lm is the latent heat ofmelting and �i is the density of the ice. For a glacier withdebris volume fraction �, the flux of energy, QM,required to melt the glacier at the same rate is thereforegiven byQM ¼ ð1   �Þ�iLmdhdt����z¼h: ð5ÞHeat flux within the debris layerThe debris layer is a randomly distributed air-filledporous medium, which, for ease of analysis in this paper,will have its thermal properties represented by a singleconductivity, k, which should be a suitably averagedmixture of the thermal conductivities of rock(s), moistureand air that comprise the layer. Consequently, the debrismantle’s heat flux automatically takes account of thesensible heat exchange between rock and air within thedebris. The heat flux downwards through the debris isthen given by Fourier’s lawQD ¼   k@T@z, ð6Þwhich also holds at both the upper and lower debrissurfaces. Note that, for convenience, we have assumedthat k has no spatial variation. Conservation of energywithin the debris layer then implies that the temperaturedistribution is governed by the heat equation@T@t¼ �@2T@z2, ð7Þwhere � ¼ k=ð�dcdÞ is the thermal diffusivity, expressedin terms of the debris layer’s average density, �d, and itsaverage specific heat, cd. Since our interest is thedevelopment of the debris layer over a long time, it isreasonable to assume that the melt rate is slow enoughfor daily fluctuations in the temperature to be averagedout, allowing us to neglect the time-derivative in Eqn (7).The temperature distribution in the debris layer is thengoverned by the steady heat equation,�@2T@z2¼ 0: ð8ÞWith these energy fluxes, the energy balance at the upperand lower surfaces of the debris layer can now be written.Assuming that the ice is perfectly covered by debris (anassumption we later relax), the energy balance at the top ofthe debris surface (at z ¼ s) isQD ¼ QSH þQS þQL, ð9Þand at the bottom surface of the debris cover, where itmakes contact with the ice (at z ¼ h), we haveQD ¼ QM þQV: ð10ÞWe stress that these energy fluxes also form the basis ofmany other theoretical models of glacial melting (Cuffey andPaterson (2010) provide a discussion in the context of cleanice; Nicholson and Benn (2006) and Reid and Brock (2010)discuss the case of debris-covered glaciers). However, thenovel feature of our model is that the evaporative heat flux,QV, is evaluated at the bottom of the debris layer, which iswhere the melting takes place. The fact that this makes QVdependent upon the wind dynamics within the debris layerwill turn out to be a key feature that allows us to explain themaximum in the Østrem curve.Evatt and others: Glacial melt under a debris layer 827DETERMINATION OF THE SENSIBLE ANDEVAPORATIVE HEAT FLUXESTo make further progress, it is necessary to derive expres-sions for the sensible and evaporative heat fluxes, QSH andQV, in terms of quantities that are, at least in principle, easyto measure (Garratt, 1992). A key element for the forth-coming discussion will be the turbulent flow of air both inthe atmosphere above the debris and in the debris layeritself. The model will partition these distinct flow regions,and the height z ¼ r (where r < s) denotes the separation, orswitching, surface between the two (see Fig. 4). That is, forz < r it is assumed that the wind-speed profile resembles theusual turbulent boundary layer flow over a surface, whereasfor z > r the wind-speed profile is dominated by the debrisproperties and so a porous flow model must be employed(Brutsaert (1982), gives an analysis of the related problem offlow through canopies and vegetation). The height,s   r ¼ xr, say, can be thought of as an effective surfaceroughness length scale (Fig. 3), which is related to theaverage particle size and packing configuration of the debrisat the top surface of the layer.Evaporative heat fluxAs stated in Eqn (4), the evaporative heat flux, QV, isdetermined by the humidity gradient in the air and the eddydiffusivity of water vapour, Kw. Since the flux of watervapour must be conserved throughout the system, the spatialvariation in humidity, q, is governed by the diffusionequation@@zKw@q@z� �¼ 0, ð11Þwhere we have again assumed that the timescales involvedare sufficiently slow for time-derivatives to be neglected. Tosolve this equation within the atmosphere and the porousdebris layer, appropriate forms for Kw are required in eachregion. To simplify matters, it is reasonable to assume thatthe eddy diffusivity, Kw (i.e. the rate at which vapourdisperses), is the same as the eddy viscosity of the air, K say(i.e. the rate at which momentum disperses). Thus, the ratioKw=K, which resembles an eddy Prandtl number, is taken asunity in both regions (Cuffey and Paterson, 2010). The eddyviscosity is defined by the relation� ¼   �aK@u@z, ð12Þwhere � is a turbulent shear stress and u is the meanhorizontal wind speed at height z. It can be expected thatthe variation of u and � with z will be quite different withinthe debris mantle or above it in the atmosphere. In order todetermine � and u it is necessary to postulate the fluidmechanical behaviour in each region.In the atmosphere above the surface roughness heightz ¼ r it is possible to follow the approach employed by,among others, Cuffey and Paterson (2010), who assume thatthe flow within the atmospheric dynamic sublayer obeys theclassical log-law velocity profile (e.g. Landau and Lifshitz,1987)uðzÞ ¼u�k�lns   zxr� �þ ur, ð13Þwith a constant turbulent shear stress� ¼ u2��a, ð14Þwhere u� is a constant friction velocity and k� is the vonKármán constant. Substitution into Eqn (12) gives theatmospheric eddy viscosity asK ¼ u�k�ðs   zÞ: ð15ÞCrucially, Eqn (13) introduces a nonzero slip velocity, ur, atthe switching surface z ¼ r, which we will match to the flowwithin the debris. While the slip velocity is, in principle, yetanother parameter that has to be measured, Landau andLifshitz (1987) state that the slip velocity is equal to thefriction velocity multiplied by a ‘constant of the order ofunity’. For simplicity we will therefore assume that ur � u�.We note that in many previous studies where the porosity ofthe debris layer was neglected (e.g. Nicholson and Benn,2006), the slip velocity was set to zero. While this only has asmall effect on the velocity field at sufficiently largedistances above the debris surface (i.e. for s   z� xr), urcannot be neglected close to the debris surface (i.e. whenthe distance becomes comparable with the roughnessheight, xr). In fact, it is important to note that a nonzeroslip velocity is a feature of any turbulent flow above a roughsurface, whether porous or not (Spurk and Aksel, 2008); weshall make use of this when we consider the melting of abare-ice surface.Within the debris layer, it can be expected that the windspeed is heavily attenuated with depth. Analogies to thepresent model occur in many other porous media flowmodels, such as wind flow through crops. Brutsaert (1982)provides a detailed description of such similar models,which themselves are based on general physical principlesfrom dimensional analysis, and are therefore appropriate to awide range of porous media. In particular, Brutsaert presentstwo assumptions by which � and u can be determinedexplicitly. These assumptions are (1) that flow within theporous layer is given by the momentum-balance equation@�@zþ12ACD�au2 ¼ 0, ð16Þwhere A is the average ratio of a debris particle’s surfacearea to the volume of air (1   ’) in the debris layer, and CDis the drag coefficient on a typical debris particle; and(2) that the flow is turbulent with a constant mixing length,Fig. 4. Schematic diagram of the wind-speed profile above, andwithin, a debris layer. At any depth, z ¼ h, within the porous flowregion, the overlying debris depth is h   s. In the atmosphericregion the wind speed can be thought of as obeying a logarithmicflow profile and in the porous region it obeys an exponential decayprofile (Brutsaert, 1982).Evatt and others: Glacial melt under a debris layer828xd, implyingK ¼   x2d@u@z��������: ð17ÞBy solving the coupled Eqns (12), (16) and (17), andensuring continuity of wind speed across the switchingsurface, z ¼ r, it can be shown thatu ¼ ure  �ðz  rÞ, ð18Þ� ¼ �aðxd�urÞ2e  2�ðz  rÞ, ð19ÞK ¼ x2d�ure  �ðz  rÞ, ð20Þfor z � r, where� ¼ACD4x2d !1=3: ð21ÞFinally, it is necessary to determine the mixing length, xd,which is obtained by satisfying continuity of shear stressacross z ¼ r:xd ¼4ACDu�ur� �3: ð22ÞThe above relation allows � to be written in the moreconvenient form� ¼ACD4uru�� �2�ACD4, ð23Þwhere the final approximation follows from our assumptionthat ur � u�. These descriptions for � , u and K confirm twoimportant empirical observations: horizontal wind speedwithin a porous medium decays exponentially with depth(Brutsaert, 1982), and evaporative heat transfer is propor-tional to wind speed (because K, and hence Kw, is directlyproportional to u) (Cuffey and Paterson, 2010). The fact thatthis derivation confirms these observations is encouraging,although clearly heuristic arguments could have beenemployed from the outset without having to involve mixinglength theory. But what the present derivation provides,which an observational approach does not, is a quantifiablelink between debris geometry (captured by A and CD) andthe exponential decay rate, �, of the wind speed. That said,it is clear that in practice, debris geometry, drag and packingfraction will be difficult to measure, and thus A and CD willbe extremely hard to determine robustly. Thus, it mayactually be easier to employ direct values for � found byexperiment, supported by the knowledge that there is aphysical justification for doing so.With expressions for Kw ¼ KðzÞ derived in bothregions (Eqns (15) and (20)), it is now possible to determinethe humidity, qðzÞ, via Eqn (11). This, in turn, enables thesimple step of calculating the evaporative heat flux at the icesurface (z ¼ h) from Eqn (4). To solve Eqn (11) in the tworegions, four boundary conditions for q are needed. First,continuity of humidity and vapour flux, respectively, at theswitching surface require that½qðzÞ�þ  ¼ 0 on z ¼ r, ð24ÞK@q@z� �þ ¼ 0 on z ¼ r, ð25Þwhere ½:�þ  denotes the difference in the given quantity eitherside of a boundary. Next, the humidity level at the ice/debrisinterface is taken to be that for saturated air, qh,q ¼ qh on z ¼ h, ð26Þwhich is justified by the melting conditions at the icesurface. We further assume that measurements at z ¼ m,which is at a height xm above the mean surface of the debrislayer, z ¼ s, have determined the humidity level and windspeed as qm and um, respectively, i.e.q ¼ qm and u ¼ um on z ¼ m ¼ s   xm: ð27ÞSolving for q in Eqn (11) is straightforward, and the vapourflux within the debris layer can be written asKðzÞ@q@z¼qh   qmð Þu2�k�u�ln xm=xrð Þ þ urk� e�ðh  rÞ   1½ �, ð28Þin which Eqns (22) and (23) have been used to eliminate xd.With some slight rearrangement and use of Eqns (13) and(18), this result yields the evaporative heat flux (Eqn (4)) atthe ice/debris interface asQVðhÞ ¼Lv qh   qmð Þu2�uðhÞ½ðum   2urÞuðhÞ þ u2r �: ð29ÞThe presence of the ice surface wind speed, uðhÞ, withinEqn (29) means that this energy flux will rapidly tend to zeroas the debris depth increases, thereby offering a mechanismby which the Østrem curve can be reproduced.It is of note that one can transform the above equation, interms of absolute humidity, to one in terms of another watervapour measure (e.g. specific humidity, relative humidity orwater vapour pressure).Sensible heat fluxThe flux of sensible heat may be treated in a similar manner.Fortunately its value is required only at the debris/atmosphere interface, where it interacts with the overlyingatmosphere. The flux of sensible heat is again taken asquasi-steady, implying@@zKh@T@z� �¼ 0, ð30Þand Kh, the eddy diffusivity of heat, is taken to be the eddyviscosity, K, i.e. the eddy Prandtl number is again assumedto be unity. In the surface roughness region, r < z < s, thediffusivity is given by Eqn (20), whereas above this, in z < r,it takes the linear profile given by Eqn (15). Hence Eqn (30)may be integrated, ensuring continuity of temperature andheat flux across z ¼ r, to yieldQSH ¼�acau2�ðTm   TðsÞÞum þ ðe�xr   2Þur, ð31Þwhere Tm is the temperature measured at z ¼ m.Note that if we were to set the slip velocity, ur, to zerothen the wind speed throughout the debris layer vanishes.

For thispurpose we split the spatially one-dimensional model ofdebris-covered ice shown in Figure 1 into three regions: theatmosphere, the debris and the ice. The debris-layer depth,h   s, can be determined by consideration of the rate atwhich it grows due to the fraction of debris (e.g. rocks, silt orsand), �, liberated as the ice melts, and any supraglacialsource terms of debris, g (e.g. via rock avalanches or theaddition or loss of wind-blown particles so that g can bepositive or negative). Thus, as the ice melts at a rate dh=dt, itcreates additional debris at the rate � dh=dt and hence thepile grows at the rate �=’ dh=dt due to the debris packingfraction, ’. Similarly, the supraglacial debris depositionleads to an additional debris-pile growth rate of g=’, andhence the debris-layer growth equation isddtðhðtÞ   sðtÞÞ ¼dhdtðtÞ�’þg’: ð33ÞIf we assume, for simplicity, that �, g and ’ are locallyconstant then Eqn (33) can be integrated to give theinstantaneous position of the debris surface level assðtÞ ¼ hðtÞð1   �=’Þ   gt=’   d0, ð34Þwhere   d0 is the initial position of the debris surface (at timet ¼ 0) as hð0Þ ¼ 0, and therefore the initial debris thicknessis d0. We shall take d0 ¼ 0 in what follows, but will assumethat the glacier has an initial debris cover that, althoughinfinitesimally thin, perfectly covers the ice. Hence, theglacier’s surface albedo remains a constant, �d, for all time;however, in the following subsection we extend the modelto allow the glacier to have an initially bare-ice surface.The temperature distribution in the debris layer (forsðtÞ < z < hðtÞ) is governed by the steady heat equation,Eqn (8), subject to boundary conditions for the temperature,T ¼ 0 on z ¼ hðtÞ, ð35Þthe energy flux balance at the ice/debris interface,  k@T@z���� ¼ ð1   �Þ�iLmdhdtþQv on z ¼ hðtÞ, ð36Þwhere QV is given by Eqn (29), and the energy flux balanceat the atmosphere/debris interface  k@T@z����þ¼QSH þ I�  ��ðT þ TÞ4 þQð1   �dÞ on z ¼ sðtÞ,ð37ÞwhereQSH is given by Eqn (31). The þ=  subscript indicatesthe limiting value of the specified quantity as s is ap-proached from below/above respectively. Equations (8–37)constitute a free-boundary problem – a so-called ‘Stefanproblem’ – whose solution determines the melt rate and theevolution of the debris-layer thickness.Integration of the steady heat equation (Eqn (8)), subjectto the temperate ice condition (Eqn (35)) at the lowerinterface, z ¼ hðtÞ, yields the temperature distribution withinthe debrisTðzÞ ¼ TðsÞðh   zÞðh   sÞ: ð38ÞTo make further progress, we assume that the variations intemperature at the debris surface are sufficiently small(compared with T ¼ 273K) to allow the longwave radiationterm, Eqn (2), to be linearized in T. This simplifies theanalysis but does not qualitatively alter the results. Employ-ing the derived expressions for the evaporative heat flux,QV, at the ice surface, Eqn (29), and the sensible heat flux,QSH at the upper surface of the debris layer, Eqn (31), theboundary conditions Eqns (36) and (37) reduce toð1   �Þ�iLmdhdt¼   k@T@z ð1   �Þ�iLm�11þ �2e  �ðh  sÞ� �e  �ðh  sÞ ð39Þon z ¼ hðtÞ, and  k@T@z¼ ð1   �Þ�iLm�1   k�2T ð40Þon z ¼ sðtÞ, where the constants are defined as�1 ¼I�   ��T4 þQð1   �dÞ þ �Tmð1   �Þ�iLm, ð41Þ�2 ¼� þ 4��T3k, ð42Þ� ¼�acau2�um   urð2   e�xrÞ, ð43Þ�1 ¼Lvu2�ðqh   qmÞe  �xrð1   �Þ�iLmur, ð44Þand�2 ¼ðum   2urÞe  �xrur: ð45ÞBy construction, it is physically reasonable to assume that allof these constants take positive values whilst the ice ismelting.Differentiating Eqn (38) allows the heat flux to be writtenin terms of the temperature at the debris surface, TðsÞ. So, byeliminating TðsÞ between Eqns (39) and (40) it is straightfor-ward to show that the solution to this free-boundaryproblem is determined by the ice surface evolution equationdhdt¼�11þ �2ðh   sÞ �1�2 þ e�ðh  sÞ, ð46Þin which the debris surface location, s, is given by Eqn (34).For completeness, the vertical debris temperature profile isTðzÞ ¼�iLmð1   �Þ�1ðh   zÞk 1þ �2ðh   sÞ½ �: ð47ÞThe original Stefan problem has thus been reduced to thesimple nonlinear first-order ordinary differential (Eqn (46))for hðtÞ as a function for time, solutions to which are readilycomputable. The debris-layer temperature may be solveddirectly from the linear Eqn (47), which does not rely on aspatial discretization. Most importantly, Eqn (46) showsclearly why the present model can produce a melt-ratecurve of the form measured by Østrem: the second term onthe right-hand side is associated with the energy loss due toevaporation and rapidly decays to zero as the debris-layerthickness (h   s) increases, thus increasing the melt rate (dueto the negative sign). However, as time progresses, the firstterm on the right-hand side also gets smaller, due toincreased insulation of the ice via the debris, therebyreducing the rate of melt from its peak. Thus, Eqn (46)appears to resolve a long-standing problem regardingdynamic ablation due to debris from ice. The modelEvatt and others: Glacial melt under a debris layer830includes new physical elements not used in previousstudies, yet is still easily solvable, and so it seems appropri-ate to term Eqn (46) the ‘dynamic ablation due to debrisfrom ice (DADDI) equation’.Modifications for thin, patchy debris coverSo far we have assumed that the debris layer is sufficientlythick to be able to form a spatially uniform covering over theice. This assumption is questionable during the very earlystages of the formation of the debris mantle, when thethickness of this layer is comparable to the typical grainwidth, 2xg, say. In this regime the debris cover is likely to bepatchy and we denote the fraction of the ice surface that isdebris-covered by, p, say. To determine this time-varying(and probabilistic) debris-coverage fraction, we have to makecertain assumptions about how the grains accumulate anddistribute (Kirkbride and Deline (2013) provide a discussionof this issue). We will assume that while the debris cover isincomplete, the debris arrives at the glacier surface to form alayer that is a single grain thick. After reaching completedebris coverage (p ¼ 1) we then assume that the debristhickness increases uniformly over the entire surface.For a (horizontal) unit area of ice, the total rate of increasein volume of the debris deposited from melting andsupraglacial sources is, from Eqn (33),dHdtðtÞ�’þg’, ð48Þwhere now dH=dt is the weighted average melt rate of bareand covered ice, i.e.dHdt¼ pðtÞdhdtþ 1   pðtÞð Þdbdt, ð49Þwhere b is the surface elevation of the bare-ice proportion(itself an average). The evolution equation for h is given byEqn (46) and b is found by substituting h ¼ s into Eqn (46) togivedbdt¼ �i1  �1�2 þ 1, ð50Þwhere �i1 is given by Eqn (41) but using the albedo of ice, �i.We can finally close the system by integrating Eqn (48)(with initial condition Hð0Þ ¼ 0) to get the accumulatedvolume of debris in a unit area of ice, and hence dividing bythe average grain size yields the surface debris fractionpðtÞ ¼ min 1,�Hþ gt2’xg� �: ð51ÞThe numerical solution of Eqn (49) is straightforward, using pfrom Eqn (51), h from Eqn (46) and b from Eqn (50). Giventhis model’s relation to the DADDI (Eqn (46)) and its con-sideration of bare ice, we term Eqn (49) the DADDI-BAREequation.RESULTSTo illustrate the capabilities of our model, we start bycomparing the instantaneous melt rate predicted by Eqn (46)with field measurements obtained by Nicholson and Benn(2006) on Larsbreen, Svalbard. The parameter values ofNicholson and Benn (2006) are listed in Table 1, whichthemselves are 24 hour means from a dry debris layer. Wechoose to apply these particular parameter values to ourmodel as they provide, to the best of our knowledge, themost comprehensive parameter set yet published. In doingso, they leave us to specify only two remaining parametervalues, both of which arise out of the novel aspects of ourown modelling: the volume fraction of debris in the ice, �,and the wind-speed attenuation constant, �. The former onlyhas a small effect on the instantaneous melt rate (but seeFig. 10 for an illustration of how variations in � affect aglacier’s long-term evolution) and was set to 1%. A value for� can be obtained via estimates for the parameters A and CDwhich feature in Eqn (23). The parameter A is the averageratio of the debris surface area to the volume of air in thedebris layer. We can obtain a rough estimate of this quantityby assuming that the debris is composed of identical spheresof radius xg (the typical grain size) and packed into a body-centred cubic arrangement with volume fraction ’. It is thenstraightforward to show that A is given byA ¼3’xgð1   ’Þ, ð52Þwhich yields A ¼ 188m  1 for a grain radius of xg ¼ 4mm.To estimate the drag coefficient, CD, we use data fromReddy and Joshi (2008), who performed experiments onflow through a rigid body-centred cubic arrangement ofspheres over a range of Reynolds numbers and packingfractions. For the parameter regime of interest here, CD � 5,which yields the estimate � ¼ 234m  1. We note that thedependence of A (and thus, via Eqn (23), also �) on xg inEqn (52) is consistent with the empirical findings of Harrisand Pedersen (1998), who showed that wind can transferheat energy through large blocky debris (larger xg thussmaller �) much more easily than it can through fine-grained material (smaller xg thus larger �). Our estimate for �is nevertheless very crude and any attempt to directlymeasure this quantity in field experiments (e.g. by fittingthe exponentially decaying profile, Eqn (18), to theflow speed measured within the debris layer, usingTable 1.

The figurealso shows the predictions from Nicholson and Benn’s owncomputations (dash-dotted curve), in which the time-derivative in the diffusion equation (Eqn (7)) for thetemperature was retained. The agreement between the threedatasets indicates that our quasi-steady model, which isbased on time-averaged heat fluxes and a homogenizeddebris layer, adequately describes the melt process. Thefigure also shows that the presence of a thin debris layerincreases the melt rate above that of clean ice (shown by thedashed line), because the debris layer has a smaller albedothan clean ice and therefore absorbs a larger fraction of theincoming shortwave radiation. Neither of the datasets showsany evidence of a maximum in the melt rate at small debris-layer thicknesses, suggesting that in this particular parameterregime the evaporative heat flux is small and only plays aminor role in the overall energy balance. The shape of thatcurve is therefore determined predominantly by the insulat-ing effect of the debris layer, resulting in a continuousdecrease in the melt rate with an increase in debris-layerthickness. The only effect of the evaporative heat flux is theslight reduction in the slope of the melt-rate curve for verysmall debris-layer thicknesses.Figure 6 shows a plot of the temperature, TðsÞ, at the topof the debris layer versus thickness of the debris layer. Thefigure shows that the surface temperature initially increasesrapidly with the debris-layer thickness, before ultimatelyapproaching an asymptotic limit of �14.6°C. This value,which is indicated by the dashed line, may be obtained bytaking the limit of Eqn (47) for large values of h   s.Physically, the limit corresponds to the situation in whichthe debris layer has become thick enough for heatconduction into the debris to have become negligible, sothat the surface temperature is simply determined by theenergy balance between shortwave and longwave energies,and the sensible heat flux.Evaporation is driven by humidity gradients (Eqn (4)),therefore the relative importance of the evaporative heat fluxon the overall energy balance depends strongly on theatmospheric humidity, qm. This is illustrated in Figure 7b,which shows that a decrease in qm (from 0.74qh to 0.5qhand 0.25qh while keeping all other parameters constant)increases the evaporative heat flux, Qv, significantly. Theassociated reduction in the amount of energy available formelting results in a noticeable decrease in the melt rate(Fig. 7a). This implies that the reduction in Qv caused by anincrease in debris-layer thickness now has an appreciableeffect on the energy balance, and manifests itself in theclearly defined maximum in the Østrem curve at modestdebris-layer thicknesses. The maximum in the melt ratearises for debris-layer thicknesses of the order of a fewcentimetres, consistent with the field measurements shownin Figure 2.Figure 8 illustrates the effect of variations in the attenu-ation coefficient, �, which is a key parameter in our model.Here the reference � (234m  1) is varied by �33%. Anincrease in � corresponds to an increase in the dragexperienced by the flow in the porous debris layer(Eqn (23)) and therefore reduces the wind speed at the icesurface. The associated reduction in the evaporative heatflux, shown in Figure 8b, again increases the amount ofenergy available for melting and therefore increases the meltrate (Fig. 8a). Interestingly, the maximum in the melt-ratecurve only develops for sufficiently large values of �. Toexplain this we note that the debris-layer depth beyondwhich the evaporative heat flux becomes so small that itonly plays a minor role in the overall energy balancedecreases with increasing �. An increase in � thereforeincreases the initial slopes of the curves in Figure 8b, whichrepresent the rate at which an increase in the debris-layerFig. 6. Plot of temperature at the top of the debris layer, TðsÞ, as afunction of the debris-layer thickness, for the parameter values inTable 1. The dashed line shows the theoretical limit for an infinitelythick debris layer.Fig. 5. Instantaneous melt rate plotted against debris-layer thick-ness, with parameters from Table 1. Solid curve: the Østrem curvepredicted by the DADDI equation (Eqn (46)) (at the y-intercept, thedebris layer is assumed infinitesimally thin); square markers:Nicholson and Benn (2006) field measurements; dash-dotted curve:spline fit to predictions from Nicholson and Benn’s (2006)computational model; dashed line: melt rate for bare ice fromEqn (50).Evatt and others: Glacial melt under a debris layer832depth reduces the evaporative heat flux, Qv. The maximumin the melt-rate curve develops only for values of � forwhich the rate at whichQv decreases with an increase in thedebris-layer thickness outweighs the reduction in the meltrate due the concomitant increase in the insulating effect ofthe debris layer. See the Appendix for a more detailedanalysis of the conditions under which the turning point inthe Østrem curve arises.The results presented so far were obtained from Eqn (46),which is based on the assumption that the debris coverremains continuous as its thickness approaches zero. Thisassumption implies that the melt rate for a (nominally) zerodebris-layer thickness exceeds that of bare ice (see, e.g.,Fig. 5), because the albedo of the debris is lower than that ofthe bare-ice surface. (All other effects associated with thepresence of the debris layer vanish as the layer thicknessgoes to zero.) As discussed above, this is clearly an artefactof the model, since it ignores the fact that very thin debrislayers are inevitably patchy and thus provide only a partialcover to the underlying ice. Figure 9 shows the melt ratepredicted by our revised model, Eqn (49), which offers asimple way to incorporate the transition from bare ice tocomplete debris cover in the model. The three curves in thefigure show the instantaneous melt rate as a function of thedebris-layer thickness for different values of the debrisalbedo, �d, which increases in the direction of the arrow(�d ¼ 0:07, 0.24, 0.4). The humidity was set to qm ¼ 0:5qh,the value for which the original model predicts a turningpoint in the melt-rate curve (Fig. 7) due to the reduction ofthe evaporative heat flux with increasing debris-layerthickness. The topmost curve in Figure 9 shows the meltrate for �d ¼ 0:07, which is the value used in the previouscomputations. For a sufficiently thick debris layer (for whichwe assume the debris cover to be continuous), the melt ratetherefore agrees with that already shown in Figure 7. Oncethe debris-layer thickness drops below the average grainwidth, 2xg (8mm), the reduction in the debris coverage, p(modelled crudely by Eqn (51)), reduces the overall short-wave energy input and thus reduces the average melt rateuntil, for zero debris-layer thickness, it reaches that of bareFig. 7. (a) Instantaneous melt rate and (b) evaporative heat flux,plotted against debris-layer thickness, for different humidities(qm ¼ 0:74qh, 0.5qh and 0.25qh, decreasing in the direction ofthe arrow). Other parameters as in Table 1.Fig. 8. (a) Instantaneous melt rate and (b) evaporative heat flux,plotted against debris-layer thickness, for different values of theattenuation parameter (� ¼ 155, 234 and 311m  1, increasing inthe direction of the arrow) and qm ¼ 0:5qh. Other parameters as inTable 1.Evatt and others: Glacial melt under a debris layer 833ice. Patchiness therefore contributes to the maximum in theØstrem curve – a point also noticed by Reid and Brock(2010). The additional curves in Figure 9 show that itsimportance (relative to the reduction in evaporative heatflux) depends on the difference in the albedo of ice anddebris. If �i and �d are very similar (or if the incomingshortwave energy is small) the effect of partial debris coveron the melt rate is modest. This is shown by the bottommostcurve in Figure 9, where we set the debris albedo to that ofbare ice, �d ¼ �i ¼ 0:4. In this extreme case the maximumin the Østrem curve is entirely due to the variations in theevaporative heat flux with the debris-layer thickness, whilepatchiness only plays a very minor role.So far our discussion has focused on the dependence ofthe melt rate, dh=dt, on the instantaneous debris-layerthickness. To determine the total thickness of ice meltedover a given period of time, it is important to account for thefact that the meltout of debris particles that are embedded inthe ice leads to a continuous increase in the debris-layerthickness. Within our model, this effect is represented by thedependence of the melt rate on the volume fraction of debrisin the ice, �, via the parameters �1 and �1 (Eqns (41) and (44),respectively). Using a highly simplified, yet useful, assump-tion of constant energy fluxes, Figure 10 shows a plot of thethickness of ice melted as a function of time for threedifferent values of �: � ¼ 0 (clean ice), � ¼ 0:01 and � ¼ 0:1.The data were produced by time-integrating Eqn (46). Whilstthis estimate is not intended to reflect diurnal/annual effects,it does demonstrate that the depth of ice melted is clearlyvery sensitive to the debris volume fraction, confirming thatdebris content can have a dramatic effect on the lifespan ofice masses (Jansson and Fredin, 2002).DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONSWe have developed a simple model for determining themelt rate of a debris-laden glacier. Solutions to the model,given by Eqn (46), are able to capture the experimentallyobserved features of the Østrem curve, most notably theturning point in the melt rate for debris-layer thicknesses of afew centimetres (consistent with the observations shown inFig. 2). More specifically, model solutions are in closeagreement with field data from Nicholson and Benn (2006).Our model provides a simple explanation for theobserved increase in the melt rate for thin debris layers: asthe debris layer thickens (either via meltout of englacialdebris or supraglacial source terms), the wind speed at theice/debris interface decreases. This reduces the rate ofevaporation, which increases the energy available formelting. Once a sufficiently thick debris layer has beencreated, the wind speed at the ice/debris interface becomesnegligible, allowing the thermodynamics of the system tobecome dominated by the insulating effect of the debrislayer. A further increase in the thickness of the debris layerthen reduces the melt rate. For a sufficiently thin debrislayer, the patchiness of the debris cover makes an additionalcontribution to the maximum in the melt-rate curve, and weshowed that the relative importance of the two effectsdepends on the difference in the albedo of the ice and thedebris cover. Note that the results for the initial patchy phaseof the melting are rather dependent on the assumed form ofthe debris distribution, Eqn (51), and are a useful area forfuture investigation.The consideration of the debris layer’s porosity intro-duced a crucial new parameter, �, which appears explicitlywithin the DADDI equation (Eqn (46)). This parametercaptures the attenuation of the wind speed within the debrislayer and we estimated it to take a value of �234m  1 for theparameters listed in Table 1. We showed that theevaporative heat flux’s overall behaviour is fairly robust tovariations in �, although a 50% reduction in � was able tosuppress the turning point in the Østrem curve. It will beinteresting to assess its value in field experiments, particu-larly when measured against a variety of debris mediacompositions.The relative simplicity of our model allowed us toperform a detailed analysis of a small number of keyphysical effects, while neglecting a large number of others.Fig. 9.

Thickness of ice melted as a function of time for threedifferent values of the volume fraction of debris embedded in theice: � ¼ 0, 0.01 and 0.1, increasing in the direction of the arrow.Other parameters are as in Table 1.Evatt and others: Glacial melt under a debris layer834For instance, our model deliberately ignores a sub-zerotemperature distribution in the glacier, energy exchangewith rain and snow, the effect of refreezing moisture withinthe debris layer, spatial variations in the particle sizedistribution and capillary effects, to name but a few. Someof these effects could easily be incorporated into a morecomplex version of our model. For instance, in a fine-grained debris cover, capillary effects are likely to create athin, water-saturated layer of debris directly above the icesurface. The inclusion of this feature will require theevaluation of the evaporative heat flux at the (elevated)air/water interface. While this is likely to change the precisedetails of the model’s predictions, the main effect studied inthis paper, namely the increase in melt rate due to thereduction of wind speed within the non-saturated porousdebris layer above the saturated region, is likely to remain akey feature. Likewise, including a sub-zero ice temperature(i.e. a nonzero temperature gradient) is an easy extension tothe model, although, again, it would not have added muchinsight into the dynamics this paper focused on (and wouldhave been inconsistent with Nicholson and Benn, 2006).However, there exist other physical effects whoseinclusion will require a considerable amount of additionalmodelling. There are two such aspects we believe to beparticularly important. The first concerns the developmentof a more detailed description of the spatio-temporalevolution of the (highly inhomogeneous) debris layer.Methods that can appropriately take account of thiscomplexity and offer estimates of a debris layer’s time-and depth-varying thermal conductivity, and wind speedattenuation, will be desirable. Secondly, the time-varyingeffect of moisture (and its phase changes) within a debrislayer should be explored. Evidence of its importance hasbeen provided; for example, Brock and others (2010) andCollier and others (2014) measured a positive evaporativeheat flux over reasonably deep debris layers. This is incontrast to our dry debris-layer model, which assumed thesefluxes to be negligible. Both these future areas of work willrequire an array of mathematical models, field trials andlaboratory experiments to be implemented. In doing so, afuller quantitative understanding of a debris-covered gla-cier’s evolution could be produced, paving the way for moreaccurate glacier mass-balance forecasts.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThis paper is the result of a workshop held in Karthaus, Süd-Tirol, 3–9 June 2012.

Although the Østrem curve has a single interior(X > 0) turning point that is the maximum melt rate, it isnecessary to explore the possibility of multiple (or zero)local maxima and minima melt rates.

Clearly, gðXÞ is large and positiveas X ! �1, and thus interior turning points must exist, andone of them will be a global minimum. Differentiation ofgðXÞ reveals that there is one, and only one, turning point(minimum) atXmin ¼2�sinh  1ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi�2�1��1�2r� �þlnð�2Þ�, ðA2Þat which pointgðXminÞ ¼2���1�2�2�1þ 1� �1=2 1�2  Xmin: ðA3ÞSo, when gðXminÞ > 0, there will be no turning points ofEqn (46) and hence the melt-rate curve will be monotonicdecreasing in X � 0. In the case gðXminÞ ¼ 0 then there willbe a single (interior) maximum to the curve of dh=dt ifXmin > 0.When gðXminÞ < 0, the curve of gðXÞ crosses the X-axistwice; however, these crossings may occur for two positiveX values, a single positive X value, or for no positive Xvalues. To discern this number, it is necessary to find thepoint at which gð0Þ ¼ 0, i.e. when zero is a root of Eqn (A1):gð0Þ ¼ 2ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi�1�2��2�1rcoshlnð�2Þ2� � 1�2¼ 0: ðA4ÞA new parameter, JD, say, may be introduced asJD ¼��1ð1þ �2Þ2  �1�2, ðA5Þwhich can be rearranged from Eqn (A4) so that JD ¼ 0corresponds to gð0Þ ¼ 0. So, it is easy to conclude that twopositive roots occur if Xmin > 0 and gð0Þ > 0, and two non-positive roots when Xmin < 0 and gð0Þ > 0. Finally one, andonly one, positive root occurs at the parameter valuescorresponding to gð0Þ � 0. This may be summarized asfollows.Zero roots: the melt rate monotonically decreases for alldebris thicknesses. In this case the parameter valuessatisfy either:(1) gðXminÞ > 0, or(2) gðXminÞ � 0, Xmin � 0 and JD � 0.One root: the melt rate will qualitatively behave as theØstrem curve, with an interior maximum melt rateoccurring at a positive debris depth. In this case theconditions are(1) gðXminÞ ¼ 0, Xmin > 0, or(2) gðXminÞ < 0, and JD > 0.Two roots: The melt rate will have a local maximum andminimum (where Xmin < Xmax). The conditions for thisnovel scenario are given by gðXminÞ < 0, Xmin > 0 andJD < 0.It can be easily shown that JD is actually the slope of themelt-rate curve at X ¼ 0; thus, as the function dh=dt tends tozero for large debris thickness, there must be a maximum,and the above analysis has shown this to be a single turningpoint. When the initial slope is zero or negative, then forX > 0 it has been shown that there can be two, or zero,turning points. As a final point, it is a physical requirementof the system that the melt rate is always positive; thus, fromEqn (46) it is seen that the parameters obey the inequality�1ð1þ �2Þ > �1: ðA6ÞMS received 18 December 2014 and accepted in revised form 21 May 2015Evatt and others: Glacial melt under a debris layer836",Articles,"Moraines, Energy transfer, Glaciers, Geophysics, Hydrology",,'Columbia University Libraries/Information Services'

IntroductionThe formation and evolution of Earth, the terrestrial planets, Moons, and other cosmic objects in the solar system has been significantly influenced by hypervelocity impact processes. Depending on the impact condi-tions, large quantities of impact-induced melt and vapor are generated. In previous studies melt production in impact events has been quantified mainly by semi-analytical models (e.g., Cintala & Grieve, 1998; Croft, 1982; Grieve & Cintala, 1992, 1997; Tonks & Melosh, 1993), and computer simulations using shock physics codes (e.g., Artemieva, 2007; Artemieva & Lunine, 2005; Barr & Citron, 2011; Bjorkman & Holsapple, 1987; Davison et al., 2010; Moreau et al., 2018; Nakajima et al., 2021; O’Keefe & Ahrens, 1977; Pierazzo et al., 1997; Wünnemann et al., 2008). The focus in most studies lies on the main heating and melting mechanism upon impact cratering, the shock compression. The passage of a shock wave increases the pressure temporarily, but causes permanent changes in density, internal energy, and entropy, giving rise to melting (Melosh, 1989; Zel'dovich & Raizer, 1969). If the shock-induced gain in internal energy and entropy is in excess of a critical amount the material will start to melt instantaneously or, most often, upon decompression to the initial pressure, as solidus temperature is a function of pressure. For simplicity the critical energy for melting EM (e.g., Pierazzo et al., 1997) can be translated into a critical shock pressure for melting as end-member of the well-known progressive sequence of stages of shock metamorphism in rocks (e.g., Stöffler et al., 2018). In addition to shock compression, melting can also be Abstract Melting and vaporization of rocks in impact cratering is mostly attributed to be a consequence of shock compression. However, other mechanism such as plastic work and decompression by structural uplift also contribute to melt production. In this study we expand the commonly used method to determine shock-induced melting in numerical models from the peak shock pressure by a new approach to account for additional heating due plastic work and internal friction. We compare our new approach with the straight-forward method to simply quantify melting from the temperature relative to the solidus temperature at any arbitrary point in time in the course of crater formation. This much simpler method does account for plastic work but suffers from reduced accuracy due to numerical diffusion inherent to ongoing advection in impact crater formation models. We demonstrate that our new approach is more accurate than previous methods in particular for quantitative determination of impact melt distribution in final crater structures. In addition, we assess the contribution of plastic work to the overall melt volume and find, that melting is dominated by plastic work for impacts at velocities smaller than 7.5–12.5 km/s in rocks, depending on the material strength. At higher impact velocities shock compression is the dominating mechanism for melting. Here, the conventional peak shock pressure method provides similar results compared with our new model. Our method serves as a powerful tool to accurately determine impact-induced heating in particular at relatively low-velocity impacts.Plain Language Summary During the collision of cosmic bodies such as planets and asteroids on various scales, the involved material is heated such that melting or vaporization can occur. The vast amount of heat is considered to be generated during shock compression, however recent studies found that plastic deformation during decompression also contribute to the heating process. In this study, we introduce a new approach to quantify impact-induced melting more accurately under consideration of the latter heating mechanisms. We demonstrate that our approach is more accurate than previous attempts and quantify the contribution from plastic work on impact-induced melting. We systematically study the effect of impact velocity and material strength on melt production and find, that it is dominated by plastic work for impact velocities up to 7.5–12.5 km/s in rocks, depending on the material strength.MANSKE ET AL.© 2022 The Authors.This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited and is not used for commercial purposes.Quantification of Impact-Induced Melt Production in Numerical Modeling RevisitedLukas Manske1,2  , Kai Wünnemann1,2  , and Kosuke Kurosawa3 1Museum für Naturkunde Berlin, Leibniz Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity Science, Berlin, Germany, 2Department of Earth Sciences, Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany, 3Planetary Exploration Research Center, Chiba Institute of Technology, Narashino, JapanKey Points:•  We propose an improved method to quantify impact-induced melt production for rocks•  We quantify impact-induced melt production and separate between heating due to shock compression and plastic work•  Melting due to frictional heating (plastic work) dominates over shock melting for impact velocities below 7–13 km/s depending on strengthCorrespondence to:L.

Decompression melting is most relevant during large collision events in the early evolution of planetary bodies, which are thought to be initially much hotter than today giving rise to more efficient decompression melting. However, decompression does not contribute to the heat production by impact and, although our method is able to account for it (Manske et al., 2021), we neglect decompression melting here. The third melting mechanism upon impact is plastic work. Shock physics codes consider the resist-ance of matter against plastic deformation and, thus, account for plastic work and its contribution to the energy budget and temperature (e.g., Collins, 2014; Collins et al., 2004). Its effect on impact-induced melting and heat-ing has been studied recently (Kurosawa & Genda, 2018; Kurosawa et al., 2021; Quintana et al., 2015; Wakita et al., 2019, 2022). According to these studies the contribution of plastic work to impact-induced melting and heat-ing is significant up to a certain impact velocity at about 10 km/s. At higher velocities shock-heating dominates and the effect of plastic work becomes more and more negligible the stronger the shock wave. Commonly used scaling laws to estimate melt production in impact events (e.g., Abramov et  al.,  2012; Bjorkman & Holsapple,  1987; Pierazzo & Melosh, 2000; Pierazzo et al., 1997) are based on numerical modeling where basically the amount of matter that experiences shock pressures in excess of the critical shock pressure for melting is determined. Conse-quently, the widely used so-called Peak shock Pressure Method (PPM, after Quintana et al., 2015) does not account for the effect of plastic work (Pierazzo et al., 1997) and neither do scaling laws. Thus, the conventional scaling laws tend to underestimate melt production in particular at low impact velocities, depending on the strength of the involved matter. A more direct and straight-forward approach to determine melting in numerical modeling is, to use the temperature that is calculated by an equation of state (EoS) from density and internal energy, including the contribution from plastic work, in a computational cell and compare it with the solidus temperature for a given pressure. In principle this can be done at any point in time in the course of crater formation; however, it is usually conducted at the end of a simulation when more-or-less a steady state is achieved and the main dynamic motions have ceased to account for decompression melting and late-stage pressure fluctuations. We refer to this approach to quantify melt production as Final Temperatures Method (FTM, after Quintana et  al.,  2015). However, this method suffers from artificial diffusion mainly caused by averaging out temperatures due to mixing within cells of the computational grid and advection across cell boundaries which may significantly affect melt quantification (Artemieva, 2007). We further elaborate on problems inherent to the two methods in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.To quantify melt production more accurately, we introduce an update of the PPM to account for plastic work besides shock heating and decompression melting (Manske et al., 2021). We describe the approach of our new method and compare it with results from previous studies using the FTM. With our new approach, we can quan-tify the contribution of heating due to plastic work on melting in more detail and compare it with the contribution from the shock wave. We do not take porosity into account in our study, but the proposed approach is also appli-cable to porous materials. Finally, we further investigate the effect of the impact velocity and material strength on melt production.2. MethodWe implemented our new approach to determine the contribution from plastic work in the iSALE-2D shock physics code (e.g., Amsden et al., 1980; Collins et al., 2004; Melosh et al., 1992; Wünnemann et al., 2006) in combination with the analytical equation of state (ANEOS) (Melosh, 2007; Thompson & Lauson, 1972). Minor changes in a few subroutines of the iSALE source code (see Data Availability Statement) could be implemented basically in any shock physics code that allows for recording the necessary thermodynamic properties by tracers. In all impact scenarios we present in the following, we assume a dunitic composition pertaining to both target and projectile and calculate the thermodynamic state of matter by the ANEOS for dunite (Benz et al., 1989). The elastic-plastic material response against deformation is considered by a strength model, more specifically by the so-called “ROCK” model (Collins et al., 2004). In this model, the yield strength is defined as:𝑌𝑌 = (1 −𝐷𝐷)𝑌𝑌i +𝐷𝐷𝑌𝑌d, where Yi and Yd are the yield strength for intact and damaged material, respectively, and D expresses the damage the material experienced resulting in a reduction of strength. D = 1 correspondes to the maximum degree of damage and D = 0 the fully intact state. Following Kurosawa and Genda (2018) we neglect Yi since the damage  21699100, 2022, 12, Downloaded from https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022JE007426 by Freie Universitaet Berlin, Wiley Online Library on [19/02/2023].

The yield strength for damaged material is defined according to the Drucker-Prager dry-friction law:𝑌𝑌d = min (𝑌𝑌0 + 𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜇 𝜇 𝑌𝑌lim) Here, Y0 describes the materials cohesion, µ the friction coefficient, P is the pressure, and Ylim the von Mises plastic limit which coresponds to the the yield strenght at infinite pressure. Furthermore, the material's strength depends on its temperature, as the shear strength drops to zero when approaching the solidus temperature (Ohnaka, 1995).We use Lagrangian tracers to track the thermodynamic state the material experiences due to shock and plastic deformation. Massless Lagrangian tracers are placed initially in each computational cell of the Eulerian grid to represent the material within it. With the start of the simulation, the tracers move according to the velocity field in each computational timestep. As time progresses the tracers record the changes of physical properties within the cells that they pass such as pressure P and specific entropy S. The detailed procedure to estimate the total melt production is presented in detail in the next section.3. Melt QuantificationIn numerical models of impact cratering the thermodynamic state of material is described by state parameters such as temperature T, pressure P, specific entropy S, density 𝐴𝐴 𝐴𝐴 , and specific internal energy E that are linked to one another through an EoS. Depending on the EoS the melt temperature as a function of pressure is also provided; however, in this study we define solidus and liquidus temperature as a function of pressure independent from the EoS. Often shock physics codes do not record and track whether material is in solid, liquid or vapor state. At the end of a simulation—the end does not necessarily mean the end of crater formation—the thermodynamic state in each computational cell or tracer is evaluated to determine whether material is molten. In this section we summarize two commonly used approaches that come with advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, we modified one of the methods in order to eliminate some shortcomings.3.1. Final Temperature MethodA simple and straightforward approach to quantify impact-induced melting is to compare the final temperature in a cell or a tracer at the end of the simulation with the melt temperature taking into account the given ambient pres-sure. The so-called Final Temperature Method (FTM; Quintana et al., 2015) also accounts for heating by plastic work in addition to pure shock heating. Instead of temperature we use the specific entropy S that corresponds to the given temperature, specific internal energy E, and pressure P to ease the comparison with our improved approach (see Section 3.3). In addition, we record the entropy in a given cell by tracers which enables us to track the provenance of the molten material. Calculated results by the FTM via tracers and cells do not produce signif-icant differences.The problem of the FTM method is that it is grid-based. It relies on the thermodynamic state of a given cell. Since material is advected from one cell to another the thermodynamic state parameters suffer from artificial numerical diffusion. Numerical diffusion is a consequence of the transport of mass and energy through the grid of cells that is fixed in space, which results inevitably in an artificial dilution of strong gradients. Higher-order numerical solution schemes diminish numerical diffusion, but the longer the simulation and the more numerical iterations take place and the more mass and energy is advected, the stronger gradients and localized peaks in temperature and other state parameters are diluted and smeared out. The effect of numerical diffusion on melt production may be less problematic at early stages of crater formation, approximately up to the formation of the transient crater, but become more severe and lead to significant inaccuracies until the final or steady state of the crater is reached.3.2. Peak Shock Pressure MethodTo avoid numerical diffusion, a common approach uses the peak shock pressure recorded via tracers to deter-mine melting in numerical modeling of impact cratering (e.g., Artemieva & Lunine, 2005; Pierazzo et al., 1997; Wünnemann et al., 2008). The so-called PPM takes advantage of the fact that shock melting occurs if the maxi-mum shock pressure the material experiences is in excess of a certain critical pressure, which depends on the material and its condition (e.g., Liu et al., 2022; Manske et al., 2021). This critical shock pressure corresponds  21699100, 2022, 12, Downloaded from https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022JE007426 by Freie Universitaet Berlin, Wiley Online Library on [19/02/2023].

The PPM implicitly assumes that the entropy once risen by shock compression does not change during decompression, namely, adiabatic expansion. To calculate the melt production, the method uses a material-based Lagrangian approach by intro-ducing tracers that represent the material of the cell they were initially placed in and record the peak shock pressure and other physical properties the mate-rial experiences throughout the simulation.3.3. A Modified Peak Shock Pressure MethodWe extend the PPM to account for heating due to plastic work. To achieve this goal, we additionally implement the ability of tracers within the iSALE simulations to record the material's specific internal energy increase by plas-tic work Eplw. In other words, a certain tracer accumulates the plastic work of all computational cells it passes in the course of crater formation. Here, we describe the key modifications required to account for the contribution of plastic work to the total heat generated by impact in shock physics codes. The specific internal energy dissipated due to plastic work Eplw at a given time can be described as:plw= 1 ̇ for  () >  Here, 𝐴𝐴 𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the deviatoric stress tensor, 𝐴𝐴 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 describes the strain rate, and 𝐴𝐴 𝐴𝐴 is the materials density. 𝐴𝐴 𝐴𝐴𝑣𝑣 corresponds to the equivalent von-Mises stress which is calculated via the second invariant of the stress tensor and describes the transition from elastic to permanent plastic shear deformation if it exceeds the yield strength Y. In the numerical simulation, we accumulate the specific internal energy by plastic work Eplw for a given tracer i and timestep n as follows:𝐸𝐸𝑛𝑛+1𝑖𝑖𝑖plw= 𝐸𝐸𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖𝑖plw+𝑠𝑠𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝜌𝜌𝑛𝑛̇𝜀𝜀𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖∆𝑡𝑡 By additionally recording the tracers final pressure Pt and the peak shock pressure Pmax, we reconstruct the mate-rial's thermodynamic path using the EoS (ANEOS). Note, this is a post processing procedure after the simulation is finished and Pmax, Pt, and Eplw are known for each tracer. Figure 1 shows an example of an arbitrary tracer in P–S space.First, we calculate the Hugoniot curve corresponding to the materials initial thermodynamic condition (P0, S0). Then we work out the shock-induced pressure increase via the recorded peak shock pressure Pmax and the initial pressure for a given tracer. This is done by reconstructing the Rayleigh line starting at the initial position in the P–S space to the point where Pmax intersects the Hugoniot curve at (Pmax, S0 + Sshock). This maximum shock state reveals the entropy increase due to the shock Sshock. In a second step we calculate the release path from this state to the final state (Pt, S0 + Sshock + Splw). Upon release we approximate the change in the thermodynamic state in two steps: first we use ANEOS to calculate the isentropic release path to the final pressure Pt (Pt, S0 + Sshock). Up to this point we do not consider any contribution from plastic work according to the method used in Manske et al. (2021). A pure isentropic release only holds true if the effect of plastic work is negligible. Therefore, we add the accumulated energy the tracer has experienced by plastic work Eplw in a second step and work out the final state along an isobaric path to account for the contribution of plastic deformation. When the energy is added, the material ends up at the final state where the entropy increase due to plastic work Splw, which is determined by ANEOS (Pt, S0 + Sshock + Splw). Instead of using ANEOS, the thermodynamic path can be reconstructed by any other EoS. The energy contribution from the shock Eshock corresponds to the specific internal energy increase from the initial energy E0 to the energy at the state where the material has decompressed isentropically to the initial pressure after experiencing the shock (P0, S0 + Sshock). In the following we refer to PPM and PPM+ to indi-cate whether we neglect plastic work or take the contribution from plastic work into account.Figure 1.

Melt Quantification and AnalysisTo determine impact-induced melting we compare the post-impact entropy to the critical melt entropy, which corresponds to the melt temperature. The melt fraction of the material represented by the corresponding tracer i is defined as follows:𝜓𝜓𝑖𝑖⎧⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎩0, (∀𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖 < 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 )(𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖 − 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝐿𝐿 − 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆), (∀𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 < 𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖 < 𝑆𝑆𝐿𝐿)1, (∀𝑆𝑆𝐿𝐿 < 𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖) Here S, SS, and SL are the specific entropy, the entropy for incipient melting (solidus), and the entropy for complete melting (liquidus), respectively. In the frame of this work, we do not distinguish between melting and vaporiza-tion. If the entropy is in excess of SL the material is treated as superheated melt. The post-impact entropy S can be determined through the FTM, PPM, and PPM+.The total impact-induced melt production is evaluated by the melting efficiency πm, which is defined as the total melt volume normalized by the impactor volume Vp:𝜋𝜋𝑚𝑚 =Σ𝑖𝑖𝜓𝜓𝑖𝑖 ⋅ 𝑉𝑉?̇?𝑖𝑉𝑉𝑝𝑝 Here, Vi is the volume each tracer i represents, which corresponds to the volume of the computational cell the tracer was initially located in. 𝐴𝐴 𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖 describes the degree of melting of the material represented by the tracer and varies between 0 (no melt) and 1 (complete melting).The introduced method (PPM+) allows for quantifying the contribution of the different heating and melting processes. We do this by comparing the energy contribution from plastic work with the contribution from shock compaction. The ratio between plastic work and shock-induced internal energy for each tracer is given by:𝛾𝛾shock∕plw =𝐸𝐸shock∕plw𝐸𝐸shock + 𝐸𝐸plw The method also enables to distinguish between the relative volumetric proportion of melting caused by plastic work 𝐴𝐴 𝐴𝐴%plw or shock compression 𝐴𝐴 𝐴𝐴%shock :𝑚𝑚%shock∕plw=Σ𝑖𝑖𝜓𝜓𝑖𝑖𝑉𝑉?̇?𝑖𝛾𝛾shock∕plw𝑖𝑖Σ𝑖𝑖𝜓𝜓𝑖𝑖𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖 to quantify how much melt is produced due to the different heat mechanisms where 𝐴𝐴 𝐴𝐴%plw∕shock is 1 if the mecha-nism dominates and 0 if it does not contribute to melting (𝐴𝐴 𝐴𝐴%shock+ 𝐴𝐴%plw= 1 ).4. Impact Model SetupTo investigate the contribution from plastic work in impact-induced heating we carried out a systematic numer-ical modeling study. In our 2D vertical impact simulations we varied the impactor diameter L from 100 m to 50 km at a resolution, measured in cells per projectile radius, of 40. Furthermore, we varied the impact velocity vi from 2.5 up to 35 km/s. According to the material model described above we define strength by a friction coefficient of µ = 0.6 and cohesion of Y0 = 10 kPa. To simulate different rock strengths, we vary the von Mises plastic limit Ylim from Ylim = 0.5–3.5 GPa. We further assume an Earth-like gravity of g = 9.81 km/s 2. To quantify the effect of plastic work on melting, we setup a simplified impact scenario, where we ignore pressure depend-encies in the thermal profile and melt temperatures. Otherwise, the latter may lead to additional decompression melting, usually playing a role upon larger impact events (e.g., Manske et  al.,  2021). We assume a constant initial target and impactor temperature of T0 = 293 K. The melt temperatures including the solidus and liquidus are set to TS = 1358.85 (∼2360) and TL = 2053.15 K (∼2845 J/K/kg), respectively, after Katz et al. (2003) at atmospheric 1 bar. This results in a melt energy EM of 7.54 × 10 6 J/K, describing the specific energy of the shock  21699100, 2022, 12, Downloaded from https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022JE007426 by Freie Universitaet Berlin, Wiley Online Library on [19/02/2023].

Impact-Induced Melting as a Function of Velocity and StrengthThe new PPM+ method enables us to distinguish between the different heating mechanisms, shock and plastic work. In this section we investigate the effect of velocity and strength on impact-induced melt production regard-ing both heating mechanisms. We expect that the impact velocity strongly affects the relative contribution of plastic work on impact melting, since the peak shock pressure of the shock wave is primarily controlled by the impact velocity. Therefore, low velocity impacts generate no or only a negligible amount of shock melting, while plastic work may still be sufficient to induce melting. In addition, how much heat is generated by plastic work depends on the strength of the material.Figure 2 illustrates the melt fraction and the dominant mechanism of the melt production, which are mapped back to the pre-impact position as a function of strength and impact velocity. The lower the strength Ylim of the material and the higher the impact velocity vimp the less material is molten due to plastic work. For low impact velocities Figure 2. Melt contribution from plastic work in comparison to shock melting for varying impact velocities and strength (maximum strength Ylim). The left panel of each frame shows the degree of melt (red incipient melting and yellow complete/superheated melt). The right panel shows, which heating mechanism is dominating (yellow corresponds to pure shock heating and blue corresponds to pure plastic work heating). Material is mapped back to its initial pre-impact position to ease comparison between different scenarios. 21699100, 2022, 12, Downloaded from https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022JE007426 by Freie Universitaet Berlin, Wiley Online Library on [19/02/2023].

With increasing impact velocity, the melt volume and the proportion of shock melting increases (∼vimp > 10 km/s). Here, shock melting dominates a circular area of the melt region emerging from the impact point, which corresponds to the material experiencing the highest shock. With increasing impact velocity, this area increases and eventually covers the whole melt area (e.g., Figures 2b0–3). The material in this area, which concentrically spreads out from the so-called “isobaric core,” is predominantly completely molten and may be super-heated (c.f., Pierazzo et al., 1997). With increasing strength limit, melting due to plastic work dominates the outer part of the melt region, where pressures are too small to produce shock melt (e.g., Figures 2a–2d2). At first glance, the contribution to melting by plastic work may be negligible in some cases (e.g., Figure 2a3), but due to the cylindrical geometry, this area is large in volume. However, the produced melt at the rim of the melt region is mainly partially molten. At very low strength limits (Figure 2d, Ylim = 0.5 GPa) the contribution from plastic work can be neglected. At low velocities, heating due to plastic work dominates the melt production. To narrow down the velocity where plastic work or shock dominates melting in more detail, we plot in Figure 3 melting efficiency and the contribution of both heating mechanisms as a function of impact velocity vimp and the limiting strength Ylim.In general, our data agree with previous studies indicating that plastic work is the dominant heating process up to an impact velocity of approximately 10 km/s (Kurosawa & Genda, 2018). For higher impact velocities shock heating dominates melting. In more detail we find that the contribution from shock on melting efficiency for dunite under earth-like surface conditions (T0 = 298K and p0 = 1 atm) is negligible for impact velocities up to 7.5 km/s (c.f. Figure 3, left plot). Up to this threshold velocity, impact-induced melt is produced only at strength limits larger than 0.5 GPa and is dominated by heating due to plastic work. With increasing velocities, material strength affects the total melt production m %plw, depending on the materials yield strength (Figures 3a and 3c). While for a low yield strength limit of Ylim = 0.5 GPa no significant melt due to plastic work is produced. A large strength limit of Ylim = 3.5 GPa results in a contribution of plastic work on the total melt production of about 35% at a velocities of 12.5 km/s. At velocities higher than about 20 km/s, the contribution from plastic work becomes constant for increasing impact velocities, independent of the strength limit Ylim. Here, roughly 12% of the melt is still produced by plastic work at a strength of Ylim = 3.5 GPa. This contribution subsequently decreases with decreasing Ylim and can be neglected in case of the lowest strength of Ylim = 0.5 GPa.We further compare our data with the scaling law for dunite from Pierazzo et  al.  (1997), which is based on the PPM and thus only accounts for shock heating (Figure 3b). The scaling law approximately fits the data for Figure 3. (a, b) Melting efficiency πm and the contribution of plastic work on melting m %plw are plotted as a function of impact velocities and strength limits. Following Pierazzo et al. (1997), the melting efficiency is plotted against the melt number, vimp 2/EM, where the melt energy in the scaling-law is set to EM = 7.54 × 10 6 J/K (b). (a, c) The contribution from plastic work and shock melting is indicated with blue and yellow areas, respectively. 21699100, 2022, 12, Downloaded from https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022JE007426 by Freie Universitaet Berlin, Wiley Online Library on [19/02/2023].

The fact that the scaling law slightly underestimates our data for high velocities emerges from the consideration of partial melting, while the scaling law only accounts for the liquidus (EM), that is, complete melting. Here we adjusted the melt energy of the scaling law EM (from originally EM = 9 𝐴𝐴 ×  10 6 to EM = 7.54 𝐴𝐴 ×  10 6 J/kg) according to the liquidus function and the EoS used in this study (from originally SL = 3240 to SS = 2845 J/kg/K), however the effective melt energy in our simulations is reduced due to partial melting. In this velocity range, the increase in melt production with increasing strength Ylim follows a constant behavior and can be expressed by a reduction of the melt energy EM in the scaling law to account for plastic work (Pierazzo et al., 1997). For velocities lower than about 15 km/s however, melt production cannot be expressed by a power law anymore due to the breakdown of the point-source limit (e.g., Bjorkman & Holsapple, 1987; Pierazzo et al., 1997). Here the scaling law fails to give a reliable estimate and tends to overes-timate melt production when the velocity further decreases and strength limits are low (Ylim 𝐴𝐴 ≤  2.5 GPa). However, the scaling law fits the slope of the Ylim = 3.5 GPa data, which we consider to be coincidental.6. Discussion on Different Approaches to Quantify Impact MeltingThe quantification of shock-induced melting in numerical modeling requires only a simulation time until the shock wave has attenuated below the critical shock pressure for melting. Relative to the total crater formation time, this is a rather short time period. Therefore, it is computationally rather inexpensive to determine the amount of shock melting. However, to track the distribution and final deposition of melt it is necessary to simu-late the entire crater formation process. In addition, late-stage crater formation processes can cause additional melting due to plastic work, as shown above, and due to decompression (e.g., Ivanov & Melosh, 2003; Manske et al., 2021). In these cases, all Eulerian shock physics code, such as iSALE, suffer from artificial numerical diffusion the longer the simulation time and the more numerical iterations are calculated. Here we compare the different methodological approaches (FTM and PPM+, c.f. Method section) to determine melt production upon impact crater formation with respect to numerical diffusion.Figure 4 illustrates the effect of artificial diffusion on the entropy field for FTM. For better comparison we use a similar setup as Kurosawa and Genda (2018) for the hydrodynamic (Figure 4c) and strength case (Figure 4b), including an Earth-like gravity. Furthermore we added a run with a smaller impactor diameter L  =  500  m (Figure 4a) and tracked five selected tracers in each run according to the setup of Kurosawa and Genda (2018). We find that the FTM suffers severely from artificial diffusion if the impact-induced thermal anomaly experi-ences extensive displacement (advection) and stretching (c.f. Figure 4, left plots). This is the case when there is no strength present to resist the materials movement (Figure 4c) or if the impact-induced thermal anomaly is small relative to the transient crater (gray line). In the latter case, the thermal anomaly is stretched and advected beyond the transient crater's wall throughout crater formation (Figure 4a). Then, the potentially molten materials experi-ence further advection during the collapse of the transient crater. However, if the thermal anomaly is generated to a significant extent outside of the transient crater volume, it is less displaced (Figure 4b) and the FTM still deliver acceptable results at the steady state. Compared to the PPM+, the FTM is not able to conserve the peak entropies that are produced in the early contact and compression stage (c.f. Figure 4, center and right column). This can be observed in the histogram and S–t plot where the Entropy calculated by the PPM+ stays constant after heating while the Entropy in the FTM is altered by diffusion with ongoing advection and time. In the histogram (Figure 4, center column), this is indicated by the thin dotted lines describing earlier timesteps, where the FTM and the PPM+ show similar entropy values. Depending on the case (Figures 4a–4c), the accumulated entropy calculated by the FTM may significantly change with ongoing time until the steady state is reached (thick dashed lines). In the FTM the peak entropy values are diluted compared to the PPM+ leading to heating of surrounding, initially colder material. In the S–t plot (right), the entropy recorded by the five selected tracers is strongly affected by artificial diffusion when using the FTM.Figure 5 illustrates the melting efficiency πm as a function of impact velocity for different impactor sizes deter-mined by both methods, PPM+ and FTM. The yield strength Ylim is 3.5 GPa. Also, the melt efficiency calculated via the PPM is plotted which does not align with the shock contribution from the PPM+ because additional melt-ing partially due to the shock in the PPM+ emerges in combination with plastic work heating. In general, the melt production calculated by the PPM+ is not significantly affected by the impactor size. However, with increasing impactor size, gravity dominates the late-stage crater modification resulting in the formation of complex craters (e.g., L = 50 km). The more vigorous this late-stage modifications are, the more additional melt due to plastic  21699100, 2022, 12, Downloaded from https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022JE007426 by Freie Universitaet Berlin, Wiley Online Library on [19/02/2023].

Comparing the FTM with the PPM+ reveals significant deviations in melt production at the final state. In case of a large impactor L = 50 km, melting efficiency is underestimated for lower impactor veloc-ities at about 15 km/s and overestimated for impactor velocities of about 17.5 km/s. For the smaller impactors, melting efficiency is always underestimated. In the extreme case of L = 0.1 km, the majority of the melt is being ejected beyond the rim of the final crater. In this case, the temperature of the ejected material is significantly reduced due to diffusion during the advection and mixing with cold material in the computational cells outside the crater.Deviations between both methods can be explained by dilution of the impact-induced thermal anomaly resulting from artificial numerical diffusion in the FTM. Numerical diffusion can cause both an increase or decrease in the melt production. It depends on how much the thermal anomaly is smeared out and mixes with the surrounding material and how the resulting temperature compares with melting temperatures. To quantify these competing effects, we plot in Figure 6 the tracer's entropy cumulatively in a histogram for different time steps (dashed and dotted lines). The figure illustrates how the tracer's entropy Si calculated by the FTM and PPM+ change with time for different impact velocities, where impact-induced melt volumes are either over or underestimated. We choose an early simulation time during crater formation t1 where most of the impact-induced heating is completed and a late simulation time t2 when the steady state is reached, where the material barely moves anymore. In the PPM+ the tracer's post-heating entropy does not vary significantly with time. This, however, is not the case for the FTM, where artificial diffusion strongly effects the tracers' temperatures. At an early timestep t1 and a low Figure 6.

Along with the crater formation and increasing number of advection cycles at t2, numerical diffusion dilutes the thermal anomaly in the FTM until the steady state is reached (dashed and solid lines). This causes the maximum entropy of the anomaly to decrease but also to distribute the heat to the surrounding material (energy is conserved, but distributed over a larger area). At low velocities, the thermal anomaly is too small and decreases more rapidly below melting entropy, which results in underestimating the total melt production. At higher velocities, the opposite is the case. Here diluting of a sharp large thermal anomaly rather causes colder surrounding material to be heated above melting temperature than cooling hotter material below melting temperature. This results in overestimating melt production.7. Discussion and ConclusionWe have revisited the long-standing issue how to determine impact induced melt production in numerical simula-tions. We propose an update to the most widely used PPM to allow for taking into consideration the contribution from plastic work in addition to pure shock-heating. Based on a previous approach analyzing decompression melting (Manske et al., 2021) the presented method is capable to account for and quantify all relevant heating sources including shock, plastic work and with respect to melting also decompression melting as a consequence of structural uplift by a tracer-based method to avoid artificial diffusion of heat due to numerical advection errors.In previous work Quintana et al. (2015) compared the FTM with the PPM. They found that the FTM produces similar results to the PPM, however the PPM fails to quantify impact-induced melt at impact velocity below 8 km/s, where peak shock pressures are insufficient to generate shock melting, but some melting results from plas-tic work as shown by Kurosawa and Genda (2018). Our data agrees with these findings, and we demonstrate that the PPM+ solves this issue. Previous studies also indicate that the impact velocity vimp is the controlling param-eter for the relative contribution from plastic work on impact melt production. We can confirm that a significant change occurs at a threshold velocity of about 10 km/s (Kurosawa & Genda, 2018) for dunite by quantifying the contribution of the shock and the plastic work to the melt production. The threshold velocity may vary depending on yield strength from 7.5 to 12.5 km/s for Ylim = 0.5 to Ylim = 3.5 GPa, respectively. At impact velocities below 17.5 km/s the contribution of plastic work almost linearly increases up to 100% at a velocity of 2.5 km/s. For impact velocities higher than 17.5 km/s and a high strength limit Ylim = 3.5 GPa, the contribution from plastic work is rather low and makes up about 12% of the melt. This contribution may be negligible, especially for lower strength limits. In a more realistic scenario, where the temperature (and pressure) dependent strength decreases with depth, the contribution of plastic work will further decrease with increasing impactor velocity and diame-ter. This is, because such impacts transfer more of their kinetic energy deeper into the target, where strength is reduced by thermal softening (Ohnaka, 1995). Thermal softening reduces the strength as temperature approaches the melt temperature. Melt is treated strengthless and usually melt viscosity is neglected. At a low yield strength limit of Ylim = 0.5 GPa, the contribution from plastic work is negligible. In this case and at high impact velocities vimp 𝐴𝐴 ≥  17.5 km/s, melting efficiency approximately agrees with scaling laws (Pierazzo et al., 1997). For lower impact velocities, the scaling law fails to accurately fit the data and tend to overestimate the melt as if strength was applied, though the scaling law only applies for pure shock melting such as the original PPM approach (Pierazzo et al., 1997). This is due to fact that at such low melt numbers vimp 2/EM 𝐴𝐴 ≤  30 (m %plw ≥ 0.5), the minimum impact velocity where melt and vapor is generated is almost reached and the point source assumption break down (e.g., Bjorkman & Holsapple, 1987; Pierazzo et al., 1997). So, the scaling law fails at low velocities due to the extrap-olation of high velocity data in the shock melting regime vimp 2/EM > 30 (m %plw < 0.5). Here, the melt tends to be overestimated with decreasing velocity and the strength Ylim (Ylim 𝐴𝐴 ≤  2.5 GPa). For this reason, the usage of such scaling laws at low impact velocities has to be done with caution.A similar behavior with respect to the strength parameters and the impact velocity can be expected for other mate-rials, such as granite or basalt. The latter have slightly lower critical shock pressures than dunite (e.g., Stöffler et al., 2018). Thus, shock melting is more dominant and the threshold velocity, for the transition from plastic work-dominated to shock-dominated melting is expected to be smaller.We demonstrate that the improved method (PPM+) is more robust against numerical diffusion than the intrinsic Final Temperature Method (FTM) if simulations are carried until late stages of crater formation and the final deposition of melt is of interest. In the early stage of the simulations the FTM mostly provides sufficiently accu-rate results of the total melt production, neglecting late-stage heating. However, the FTM suffers from artificial  21699100, 2022, 12, Downloaded from https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022JE007426 by Freie Universitaet Berlin, Wiley Online Library on [19/02/2023].

Figure 4). Thus, the FFM should not be used in scenarios where strong diffusion (and thus temperature alteration) due to numerical advection errors is expected. This is often the case for simulations of late stages of crater formation, where it is necessary to consider plastic work and decompression melting during crater modification. The larger the transient crater is compared to the area of the thermal anomaly; the more advection is expected and the more the FTM may suffer from numerical inaccuracies (c. f. Figure 4). Also, the relationship of the amplitude of the thermal anomaly to the melt temperatures is important to monitor. When the thermal anom-aly is small compared to melting temperatures (usually at low impact velocities; here vimp < 15 km/s) artificial diffusion may lead to melt underestimation while for larger thermal anomalies (usually for high impact velocities; here vimp > 20 km/s) the opposite is the case.Data Availability StatementThe iSALE shock physics code is not entirely open-source but can be distributed on a case-by-case basis to academic users in the impact community for non-commercial use.

Damian",2013,"AbstractThe supercontinent cycle has had a profound effect on the Earth's evolution since the Late Archean but our understanding of the forces responsible for its operation remains elusive. Supercontinents appear to form by two end-member processes: extroversion, in which the oceanic lithosphere surrounding the supercontinent (exterior ocean) is preferentially subducted (e.g. Pannotia), and introversion in which the oceanic lithosphere formed between dispersing fragments of the previous supercontinent (interior ocean) is preferentially subducted (e.g. Pangea). Extroversion can be explained by “top–down” geodynamics, in which a supercontinent breaks up over a geoid high and amalgamates above a geoid low. Introversion, on the other hand, requires that the combined forces of slab-pull and ridge push (which operate in concert after supercontinent break-up) must be overcome in order to enable the previously dispersing continents to turn inward. Introversion may begin when subduction zones are initiated along boundaries between the interior and exterior oceans and become trapped within the interior ocean. We speculate that the reversal in continental motion required for introversion may be induced by slab avalanche events that trigger the rise of superplumes from the core-mantle boundary",,"Journal, Research paper",,,Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

These problems occur not only in ecology but also in economy of human society. Therefore it is important to understand the mechanism of the success in invasion and to predict possible invasions.   This study presents a methodology to forecast the outputs of an invasion. Native community responds to the invasion of the exotic species. Migration and competition are examples of the responses. We compute which response is the best strategy to maintain the native community. In addition, we simulate the superior invasion and large number of invasion species circumstances. In the light of native species extinction, avoidant response and flexible response are the most stable responses. On the other hand, strong response is the worst strategy.  We also measure the coupling of the native community for each response. From this result, although the results of the extinction are similar, flexible and avoidant response are not the same strategies",,"Thesis, Thesis",,,포항공과대학교

As used here, susceptibility is an estimate of the potential for physical change of an island coast in response to likely changes in climate–ocean boundary conditions. The evaluation is based on an assumption that the intensity of impact due to climate and ocean processes can be typically related to four physical and quantifiable variables: island rock-type (lithology), island shape (circularity), maximum elevation and area. These four physical variables were used to determine a dimensionless index for each of 1779 islands across 26 countries and 8 island types in the Pacific Ocean. Most islands fell in the high (29%), moderate (23%) and low (23%) susceptibility classes, whilst the remainder were split between the extremes of very high (12%) and very low (13%). Eleven countries had islands with all five levels, while eight had islands with mostly high and very high ratings.

People in poor nations are more vulnerable to the effects of endemic illnesses. Environmental biodiversity and area geography and biological mosquitoes and reservoirs factors, as well as response behavior and attitudes, all play a role in breaking the transmission cycle. Introduction There are many infectious illnesses in this area that have not been successfully eliminated by the state or society for a lengthy period of time. If the local government does not intervene, infectious illnesses can take a long time to spread from village to village, especially if there is a lack of awareness and education in the affected region.  A piece of land that is smaller than a continent but larger than a reef and completely encircled by water is referred to be an island (Dawson, 2016). The island is a shared property with numerous resources. The island has a number of health issues that might lead to an endemic sickness.  Disease that is endemic to a certain location or population is known as a pandemic. People in poor nations are more vulnerable to the effects of endemic illnesses. Other factors include uneven growth, as well as difficult-to-reach preventative and treatment strategies.  International health organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) are working to improve access to healthcare for people with endemic illnesses across the world, including in Indonesia.  To deal with and manage endemic illnesses, the government has implemented a number of measures through the Ministry of Health. The government, for example, has subsidized the 3M Plus Mosquito Nest Eradication (PSN) and the Jumantik 1 House 1 Movement in order to prevent dengue virus from spreading. Malaria prophylaxis, including the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets, repellents, and prophylactic medication, is part of the government's ongoing socialization and counseling efforts aimed at preventing malaria transmission (Monroe, 2020). After that, the government implemented the Filariasis Elimination Program, a plan to distribute mass-prevention medications for filariasis in several hotspots.  Health facilities and integrated service posts in Indonesia are now being targeted for outreach activities to promote and prevent the spread of endemic illnesses, rather than simply providing access to drugs. An educational and awareness-building effort is the primary goal of this program. To keep endemic illnesses from spreading and becoming widespread, the entire community must join together to lend a hand. We hope to learn more about the environmental features and disease endemicity of the major islands in order to better understand the causes of disease endemicity.  JOURNAL LA LIFESCI  VOL. 02, ISSUE 06 (013-017), 2022 DOI: 10.37899/journallalifesci.v2i6.540      14 ISSN 2721-1304 (Print), ISSN 2721-1207 (online) Copyright © 2022, Journal La Lifesci, Under the license CC BY-SA 4.0 Literature Review Causative factor Malaria Anopheles spp insects spread due to the presence of puddles of water, which mosquitoes use to lay eggs, hatch into larvae, and develop into pupae before becoming adult mosquitoes. Each Anopheles spp. breeds in a distinct environment depending on where it lives (Sukowati, 2008) While buffalo puddles have the greatest salinity (2 ppm), standing water (13 locations) is the most prevalent breeding habitat type, the water in as many as 15 locations is murky, and only 5 locations are shaded. The majority of these locations are also exposed to direct sunshine.  Many varieties of flora and animals were found in the water including mosses and rice plants, as well as tin head fish, water hyacinth and grass and moss in the rivers, rice fields, lakes and buffalo puddles. The salt level of the breeding habitat discovered on Sumba Island ranges from 0-2 this implies that the breeding habitat is mainly fresh water and brackish water. spp. normally live with a salinity of 0% in fresh water and 0-7% in brackish water.  At water salinity levels as low as 7.5ppm, An. sundaicus is the most common mosquito species on Sumba Island, and it may thrive in coastal locations with an altitude of between 0 and 40 dpl. According to hourly fluctuations in the number of anopheline species, the density begins to grow after midnight when most people begin taking naps.  More than 60.46 percent of Anopheles' resting activity occurred outside the home or around the cage (Table 2). For the most part, An. sundaicus was discovered resting in houses and walls, whereas An. annular was the least frequent species to be found there. However, An. kochi was not observed biting or resting in the home. According to this information, after sucking blood, mosquitoes would spend longer time outside before searching for a place to lay their eggs and reproduce. DHF (Dengue Fever) Rainwater plays a critical role in the supply of clean water in coastal areas. Keeping rainwater in barrels that aren't sealed might allow mosquitoes to breed there. According to the findings, the community's attitude was not positive. Many containers aren't closed, and individuals are draining water reservoirs, resulting in a large amount of water being squandered. In addition, because the Ae aegypti mosquito transmits dengue fever, living in close quarters makes it easier for the disease to spread. Because of their propensity to bite several people at once, mosquitoes have an easier time spreading dengue fever in highly populated residential areas.  Larval mosquitoes can transmit the dengue virus as they mature into adult mosquitoes that are capable of carrying the virus, which is why their presence has been linked to an increased risk of DHF. Dengue fever is not directly tied to the characteristics of the plank house or wall home, but the type of house that is damp, dark, and has a large number of holes without wire mesh will make it easier for mosquitoes to enter the house and spread disease. On the basis of female mosquitoes' tendency of searching for victims at night, the Indonesian Ministry of Health (2007) claims. The house is a hive of activity. Ae aegypti is known for persistently sucking blood (multiple bites).  Dengue fever is more likely to spread due to people's tendency to move about (Wong & AbuBakar, 2013). It is common for dengue fever to spread from one person to another by tracking the movement of people within a community. Dengue fever is more likely to spread in densely populated areas, such as coastal buffer zones, where the majority of individuals commute to and from their places of employment each day.     15 ISSN 2721-1304 (Print), ISSN 2721-1207 (online) Copyright © 2022, Journal La Lifesci, Under the license CC BY-SA 4.0 Filariasis The location of filariasis patients and the transmission chain are heavily influenced by the environment. Climate, geography, geological features, temperature, humidity, and so on are all examples of the physical environment. The development of filariasis transmission vectors is influenced by the physical environment, which is intertwined with vector life (Tabachnick, 2010). Mosquitoes can breed and relax in the physical surroundings. The spread of B. malayi, a sub-periodic nocturnal and periodic pathogen, is hampered by the existence of reservoir hosts (apes, langurs, and cats) and marshy vegetation. It is possible that the biological environment contributes to filariasis transmission. Aquatic plants, puddles, marshes, and shrubs are examples of the biological environment because they serve as breeding grounds for the Mansonia spp mosquito. Many plants, such as mangroves, mosses and algae, can have an impact on the larvae's survival by obstructing sunlight or protecting them from predators.  Mosquitoes typically have a flying range of between 0.5 and 1 kilometer. Humans who live in close proximity to puddles are at an increased risk of contracting filariasis because the mosquitoes that transmit filariasis are more easily accessible to them. Because they are shielded from sunshine and humidity, shrubs, cow pens, and hanging garments are ideal resting spots for mosquitoes before and after coming into contact with humans. Aside from their affinity for human and animal blood, certain mosquitoes are also known as zoophiles and anthropophiles. Filariasis transmission can occur in areas where there are shrubs, cattle pens, and garments hanging on hooks.  Among the many ways plants influence mosquito life is as a place to lay eggs, a place to hide from predators, a place for larvae to feed and a place for adults to rest until the gonotropic cycle begins. Another factor that helps predict the prevalence of mosquitoes is the availability of different types of plants in an area. Kodi Many aquatic plants, including as moss, algae, and other weeds, have taken up residence in the Balaghar Sub-District. There are a lot of mosquito larvae in this area because of the abundance of these plants. Health Aspect The archipelago has a wide range of health issues due to a variety of environmental causes. According to the journals we obtained, coastal and island environments are home to three distinct forms of illnesses. Each of these conditions is brought on by a parasite.  Mansonia, Culex, and Armigeres mosquitoes are the primary vectors of filarial worm infections that cause elephant foot disease (EFD). Inflammation of the ducts and lymph nodes, as well as recurring fever, are the most common acute clinical symptoms of the worms' presence in these organs (Gecse & Vermeire, 2018). Excessive growth in the arms, legs, breasts, and genital organs can be permanently disabling at an advanced level. Because this condition can lead to long-term disabilities that make the patient unable to work, they become a burden on their families and society, as well.  Plasmodium protozoa produce malaria, an acute infectious illness that is transmitted by mosquitoes (Paul et al., 2002). The female Anopheles mosquito bite is the vector for the transmission of this parasite. P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. Malaria are the four species that cause malaria in humans. Female Anopheles mosquitoes are responsible for the spontaneous transmission of malaria parasites. Infectious malaria can manifest as an acute or long-term infection. Plasmodium asexualis enters the human body and is spread by female Anopheles mosquitoes, which carry the illness. An erythrocyte-parasitic illness, malaria is marked by the detection of asexual forms of Plasmodium in the blood. Anemia, chills, and splenomegaly are all symptoms of malaria infection. It can be either acute or long-term.    16 ISSN 2721-1304 (Print), ISSN 2721-1207 (online) Copyright © 2022, Journal La Lifesci, Under the license CC BY-SA 4.0 Infection with malaria can be mild or develop systemic consequences, which is described as """"severe malaria."""" Malaria infection. A babesiosa infection, which results in babesiosis, is a parasite illness that resembles malaria (Sudoyo, et al 2006).  Indigenous occurrences are observed to be endemic in numerous Indonesian archipelagic locations. Tidore is home to one of them. If indigenous instances are still detected, the potential for becoming an area of elimination is thwarted. Indigenous is a localized illness. No indigenous transmission of malaria has been observed in the region designated as a malaria-free zone. (Health Department of Tidore, 2016) Activities to strengthen the Early Alert System/SKD can help keep the Akelamo Health Center's operating area free of indigenous illnesses. The Mass Blood Survey, a community-wide effort to collect blood samples for the purpose of identifying the malaria parasite, is one activity that might help enhance the Early Awareness System for puskesmas. The solution  The goal of filariasis control is to disrupt the transmission chain. Environmental biodiversity and area geography and biological mosquitoes and reservoirs factors, as well as response behavior and attitudes, all play a role in breaking the transmission cycle (Sylvie et al., 2008). Therefore, the entire community must take an active part to guarantee that there are no more vector breeding access points by preventing the creation of puddles.  DHF incidences in Tarakan were exacerbated by the absence of potable water in the neighborhood. As a result, coastal populations' access to safe drinking water is highly reliant on rainfall. Keeping rainwater in barrels that aren't sealed might allow mosquitoes to breed there. Because of this, the 3M program must be included into the overall community structure.  Malaria vectors and their breeding habitats have been discovered in several Indonesian islands and coastal areas, so efforts must be made to eliminate breeding sites by stockpiling or draining puddles of water, using insect repellent, and wearing long clothes when engaging in outdoor activities to prevent the transmission of malaria to others. Conclusion Mosquitoes can reproduce in unfavorable environmental conditions, such as the presence of disease agents conveyed by water media, which can lead to the emergence of endemic illnesses such as malaria and dengue fever.

This allowed us to directly test the assumption that island species have small values of Ne. We found that island species had significantly less genetic diversity than mainland species; however, this pattern could be attributed to a subset of island species that appeared to have undergone a recent population bottleneck. When these species were excluded from the analysis, island and mainland species had similar levels of genetic diversity, despite island species occupying considerably smaller areas than their mainland counterparts.

island susceptibility hypothesis,541016526,A few words about the sensitivity of island communities,,"Jedrusik, M.",2016,"For a long time, islands have served as the focal point for the studies of numerous researchers, who have been treating them as research laboratories. Their closed-off worlds created by the significant water barrier have caused their evolution to progress differently than on continental land. The isolation has produced endemism, relicts, and ecological niches, which made the islands very sensitive to the external hazards related to the introduction of foreign species. The world 's history is full of examples of such ecological catastrophes and scientific history contains numerous descriptions of them. If the entire animate nature - the flora and the fauna - was endangered, why would the islanders have it any different? Meanwhile, there is much less information concerning the fates of the isolated island communities, which experienced just as dramatic effects resulting from their contacts with foreign arrivals. This study aims to present such relatively recent episodes in the world's history. The article contains fragments and supplements of the thesis previously proposed in M. Jędrusik's book entitled """"Wyspy tropikalne. W poszukiwaniu dobrobytu (Tropical Islands. In Search of Prosperity)"""" (2005). The presented examples from various islands in Oceania confirm the dramatic effects of contacts between the natives and the migrants as well as the diverse resistance of various island populations, which depend on the historical population density of the given regions. It should be noted that limited demographic potential caused more difficulties to the rebuilding of the population than on the continents, thus considerably limiting the development of the territories experiencing this effect. However, the main cause of this hecatomb did not arise from the bad intentions of the arrivals, but the lack of biological immunity among the islanders. The predominantly white arrivals physically destroyed the erstwhile world of the natives, which was sometimes rather erroneously perceived as a distant paradise. The physical barrier between the islands and the continents - the ocean - may be still there, but these contacts made the """"immune"""" endemism of the islanders disappear.

The grammatical account posits that island effects result from syntactic constraints on wh-movement, whereas the resource-limitation view posits that low ratings emerge due to processing-related constraints on the parser, such that islands themselves present processing bottlenecks. The current study addresses this debate by investigating the relationship between island sensitivity and individual differences in cognitive abilities, as it has been argued that the two views make distinct predictions regarding whether a relationship should hold. Building directly on Sprouse et al. (2012a), we tested 102 native English speakers on 4 island types (whether, complex NP, subject, and adjunct islands) using an acceptability judgment task with wh-questions presented in context to quantify island sensitivity and three cognitive tasks to capture individual differences in working memory (via reading span and counting span task) and attentional control (via a number Stroop task). Our methodological approach takes into account several criticisms that have been made of Sprouse et al.’s (2012a; b) work, particularly the criticisms outlined in Hofmeister et al. (2012a; b).

It uses the trajectory of exposure and vulnerability (TEV) approach that it defines as ‘storylines of driving factors and processes that have influenced past and present territorial system exposure and vulnerability to impacts associated with climate variability and change.’ The study is based on the analysis of six peer-reviewed Pacific island case studies covering various geographical settings (high islands vs low-lying reef islands, urban vs rural) and hazards associated with climate variability and change; that addressed the interactions between natural and anthropogenic driving factors; and adopted multidecadal past-to-present approaches. The findings emphasize that most urban and rural reef and high islands have undergone increasing exposure and vulnerability as a result of major changes in settlement and demographic patterns, lifestyles and economies, natural resources availability, and environmental conditions. The article highlights three generic and successive periods of change in the studied islands’ TEV: from geopolitical and political over the colonization-to-political independence period; to demographic, socio-economic, and cultural from the 1960s to the 1980s; culminating in the dominance of demographic, socio-economic, cultural, and environmental drivers since the 1980s.

Reduced immune functions have been previously proposed to be part of this syndrome, as a consequence of the reduced diversity of pathogens on island ecosystems. According to this hypothesis, immune genes are expected to exhibit genomic signatures of relaxed selection pressure in island species. In this study, we used comparative genomic methods to study immune genes in island species (N = 20) and their mainland relatives (N = 14). We gathered public data as well as generated new data on innate (TLR: Toll-Like Receptors, BD: Beta Defensins) and acquired immune genes (MHC: Major Histocompatibility Complex classes I and II), but also on hundreds of genes with various immune functions. As a control, we used a set of 97 genes, not known to be involved in immune functions based on the literature, to account for the increased drift effects of the lower effective population sizes in island species. We used synonymous and non-synonymous variants to estimate the selection pressure acting on immune genes. We found that BDs and TLRs have higher ratios of non-synonymous over synonymous polymorphisms (Pn/Ps) than randomly selected control genes, suggesting that they evolve under a different selection regime. However, simulations show that this is unlikely to be explained by ongoing positive selection or balancing selection. For the MHC genes, which evolve under balancing selection, we used simulations to estimate the impact of population size variation. We found a significant effect of drift on immune genes of island species leading to a reduction in genetic diversity and efficacy of selection. However, the intensity of relaxed selection was not significantly different from control genes, except for MHC class II genes. These genes exhibit a significantly higher level of non-synonymous loss of polymorphism than expected assuming only drift and evolution under frequency dependent selection, possibly due to a reduction of extracellular parasite communities on islands. Overall, our results showed that demographic effects lead to a decrease in the immune functions of island species, but the relaxed selection that is expected to be caused by a reduced parasite pressure may only occur in some categories of immune genes",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/article, Journal articles",[SDV.BA]Life Sciences [q-bio]/Animal biology,,Peer Community In/Centre Mersenne

This relationship demonstrates a remarkable consistency across spatial and taxonomic scales (MacArthur &amp; Wilson, 1967) and has significant evolutionary consequences because island organisms are expected to respond to the empty niche space through a series of major transformations in their life-history traits (see Whittaker &amp; Fernan-dez-Palacios, 2007).

Likewise, there is high confidence that wave over-wash of seawater will degrade fresh groundwater resources {29.3.2} and that sea surface temperature rise will result in increased coral bleaching and reef degradation. {29.3.1.2} Given the dependence of island communities on coral reef ecosystems for a range of services including coastal protection, subsistence fisheries, and tourism, there is high confidence that coral reef ecosystem degradation will negatively impact island communities and livelihoods.Given the inherent physical characteristics of small islands, the AR5 reconfirms the high level of vulnerability of small islands to multiple stressors, both climate and non-climate (high confidence; robust evidence, high agreement). However, the distinction between observed and projected impacts of climate change is often not clear in the literature on small islands (high agreement). {29.3} There is evidence that this challenge can be partly overcome through improvements in baseline monitoring of island systems and downscaling of climate- model projections, which would heighten confidence in assessing recent and projected impacts. {WGI AR5 9.6; 29.3-4, 29.9}Small islands do not have uniform climate change risk profiles (high confidence). Rather, their high diversity in both physical and human attributes and their response to climate-related drivers means that climate change impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation will be variable from one island region to another and between countries in the same region. {Figure 29-1; Table 29-3} In the past, this diversity in potential response has not always been adequately integrated in adaptation planning.There is increasing recognition of the risks to small islands from climate-related processes originating well beyond the borders of an individual nation or island. Such transboundary processes already have a negative impact on small islands (high confidence; robust evidence, medium agreement). These include air-borne dust from the Sahara and Asia, distant-source ocean swells from mid to high latitudes, invasive plant and animal species, and the spread of aquatic pathogens. For island communities the risks associated with existing and future invasive species and human health challenges are projected to increase in a changing climate. {29.5.4}Adaptation to climate change generates larger benefit to small islands when delivered in conjunction with other development activities, such as disaster risk reduction and community-based approaches to development (medium confidence). {29.6.4} Addressing the critical social, economic, and environmental issues of the day, raising awareness, and communicating future risks to local communities {29.6.3} will likely increase human and environmental resilience to the longer term impacts of climate change. {29.6.1, 29.6.2.3; Figure 29-5}Adaptation and mitigation on small islands are not always trade-offs, but can be regarded as complementary components in the response to climate change (medium confidence). Examples of adaptation-mitigation interlinkages in small islands include energy supply and use, tourism infrastructure and activities, and functions and services associated with coastal wetlands. The alignment of these sectors for potential emission reductions, together with adaptation, offer co-benefits and opportunities in some small islands. {29.7.2, 29.8} Lessons learned from adaptation and mitigation experiences in one island may offer some guidance to other small island states, though there is low confidence in the success of wholesale transfer of adaptation and mitigation options when the local lenses through which they are viewed differ from one island state to the next, given the diverse cultural, socioeconomic, ecological, and political values. {29.6.2, 29.8}The ability of small islands to undertake adaptation and mitigation programs, and their effectiveness, can be substantially strengthened through appropriate assistance from the international community (medium confidence). However, caution is needed to ensure such assistance is not driving the climate change agenda in small islands, as there is a risk that critical challenges confronting island governments and communities may not be addressed. Opportunities for effective adaptation can be found by, for example, empowering communities and optimizing the benefits of local practices that have proven to be efficacious through time, and working synergistically to progress development agendas. {29.6.2.3, 29.6.3, 29.8",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/bookPart, Book sections","small islands, climate change, impacts, vulnerability, adaptation, [SDE]Environmental Sciences, [SHS]Humanities and Social Sciences",,'Cambridge University Press (CUP)'
island susceptibility hypothesis,519913059,On the vulnerability of Small Island Developing States: A dynamic analysis,,"Scandurra, G., Romano, A.A., Ronghi, M., Carfora, A.",2018,"Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are generally considered highly vulnerable to climate change because they suffer from most common environmental problems due to their smallness, remoteness and exposure to natural hazards, though they contribute less to climate change. However, international cooperation can improve the negative impacts of climate change by incentivizing adaptation policies. The vulnerability assessment becomes crucial because it can be used to allocate the international cooperation resources targeted to adaptation plans.  The aim of this paper is to assess of the vulnerability in Small Island Developing States.  Using a comprehensive dataset including 32 variables, we synthetize the vulnerability with a composite indicator. Then, we analyze the vulnerability’s dynamics over time from 2009 to 2014. Lastly, we explore the dimensions of vulnerability to assess those that have a greater weight on overall vulnerability. Our findings show that the vulnerability of Small Island Developing States is partly driven by common characteristics, such as isolation and extreme exposure to the effects of climate change, but the degree of vulnerability of identified dimensions is different among countries. Our results give indications to better target development aid, giving suggestions on the more relevant dimensions for action to reduce the vulnerability of each country",,text,"Vulnerability index, Small Island Developing States, Climate change, Adaptation policies, composite indicator, Terrestrial and Aquatic Ecology",,The Maritime Commons: Digital Repository of the World Maritime University

Despite recent focus on the geographical distribution of viruses and bacteria, the overall environmental distribution of human pathogens and parasites on Earth remains incompletely understood. As islands have long inspired basic ecological insights, we aimed to assess whether the microorganisms that cause human disease in modern times follow patterns common to insular plants and animals.Location Global and regional.Methods Relying on the publically accessible GIDEON database, we use the spatial distribution of nearly 300 human parasites and pathogens across 66 island countries and territories to assess the current predictive value of the 'equilibrium theory' of island biogeography. The relationships between species richness and (1) island surface area and (2) distance to the nearest mainland were investigated with linear regression, and ANCOVAs were used to test for differences in these relationships with respect to pathogen ecology and taxonomy.Results Pathogen species richness increases with island surface area and decreases with distance to the nearest mainland. The effect of area is more than 10 times lower than that usually reported for macroorganisms, but is greater than the effect of distance. The strongest relationships are for pathogens that are vector-borne, zoonotic (with humans as dead-end hosts) or protozoan.Main conclusion Our results support the basic predictions of the theory: disease diversity is a positive function of island area and a negative function of island isolation. However, differences in the effects of area, distance and pathogen ecology suggest that globalization, probably through human travel and the animal trade, has softened these relationships.

Violent winds, floods, and draughts have had severe consequences for millions of people and currently present an increasingly significant challenge for development and poverty alleviation in small islands. However, although islands tend to have similar geographical features, natural hazards produce widely different outcomes in different island states, indicating great variation in resilience. While some islands seem to cope and adapt fairly well, others suffer tremendously. That is the impact of natural hazards of the same physical magnitude ranges from going more or less unnoticed or causing only small disturbances to resulting in severe catastrophes. The overall objective of this paper is to explore the suggested sources of this variation further. More specifically, with the point of departure in theories about how institutions and social contracts affect collective action and adaptive capacities, this paper sets out to investigate how political institutions such as democracy, corruption, and government effectiveness impact the overall resilience of island states.

Despite of their importance in syntactic theory, the heterogeneity of island constraints has posed many difficult challenges to linguistic theory, across all frameworks. The HPSG perspective of island phenomena is that they are unlikely to be due to a unitary syntactic constraint given the fact that virtually all such island constraints have known exceptions. Rather, it is more plausible that island constraints result from a combination of independently motivated syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and processing phenomena. The present chapter is somewhat different from others in this volume in that its focus is not on HPSG analyses of some phenomena, but rather on the nature of the phenomena itself. This is because there is evidence that most of the phenomena are not purely grammatical, and to that extent independent from HPSG or indeed any theory of grammar.

Although there is some evidence of less complex interaction networks on oceanic islands, only a few studies have compared island communities with each other or with mainland communities. Here, we analyse the species composition and structural properties of quantitative flower visitation networks in two communities of each of two different island systems: the Canary Islands (oceanic origin) and the Balearic Islands (continental origin). We compared different network parameters to inform us about their vulnerability in the face of different types of disturbance. The number of species was greater in the Balearic than in the Canarian networks but, contrary to expectations, the total number and diversity of interactions did not differ between them. Moreover, a greater number of opportunistic species and the presence of super-generalist species on the oceanic island led to significantly higher values of quantitative connectance and nestedness relative to those on the continental island. Given that these two parameters are associated with network stability, our findings support the hypothesis that oceanic island communities are less vulnerable to perturbations than are those of continental islands, although further studies with a network approach are needed to determine whether this is a general pattern. © 2014 The Linnean Societ",,text,Balearic Islands – Canary Islands – mutualistic interactions – nestedness –,,

The mechanisms of island drowning remain enigmatic, however, and the subaerial lifespan of volcanic islands varies widely. We examine swell bathymetry and island drowning at 14 hotspots and find a correspondence between island lifespan and residence time atop swell bathymetry, implying that islands drown as tectonic plate motion transports them past mantle sources of swell uplift. This correspondence argues strongly for dynamic uplift of the lithosphere at ocean hotspots.

However, the relative contributions of these factors on a global scale are unclear. Methods: We randomly selected 94 islands stratified by socioeconomic and geographic characteristics. With a Bayesian model, we assessed factors contributing to the probability of islands having a history of any dengue outbreaks and of having frequent outbreaks. Results: Minimum temperature was strongly associated with suitability for DENV transmission. Islands with a minimum monthly temperature of greater than 14.88C (95 % CI 12.4–16.68C) were predicted to be suitable for DENV transmission. Increased population size and precipitation were associated with increased outbreak frequency, but did not capture all of the variability. Predictions for 48 testing islands verified these findings. Conclusions: This analysis clarified two key components of DENV ecology: minimum temperature was the most important determinant of suitability; and endemicity was more likely in areas with high precipitation and large, but not necessarily dense, populations.

While the media, policy, and often scientific arenas essentially focus their attention on Small Island Developing States (SIDS), which are widely recognised as hotspots of global climate change, the situation of the numerous other vulnerable island territories has been relatively neglected. As a result, the focus on SIDS has paved the way for mainstream adaptation research and, in turn, for biases in the interpretation of climate change vulnerability and risks of small islands in general. Here, we argue that such an overly narrow scope severely limits our understanding of island-specific issues that influence island societies’ adaptability to on-going and future climate change. This article reviews the current perspective on challenges and opportunities for climate change adaptation on SIDS and compares it with other types of island territories, especially dependent islands of continental states and semi-autonomous sub-national island jurisdictions (SNIJ). This comparison reveals that despite critical socio-political differences between the respective island types, more general lessons can be learned as island territories at large face similar issues both regarding the drivers of vulnerability and exposure and the adaptation measures needed.

Terrestrial and marine habitats are inextricably connected; incorporating the connections between the two to any research or management of these systems will improve efficacy by improving the resolution of our understanding of ecosystem drivers. If we are to incorporate land-sea connectivity into research and management, we first need to clarify our understanding of the patterns and variability of connectivity across geographic and biological contexts. The focus of this paper is to identify the factors mediating the ecological connection between land and sea on islands, which can be interpreted to determine the local importance of land-sea connectivity and identify candidate mechanisms defining the connectivity. With more detailed understanding of land-sea linkages, there is opportunity to apply this knowledge toward applied issues of island resource management and restoration.

island susceptibility hypothesis,427152911,Why do some small islands lack vegetation? Evidence from long-term introduction experiments,,"Morrison, Lloyd W.",2011,"Classic island biogeography theory predicts that very small islands, near the extreme lower end of the species-area relationship, should support very few species. At times no species may be present, however, due to randomness in the immigration-extinction dynamics. Alternatively, a lack of vegetation on very small islands may indicate that such islands do not contain the appropriate habitat for the establishment or long-term survival of plants, or that disturbances are too frequent or intense. These potential mechanisms were evaluated in the central Exumas, Bahamas, where surveys of 117 small islands revealed that over a third of the islands supported no terrestrial plant life. Area and exposure were significant predictors of whether a small island was vegetated or not in multiple logistic regressions. No islands naturally devoid of vegetation were colonized over a 17-yr period, and only two naturally vegetated islands lost all vegetation. Experimental introductions of two species -Sesuvium portulacastrum and Borrichia arborescens- revealed that a number of islands naturally lacking vegetation were able to sustain introduced populations over the long term (up to 15 yr). Drought and hurricanes appeared to have reduced the establishment success and possibly long-term survival of the introductions, although some populations survived four major hurricanes. Turnover rates of both introduced species were often an order of magnitude higher on the experimental introduction islands than on other islands in the archipelago. It appears many of the islands in this system that naturally lack vegetation may be physically capable of supporting terrestrial plant life, yet have no plants primarily due to barriers to colonization. © 2011 The Authors.

Future climate-change-induced increases in the intensity and frequency of major hurricanes2 and accelerations in sea level rise3,4 will have a significant impact on barrier islands5,6—leading to increased coastal hazards and flooding—yet our understanding of island response to external drivers remains limited1,7-8. Here, we find that island response is intrinsically bistable and controlled by previously unrecognized dynamics: the competing, and quantifiable, effects of storm erosion, sea level rise, and the aeolian and biological processes that enable and drive dune recovery. When the biophysical processes driving dune recovery dominate, islands tend to be high in elevation and vulnerability to storms is minimized. Alternatively, when the effects of storm erosion dominate, islands may become trapped in a perpetual state of low elevation and maximum vulnerability to storms, even under mild storm conditions. When sea level rise dominates, islands become unstable and face possible disintegration. This quantification of barrier island dynamics is supported by data from the Virginia Barrier Islands, U.S. and provides a broader context for considering island response to climate change and the likelihood of potentially abrupt transitions in island state.  Barrier islands respond to rising sea level by migrating landward or drowning7,9-10. Landward migration is driven mostly by storms and is controlled by island elevation. Extensive measurements of dune elevation performed at the Virginia Barrier Islands11, a relatively undisturbed barrier system including 12 islands, show a bimodal distribution of barrier island elevation with two well-defined island types: low-elevation and high-elevation islands (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 1). Low islands lacking vegetated dunes are relatively narrow and prone to frequent overwash, resulting in rapid landward migration (Fig. 1a,b,g) and low biodiversity (as in the case of the islands associated with the Mississippi Delta, e.g., The Chandeleur Islands). In contrast, high islands with well-developed dunes resist storm impacts, are wider and migrate slowly (if at all, Fig. 1c,d,g) and support a rich ecosystem and/or human development. In this way, barrier island evolution is fundamentally linked to dune dynamics.  However, because vegetated dunes both protect islands from storm impacts and are themselves 2  eroded by storms and affected by rising sea level, island dynamics ultimately arise from the competition between dune erosion and dune formation.   We investigate this competition by adding the effects of storms and sea level rise into a model of the physical and biological processes involved in coastal dune formation14, and then simulating long-term barrier island dynamics as multiple cycles of dune formation alternating with dune erosion during high water events (HWE; including all events—arising from local and distant storms—in which total water level R, i.e. mean sea level + tides + storm surge + wave runup, is above the mean high water level (MHWL)). The resulting model consists of a set of differential equations describing the morphodynamic feedback between aeolian sand transport and topography, the interaction between vegetation growth and sand transport, and the effects of the shoreline on sand transport, as well as the newly added effects of vegetation sensitivity to salt water inundation15,16, storm-induced sand transport above MHWL, and RSLR (Methods and Supplementary Methods). For simplicity all boundary and initial conditions are uniform in the alongshore direction (i.e. the island has alongshore symmetry) and thus, island elevation is equivalent to local dune elevation.  Simulations show that immediately following an overwash event, island elevation is too low to sustain the growth of ‘dune-building’ plants (Fig. 2a). In the absence of vegetation, small non-vegetated dunes slowly nucleate at the back of the beach in response to the interaction between morphology and wind flow (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 2) following the same mechanisms as the nucleation of desert dunes17. Once sand elevation is sufficiently high to allow vegetation recovery (a threshold defined by the minimum elevation Zc above the MHWL that ‘dune-building’ plants can effectively grow, see Methods) vegetated dune growth begins as plants trap sand, thereby accelerating vertical accretion and leading to rapid dune building. In the absence of storm erosion, dunes eventually reach a maximum size14 (Fig. 2a,b).   Consideration of the processes behind vegetation recovery, and thus dune recovery, shows that the vegetation recovery time Tv increases with relative sea level rise because the rate of net surface accretion—which prevents frequent salt-water inundation of the backshore and leads to vegetation recovery—is the difference between the growth rate G0 of the non-vegetated incipient dunes and the rate S of RSLR. The growth rate G0 scales as the ratio of the mean aeolian sand flux at the beach q0, an increasing function of wind intensity and (dry-) sand supply, and the non-vegetated dune wavelength λ17. The vegetation recovery time Tv then relates the primary 3  factors influencing vegetation and dune recovery: vegetation sensitivity to inundation (Zc), aeolian transport (q0), and RSLR (S): 𝑇𝑣 ≈ 𝑍𝑐 (𝛽𝑞0𝜆−1 − 𝑆)⁄ , with fitting parameter 𝛽 ≈ 0.1 (Supplementary Fig. 3).  After imposing periodic high water events (HWEs) with random total water level R, the stochastic dynamics of barrier island elevation is controlled by the ratio of the vegetation recovery time (Tv) and the period (THWE) of HWEs (Fig. 3a-c). This ratio characterizes the competition between external erosive and internal recovery processes and therefore we call it the ‘vulnerability’ index (𝛾=Tv/THWE). When the period of HWEs is larger than the vegetation recovery time (𝛾 < 1), vegetation recovers before the next HWE, thus enabling rapid dune growth (Fig. 3a). Since dune erosion is mainly controlled by the ratio between R and dune elevation H18 (Supplementary Fig. 4), rapid dune recovery leads to a negative feedback in which higher elevation, and therefore lower vulnerability to wave erosion, allows dunes to remain close to their maximum height. This high-elevation state thus represents a stable dynamical equilibrium for barrier island elevation. When the period of HWEs is shorter than the vegetation recovery time (𝛾 > 1), low areas devoid of vegetation cannot recover before the next HWE. They remain vulnerable to erosion and are thus kept in a low-elevation state. In contrast, well-developed dunes are less prone to overwash and even when partially eroded—as long as some elevation and vegetation remain—they can recover quickly, evolving toward the high-elevation state. Therefore, for 𝛾 > 1 there is a tendency for a barrier island to exist either as a stable high island or a stable low island and the island becomes bistable (Fig. 3b,c). The onset of the bistable behavior at 𝛾 = 1 has been verified numerically for varying winds, rates of RSLR and vegetation sensitivities (Fig. 3d,e).  The predicted bistability of island dynamics offers an explanation for the bimodal probability distribution function of island elevation observed for the Virginia Barrier Islands, along the mid-Atlantic coast of the U.S.. Assuming the temporal randomness of HWEs impacting a given location of the island is equivalent to the spatial randomness of HWEs acting at different locations alongshore, it is possible to compare qualitatively the simulated time series of local island elevation (e.g. Fig. 2b) to the measured alongshore elevation (Fig. 1e). In addition to predicting the observed bimodal distribution of dune elevation (Fig. 1f), the model also reproduces increases in shoreline change rate (used as a proxy for island migration rate) with decreasing average island elevation (Fig. 1g, h), which can be understood as an increasing contribution to average island migration rates from the rapidly migrating low sections of the island.  4  Within the bistable regime the stochastic nature of high water events (HWE), allows barrier islands to explore alternate equilibrium states with a certain probability. Transition from a high to a low state can be triggered either by low-frequency high-energy events such as large storms, or by frequent medium-energy events (Fig. 3a-c, Supplementary Fig. 5). Because the conditions to sustain a mature vegetated dune are very different than those needed to build it in the first place, there is a hysteresis in the response of island elevation to changing conditions, with dune recovery taking place at a lower vulnerability index than the one required for severe dune erosion (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Therefore, the fact that an island is in a high state is not enough to conclude that it can recover quickly once in the low state, as can be seen in Fig. 3b-c where dune recovery takes longer for increasing vulnerability indices. Indeed, simulations show that the probability of dune, and therefore island, recovery (i.e. of entering the attractive basin of the high state) decreases exponentially with the vulnerability index (Fig. 3e), which means that the island will remain low in elevation for exponentially longer times.   The vulnerability index, which can be rewritten using the scaling of the vegetation recovery time as  𝛾 = 𝑍𝑐 𝑇𝐻𝑊𝐸−1 (𝛽𝑞0𝜆−1 − 𝑆)⁄ ,    (1) summarizes the role of the key factors driving barrier island response (Fig. 4). The transition from a stable high island to a bistable one is accelerated by higher rates of RSLR, more vulnerable vegetation or more frequent HWE, but retarded by increasing aeolian transport. For negative net accretion rates (𝛾 < 0) the island enters a new unstable regime in which the low-elevation state becomes intertidal/subtidal (i.e., below the MHWL) and the island may disintegrate (Fig. 4). Therefore, the vulnerability index provides a deeper insight into long-term island dynamics, regardless of perturbations that may occur in the short term. For example, the progressive disintegration of barrier islands along the Mississippi delta (e.g. the Chandeleur Islands) that has been attributed to a series of recent major storms20, could alternatively be understood as a consequence of transition into the unstable regime (Fig. 4) triggered by an increase in RSLR compounded by a reduction in sand supply9. Similarly, the Virginia Barrier Islands appear to have experienced transition to the bistable regime, in which high and low islands co-exist, possibly driven by locally high RSLR4 and a reduction in aeolian sand transport arising from the combined effects of shell armoring21 and exposure of marsh platform (i.e. less sand supply) on the foreshore (Fig. 1i, j).    The bistable dynamics suggested by model results contributes to a growing literature reporting the existence of alternate stable states in ecosystems as diverse as arid lands, forests, lakes, oceans and coral reefs22 and more recently, shallow coastal bays23. Along with a few more recent studies24, 25, we demonstrate the importance of 5  biophysical feedbacks in leading to state changes that affect not only the ecosystem that inhabits the landscape, but the morphology of the landscape itself. As in all multi-state systems, barrier islands—which are often heavily developed, and which serve as important interfaces between the marine and terrestrial realms—may cross the threshold to bistability silently, without providing observable evidence until the state change becomes locked in place by a random event. Additionally, because barrier islands are coupled to adjacent coastal ecosystems such as shallow coastal bays and marshes26, which also exhibit multiple stable states23, a disturbance that triggers a transition in island state may initiate a cascade of transitions across the broader landscape. For landscapes and ecosystems generally, analytical expressions for boundaries between system regimes (e.g., here, from stable to bistable, or from bistable to unstable), have the potential to be even more useful than leading indicators27 that merely warn of an impending change.  For example, control parameters such as the vulnerability index have the potential to provide a means for assessing the likelihood that a landscape system will transition to a new regime under a given set of conditions, as well as quantitative guidance on management strategies intended to decrease system vulnerability and increase resilience.    Methods  The coastal dune model describes the temporal evolution of the sand surface elevation h(x, y, t)–defined relative to the mean high water level (MHWL)—and the cover fraction ρveg (x, y, t) for a single generic grass species. x is the cross-shore distance to the shoreline (x = 0), which separates the foreshore (x < 0) from the backshore (x > 0), and y is the alongshore coordinate. A complete description of the coastal dune model is provided in the Supplementary Methods and includes further details on the calculation of the aeolian transport and vegetation dynamics as well as the initial and boundary conditions used to integrate the model.   Aeolian sand transport: In the absence of storms, the sand flux ?⃗?𝑎(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡) is calculated from the bed wind shear stress, which depends on the surrounding topography and the vegetation cover, and the local sand transport threshold, which we assume is primarily controlled by the sand moisture content. For simplicity in the formulation, sand transport is described by volume, not mass, flux.  Storms: Storms are defined in the model as high water events (HWEs) with total water elevation R above the MHWL (R is defined relative to the MHWL). HWEs are considered periodic with period THWE and have 6  constant duration.. R is randomly distributed following an Erlang distribution 𝑅2?̅?−3𝑒−3𝑅 ?̅?⁄  (?̅? is mean total water elevation) which has an exponential tail, in agreement with Ref. 28, and filters tidal events (i.e. there are no events for 𝑅 → 0).   Storm–induced sand transport: We derive a phenomenological expression to calculate the cross-shore sand flux 𝑞𝑠𝑡(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡) for elevations between MHWL and R during high water events (HWE). Based on Ref. 29 (see Ref. 30 for the validation of a similar formulation), we assume the net sand flux 𝑞𝑠𝑡 over many swash cycles is proportional to the cube of the average speed 𝑈 of the uprushing wave front, times the time 𝛿𝑡 this particular location is submerged: 𝑞𝑠𝑡 ∝ 𝑈3𝛿𝑡/(𝑔𝑇), with gravity g and timescale T. The net sand flux is weighted by a downslope contribution (1 − 𝜕𝑥ℎ/ tan(𝛼)) that represents the tendency of the surface to reach the equilibrium foreshore slope tan (α). From energy conservation, the kinetic energy of the uprushing wave front is approximately balanced by its potential energy. In this case 𝑈 ∝ √𝑔(𝑅 − ℎ) and 𝛿𝑡 ∝ √𝑔(𝑅 − ℎ) (Ref. 29), which leads to 𝑞𝑠𝑡 = 𝑇−1(𝑅 − ℎ)2 (1 − 𝜕𝑥ℎ/ tan(𝛼)). We choose the rescaled duration of HWEs to qualitatively reproduce the main erosional regimes described in Ref. 18 (Supplementary Fig. 4). Crucially, the predicted bistable behavior of barrier islands only depends on the existence of these erosional regimes and not on the details of the sand flux formulation.  Surface dynamics: Foreshore (x < 0): We assume the foreshore to be always at equilibrium, defined by a constant slope of angle α. This assumption implies aeolian erosion is balanced by accretion in the swash zone. As a result, the simulated foreshore acts as a sand reservoir supplying an unlimited amount of sediment to the backshore, effectively feeding dune formation and post-storm recovery. Shoreline (x = 0): We assume, as a first approximation, that under RSLR the shoreline follows Bruun’s rule and migrates landward at a rate ?̇?𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑟𝑒 proportional to the rate S of RSLR. Backshore (x > 0): We calculate the change in the sand surface elevation h at the backshore from mass conservation as 𝜕ℎ 𝜕𝑡⁄ = − 𝜕𝑞𝑠𝑡 𝜕𝑥⁄  during HWEs, and 𝜕ℎ 𝜕𝑡⁄ = −∇ ∙ ?⃗?𝑎— 𝑆 + ?̇?𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑟𝑒 𝜕ℎ 𝜕𝑥⁄  otherwise. The last two terms at the right hand side describe the effects of RSLR and appear because we define the surface elevation relative to the sea level and the shoreline position.   7  Vegetation dynamics: As a first approximation, we assume a single generic grass species with a cover fraction ρveg that is sensitive to sand erosion and accretion and that can increase up to the maximum cover ρveg = 1 during a characteristic time tveg. We further assume plant growth is also sensitive to frequent salt-water inundation and thus to the proximity of the shoreline and to the elevation above MHWL, such that plants can effectively grow only landward of the vegetation limit Lveg and in places higher than a minimum elevation Zc. Thus, 𝑑𝜌𝑣𝑒𝑔 𝑑𝑡⁄ = (1 − 𝜌𝑣𝑒𝑔) 𝑡𝑣𝑒𝑔−1  Θ(𝑥 − 𝐿𝑣𝑒𝑔)Θ(ℎ − 𝑍𝑐) −  1𝑚−1|𝜕ℎ 𝜕𝑡⁄ |, where the Heaviside function Θ(s) (1 for s>0; 0 otherwise) defines the regions where plants can grow.  Parameters: We investigate model outcomes as function of the parameters characterizing the external forcing and the response of the system (the explored range is in parenthesis): the vertical vegetation limit Zc (0.02-0.2m), frequency of HWEs THWE (0-20yr), mean total water elevation ?̅? (1-2m), rate S of RSLR (0-0.02m/yr) and the imposed onshore wind, characterized by the ratio of the undisturbed shear velocity u*0 and the transport threshold ut (1.5-2.5), and by the fraction of the time rt the wind is above the transport threshold and sand is available.

MooreSupplementary Methods: Coastal Dune ModelThe coastal dune model describes the temporal evolution of the sand surface elevation h(x, y, t)–definedrelative to the mean high water level (MHWL)–and the cover fraction ρveg(x, y, t) for a single generic grassspecies. x is the cross-shore distance to the shoreline (x = 0), which separates the foreshore (x < 0) fromthe backshore (x > 0), and y is the alongshore coordinate.Fluid dynamics. The model uses a linear solution of the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations forthe turbulent boundary layer over smooth terrain to calculate the perturbation δτ of the undisturbed surfacewind shear stress τ 0 induced by the topography h. The surface shear stress τ is τ (h) = τ 0 + τ0δτ (h) (seeRef. 1 for details). For lee slopes steeper than the separation angle ∼ 20◦, non-linear hydrodynamic effectsare simply modeled by a separation streamline below which wind and flux are set to zero. Each streamlineis defined by a third-order polynomial connecting the brink with the ground at the reattachment point2.Shear stress partition. In the presence of vegetation, plants act as roughness elements that absorb part ofthe momentum transferred to the sand surface by the wind, effectively reducing the surface shear stress andthus the sand transport rate. For randomly distributed plants, and assuming the effective shelter area for oneplant is proportional to its basal area, the fraction τs of the surface shear stress acting on the sand decreaseswith the local vegetation cover fraction ρveg asτs = τ/(1 + Γρveg) (1)1where Γ is a dimensionless ‘roughness factor’ that describes the effectiveness of the vegetation in slowingdown the flow and thus in trapping sand. In the model, Γ = 16 is calculated from values of plant formdrag and geometry reported for creosote communities (see Ref. 1 and references therein; it is reasonable toexpect a similar value for coastal grasses and desert bushes due to a roughly similar plant geometry).Effect of wetting on the transport threshold. We further consider that at the shore, transport is naturallylimited by the elevation h relative to the watertable, as the transport threshold τt is much higher for wetgrains than for dry ones. This relation is captured by the simple phenomenological expressionτt(h) = τdt + (τwt − τdt ) exp (−(h + Hwater)/δw) (2)where τdt and τwt = 10τdt are the thresholds for dry and wet sand respectively, Hwater is the watertable depthrelative to the MHWL and δw = 0.05m characterizes the decrease in water content of the sand as a functionof elevation. At the watertable (h = −Hwater, relative to the MHWL) we get by definition τt = τwt , whereasfar above it τt → τdt .Aeolian sand transport. The sand flux is determined from the shear stress at the sand surface τs (Eq.1),the surface gradient ∇h and the transport threshold τt (Eq.2). It is well known that the sand flux qa over anerodible surface increases with the distance downwind as the saltation process spatially adjusts to the windforcing. This effect is modeled as∇ · qa = (qa + δa)(1− qa/qsat)/lsat (3)which describes the spatial relaxation of the sand flux toward an equilibrium ‘saturated’ value qsat over a‘saturation’ length lsat. The saturated flux and saturation length are defined as: qsat = Q(τs − τt)/τdt andlsat = Lτdt /(τs − τt), where Q(∇h) and L(∇h) are slope–dependent dimensional functions2. The smallterm δa ∼ 10−2qsat quantifies the direct sand entrainment in the absence of transport when the bed shearstress has just crossed the transport threshold. For simplicity in the formulation qa is defined as a volume,not mass, flux.2Storms. Storms are defined in the model as high water events (HWEs) with total water elevation R abovethe MHWL (R is defined relative to the MHWL). HWEs are considered periodic with period THWE and havea constant duration ∆T. R is randomly distributed according to an Erlang distribution R2R̄−3e−3R/R̄ (R̄ ismean total water elevation) which has an exponential tail, in agreement with Ref. 3, and filters tidal events(i.e. there are no events for R→ 0).Storm-induced sand transport. We derive a simple phenomenological expression to calculate the cross-shore net sand flux qst(x, y, t) for elevations between MHWL and R during high water events (HWE). Basedon Ref. 4 (see Ref. 5 for the validation of a similar formulation), we assume the net sand flux qst over manyswash cycles to be proportional to the cube of the average speed U of the uprushing wave front, timesthe time δt this particular location is submerged: qst ∝ U3δt/(gT), with gravity g and timescale T. Thesand flux is further weighted by a downslope contribution (1 − ∂xh/ tan (α)) that represents the tendencyof the surface to reach the equilibrium foreshore slope tan (α). From energy conservation (neglecting thedissipation due to bottom friction), the kinetic energy of the uprushing wave front is balanced by its potentialenergy. In that case U ∝√g(R− h) and δt ∝√(R− h)/g (Ref. 4), which lead to:qst = T−1(R− h)2(1− ∂xh/ tan (α)). (4)The timescale T is arbitrary (although much smaller than the timescale of aeolian transport) and we choosethe rescaled duration of HWEs (∆T/T = 100) to qualitatively reproduce the main erosional regimes de-scribed in Ref. 6 (Supplementary Fig. 5).Surface dynamics. Foreshore (x < 0): We assume the foreshore to be always at equilibrium (∂h/∂t = 0)with a constant shape defined by the initial condition. This assumption implies aeolian erosion is balancedby accretion in the swash zone. As a result, the simulated foreshore acts as a sand reservoir supplying anunlimited amount of sediment to the backshore, effectively feeding dune formation and post-storm recovery.Shoreline (x = 0): We assume, as a first approximation, that under relative sea level rise (RSLR) theshoreline follows Bruun’s rule7 and migrates landward at a rate ẋshore = 50S, proportional to the rate S ofRSLR with a prefactor within the typical range8. Backshore (x > 0): Following the timescale separation3between RSLR, aeolian and storm-induced transport, we calculate the change of the sand surface elevationh at the backshore from mass conservation as∂h∂t= −∂qst∂x(5)during HWEs, and as∂h∂t= −∇ · qa − S + ẋshore∂h∂x(6)otherwise. The last two terms in the right hand side of Eq. 6 describe the effects of relative sea level rise.Because we define the surface elevation relative to the sea level and the shoreline position, the surface effec-tively sinks under RSLR (term−S) while it apparently moves towards the shoreline (last term). Avalanches:For slopes steeper than the angle of repose 34◦, an additional dissipative flux models the surface relaxationdue to avalanches2.Vegetation dynamics. As a first approximation, we assume a single generic grass species with a coverfraction ρveg that is sensitive to sand erosion and accretion and that can increase up to the maximum coverρveg = 1 during a characteristic time tveg. We further assume plant growth is also sensitive to frequent salt-water inundation and thus to the proximity of the shoreline and to the elevation above MHWL. Therefore,plants can effectively grow only landward of the vegetation limit Lveg and in places higher than a minimumelevation Zc from MHWL. Thus,dρvegdt=1− ρvegtvegΘ(x− Lveg)Θ(h− Zc)−γHveg∣∣∣∣∂h∂t∣∣∣∣ (7)where γ is plant sensitivity to sand erosion/accretion, Hveg is the maximum plant height and the Heavisidefunction Θ(s) (1 for s > 0; 0 otherwise) defines the regions where plants can grow. Both the growthtime tveg and the sensitivity γ are in general a function of the erosion/accretion rate ∂h/∂t, which can bevaried for different plant species. However, we find that the results presented here are independent of theseconsiderations. Therefore, for simplicity and in agreement with Ref. 1, we use a constant growth timetveg = 3 days, and sensitivity γ = 1, with Hveg = 1m. We further assume vegetation dies in all placessubmerged during high water events.4Initial Condition. Sand surface (Eqs. 5 & 6): The sand surface elevation h is initially defined as aninclined plane h(x, y) = tan (α) x at the foreshore (x < 0), and as a flat surface h(x, y) = 0 at the backshore(x > 0), where α is the beach slope. In the simulations α = 1◦. Vegetation (Eq. 7): We assume no initialvegetation (ρveg = 0).Boundary conditions. Aeolian transport (Eq. 3): We assume no aeolian sand influx (qa = 0) at the mostseaward limit of the foreshore, where the surface elevation equals the mean low water level (MLWL) andthus the sand is effectively wet at all times and not available for aeolian transport. Storm-induced transport(Eqs. 4 & 5): We impose a Dirichlet boundary condition. During overwashes (R > H) the boundarycondition is h = 0 at both the upstream boundary (the shoreline) and the downstream one, at the landwardlimit of the simulation domain. During the erosional regime (R < H), the seaward condition is the same butthe landward one becomes qst = 0 at the line y(x) where h(x, y, t) = R seaward of the dune.Integration. We integrate the model within a two-dimensional domain large enough to include the result-ing morphology. The grid spacing and time step are typically∼ 1/4m and∼ 1/2 hour, respectively, and areselected to resolve the smallest length and temporal scales involved in the problem, the saturation length lsatand time l2sat/qsat. For simplicity all boundary conditions are uniform in the alongshore direction y.Parameters. We investigate model outcomes as function of the parameters characterizing the externalforcing and the response of the system (the explored range is in parenthesis): the vertical vegetation limit Zc(0.02-0.2m), frequency of HWEs THWE (0-20yr), mean total water elevation R̄ (1-2m), rate S of RSLR (0-0.02m/yr) and the imposed onshore wind, characterized by the ratio of the undisturbed shear velocity u∗0 andthe transport threshold ut (1.5-2.5), which is assumed constant and oriented along the cross-shore directionthroughout each simulation. Notice that by definition u∗0/ut =√τ0/τt where τ0 is the undisturbed bedshear stress and τt is the threshold. Simulation time is thus shorter than in more realistic wind conditions,where the wind intensity fluctuates daily and seasonally, beach sand could be wet (i.e. transport thresholdbecomes very large) or sand supply is limited. The conversion factor is loosely defined by the fraction ofthe time rt the wind is above the transport threshold and sand is available. Although the value rt = 0.02 istypically used it is important to note that this parameter essentially rescales time for all processes involved.5a b cf gSupplementary Figure 1.

The Hawaiian Islands provide a unique opportunity to study heterogeneity and demographics in a controlled environment due to the geographically closed borders and mostly uniform pandemic-induced governmental controls and restrictions.ObjectiveThe goal of the paper is to quantify the differences and similarities in the spread of COVID-19 among different Hawaiian islands as well as several other archipelago and islands, which could potentially help us better understand the effect of differences in social behavior and various mitigation measures. The approach should be robust with respect to the unavoidable differences in time, as the arrival of the virus and promptness of mitigation measures may vary significantly among the chosen locations. At the same time, the comparison should be able to capture differences in the overall pandemic experience.MethodsWe examine available data on the daily cases, positivity rates, mobility, and employ a compartmentalized model fitted to the daily cases to develop appropriate comparison approaches. In particular, we focus on merge trees for the daily cases, normalized positivity rates, and baseline transmission rates of the models.ResultsWe observe noticeable differences among different Hawaiian counties and interesting similarities between some Hawaiian counties and other geographic locations. The results suggest that mitigation measures should be more localized, that is, targeting the county level rather than the state level if the counties are reasonably insulated from one another. We also notice that the spread of the disease is very sensitive to unexpected events and certain changes in mitigation measures.ConclusionsDespite being a part of the same archipelago and having similar protocols for mitigation measures, different Hawaiian counties exhibit quantifiably different dynamics of the spread of the disease. One potential explanation is that not sufficiently targeted mitigation measures are incapable of handling unexpected, localized outbreak events. At a larger-scale view of the general spread of the disease on the Hawaiian island counties, we find very interesting similarities between individual Hawaiian islands and other archipelago and islands",,article,"Medicine, R, Science, Q",PLoS ONE,'Public Library of Science (PLoS)'

We tested the hypothesis that the descriptive ability of biogeographical factors for species is reduced as we move from native species, to archipelagic endemics and to single island endemics, because of the increasing importance of island ‘idiosyncrasies’ (i.e. unique features of each island shaping its biota, such as catastrophic volcanic eruptions, random colonization events, mega-landslides) in controlling the species richness of endemic species. This hypothesis was addressed using two approaches: (1) the island species–area relationships (ISARs), and (2) a multiple regression approach with variable selection based on permutation, to test the combined effects of island area with other biogeographical factors. Area was an effective predictor of species richness for all native species (R2 = 0.568 and R2 = 0.624 for pteridophytes and spermatophytes respectively), but its predictive capacity decreased for archipelagic endemics (R2 = 0.261 and R2 = 0.531) and single-island endemics (R2 = 0.084 and R2 = 0.438). The reduction of R2 from all native species, to archipelagic endemics and to single-island endemics was attributed to the increasing effects of the ‘idiosyncrasies’ of each island. The predictive capacity of multiple regression models increased with respect to ISARs, ranging from 27.3% (for single-island endemic pteridophytes) to 83.3% (all native pteridophytes), and included three to five predictors. Island area remained the most important variable for spermatophytes but was less important for pteridophytes. For pteridophytes, elevation was the most important predictor for native species, while isolation-related variables were the most important predictors for archipelagic endemics and single-island endemics.

However, because of the evolutionary time-scale for colonization events, the fit of individual species to a conceptual model of wind or rafting is difficult to assess. Here, we describe an alternative testable geological model for inter-island colonization that can result in larger effective founding population sizes than traditionally accepted colonization mechanisms. We then test for the fit of genetic data to this model using weevils from the Laparocerus tessellatus species complex.   LocationCanary Islands.   MethodsUsing a combination of geological data for the Canary Islands, and mtDNA data from a weevil radiation within the Canary Islands, we test three species-level predictions for mega-landslides as drivers of oceanic rafting between islands and subsequent speciation: (1) colonization should involve multiple female lineages, (2) founding lineages should have a common geographical origin, consistent with a mega-landslide event, and (3) colonization direction should be consistent with ocean currents.

island susceptibility hypothesis,484075261,A meta-analysis of insularity effects on herbivory and plant defences,10.1111/jbi.14003,"Moreira Tomé, Xoaquín, Castagneyrol, Bastien, García-Verdugo, Carlos, Abdala-Roberts, Luis",2021,"[Aim] Plants on islands are often subjected to lower levels of herbivory relative to those found at mainland sites. As a consequence, island plants are predicted to exhibit lower levels of physical or chemical defences, which renders them more susceptible to introduced herbivores. Yet, instances of high pressure by superabundant herbivores native to islands have been reported in many insular systems, which presumably would result in heightened plant defences. To date, no quantitative review has been conducted to determine how common these contrasting patterns are and their implications for the evolution of plant-herbivore interactions.[Location] Islands worldwide.[Taxon] Plants, insects, molluscs, mammals.[Methods] We conducted a meta-analysis of insularity effects on herbivory and plant defences by including studies that involved island-mainland comparisons of the same plant species in both environments (90% of cases), or insular endemics versus mainland congeners (10% of cases). We tested for differences between mammalian and invertebrate (mollusc or insect) herbivory as well as between plant chemical and physical defences by specifying comparisons based on the type of herbivore (vertebrate or invertebrate) or plant trait included in the study.[Results] Mammalian herbivory was significantly higher on islands than on mainlands. In contrast, no significant effect was observed on invertebrate herbivory. In addition, we found no significant difference in either plant physical or chemical defences between insular and mainland plants, though physical defences tended to be higher for plants on islands.[Main conclusions] All analysed mammal studies focused on species introduced to islands, suggesting greater susceptibility of insular plants to exotic mammals, whereas the lack of effects in the case of invertebrate herbivory suggests no difference in susceptibility to molluscs or insects between insular and mainland plants. Interestingly, plant trait patterns suggest a trend for increased physical defences by insular plants, possibly due to heightened pressure by exotic mammalian herbivores on islands, whereas chemical defences appear uncorrelated to differences in herbivory. These findings call for further experimental and observational studies measuring defences and herbivory for multiple sympatric plant species occurring at both mainland and island sites within a system, or comparing insular endemics to congeneric mainland species.This research was financially supported by a grant from the Regional Government of Galicia (IN607D 2016/001), a grant from the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities (RTI2018-099322-B-100) and the Ramón y Cajal Research Programme (RYC-2013-13230) to XM.

The core idea is to parameterize the similarity measure as a con-vex combination of rank-one matrices with specific sparsity structures. The parame-ters are then optimized with an approximate Frank-Wolfe procedure to maximally satisfy relative similarity constraints on the train-ing data. Our algorithm greedily incorpo-rates one pair of features at a time into the similarity measure, providing an efficient way to control the number of active features and thus reduce overfitting.

However, these methods are subject to the curse of dimensionality: as the number of features grows large, poor generalization is to be expected and training becomes intractable due to high computational and memory costs. In this paper, we propose a similarity learning method that can efficiently deal with high-dimensional sparse data. This is achieved through a parameterization of similarity functions by convex combinations of sparse rank-one matrices, together with the use of a greedy approximate Frank-Wolfe algorithm which provides an efficient way to control the number of active features. We show that the convergence rate of the algorithm, as well as its time and memory complexity, are independent of the data dimension. We further provide a theoretical justification of our modeling choices through an analysis of the generalization error, which depends logarithmically on the sparsity of the solution rather than on the number of features.

The similarity between two objects can then be expressed in terms of the similarity between their contexts. In this way, similarity pertains to the general notion that objects are similar if they are exchangeable in the data. We propose a scalable approach for calculating all relevant similarities among objects by relating them in a correlation graph that is transformed to a similarity graph. These graphs can express rich structural properties among objects. Specifically, we show that concepts - abstractions of objects - are constituted by groups of similar objects that can be discovered by clustering the objects in the similarity graph.

limiting similarity hypothesis,73893503,Efficiently and Effectively Learning Models of Similarity from Human Feedback\ud,,"Heim, Eric",2016,"Vital to the success of many machine learning tasks is the ability to reason about how objects relate. For this, machine learning methods utilize a model of similarity that describes how objects are to be compared. While traditional methods commonly compare objects as feature vectors by standard measures such as the Euclidean distance or cosine similarity, other models of similarity can be used that include auxiliary information outside of that which is conveyed through features. To build such models, information must be given about object relationships that is beneﬁcial to the task being considered. In many tasks, such as object recognition, ranking, product recommendation, and data visualization, a model based on human perception can lead to high performance. Other tasks require models that reﬂect certain domain expertise. In both cases, humans are able to provide information that can be used to build useful models of similarity. It is this reason that motivates similarity-learning methods that use human feedback to guide the construction of models of similarity.\ud \ud Associated with the task of learning similarity from human feedback are many practical challenges that must be considered. In this dissertation we explicitly deﬁne these challenges as being those of efﬁciency and effectiveness. Efﬁciency deals with both making the most of obtained feedback, as well as, reducing the computational run time of the learning algorithms themselves. Effectiveness concerns itself with producing models that accurately reﬂect the given feedback, but also with ensuring the queries posed to humans are those they can answer easily and without errors. After deﬁning these challenges, we create novel learning methods that explicitly focus on one or more of these challenges as a means to improve on the state-of-the-art in similarity-learning. Speciﬁcally, we develop methods for learning models of perceptual similarity, as well as models that reﬂect domain expertise.

These difference objects correspond to the first step in the process of approaching an ideal factorial level of similarity for any possible similarity measure [1], and switching between two different similarity measures is merely switching to a different property of the difference objects. Applying the concept of topological resolution for the original objects corresponds to generating equivalence classes among the difference objects, thus unifying two aspects of similarity evaluation: topological resolution and a generalization of the principle “Geometrical Similarity as Topological Equivalence”. This leads to the proof of a general theorem, establishing that all similarity measures correspond to some topological equivalence.

Within this paradigm, similar sequences are expected to share a large number of common substrings, or subsequences, or more complex patterns or motifs, and so on. The computational complexity of such measures varies, and it increases with the complexion of the patterns taken into account. At the low end of the spectrum, most measures based on the bags of shared substrings are typically afforded in linear time. This performance is no longer achievable as soon as some degree of distortion is accepted.

It is shown here that for some such measures bounds are achievable that are slightly better than O(n^2).

limiting similarity hypothesis,103671598,Sparse Online Relative Similarity Learning,,,2016,"Abstract—For many data mining and machine learning tasks, the quality of a similarity measure is the key for their perfor-mance. To automatically find a good similarity measure from datasets, metric learning and similarity learning are proposed and studied extensively. Metric learning will learn a Mahalanobis distance based on positive semi-definite (PSD) matrix, to measure the distances between objectives, while similarity learning aims to directly learn a similarity function without PSD constraint so that it is more attractive. Most of the existing similarity learning algorithms are online similarity learning method, since online learning is more scalable than offline learning. However, most existing online similarity learning algorithms learn a full matrix with d2 parameters, where d is the dimension of the instances. This is clearly inefficient for high dimensional tasks due to its high memory and computational complexity. To solve this issue, we introduce several Sparse Online Relative Similarity (SORS) learning algorithms, which learn a sparse model during the learning process, so that the memory and computational cost can be significantly reduced. We theoretically analyze the proposed algorithms, and evaluate them on some real-world high dimensional datasets. Encouraging empirical results demonstrate the advantages of our approach in terms of efficiency and efficacy. I",,text,,,

This thesis describes a set of techniques revolving around the notion of similarity. The first part involves modeling and learning similarity. We introduce Similarity Component Analysis (SCA), a Bayesian network for modeling instance-level similarity that does not observe the triangle inequality. Such a modeling choice avoids the transitivity bias in most existing similarity models, making SCA intuitively more aligned with the human perception of similarity. The second part involves learning and leveraging similarity for effective learning with limited data, with applications in computer vision and natural language processing. We first leverage incomplete and noisy similarity graphs in different modalities to aid the learning of object recognition models. In particular, we propose two novel zero-shot learning algorithms that utilize class-level semantic similarities as a building block, establishing state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale benchmark with more than 20,000 categories. As for natural language processing, we employ multi-task learning (MTL) to leverage unknown similarities between sequence tagging tasks.

We study here this problem in the situation where few labeled data (and potentially few unlabeled data as well) is available, a situation that arises in several practical contexts. We also provide a complete theoretical analysis of the proposed approach. It is indeed worth noting that the metric learning research field lacks theoretical guarantees that can be expected on the generalization capacity of the classifier associated to a learned metric. The theoretical framework of (e γ, τ)-good similarity functions has been one of the first attempts to draw a link between the properties of a similarity function and those of a linear classifier making use of it. In this paper, we extend this theory to a method where the metric and the separator are jointly learned in a semi-supervised way, setting that has not been explored before, and provide a theoretical analysis of this joint learning via Rademacher complexity.

We argue that to devise an effective way to measure the similarity between languages one should build a probabilistic model that tries to capture as much regular correspon-dence between the languages as possible. This approach yields two benefits. First, given a set of language data, for any two models, this gives a way of objectively determining which model is better, i.e., which model is more likely to be accurate and informative. Second, given a model, for any two languages we can determine, in a principled way, how close they are. The better models will be better at judg-ing similarity. We present experiments on data from three language families to sup-port these ideas. In particular, our results demonstrate the arbitrary nature of terms such as language vs. dialect, when applied to related languages. ",,text,,,

According to Lewis’s account, the truth-conditions for counterfactual conditionals are given in terms of the comparative overall similarity between possible worlds, which is in turn determined by various aspects of similarity between possible worlds. We argue that a function from aspects of similarity to overall similarity should satisfy certain plausible constraints while Arrow’s impossibility theorem rules out that such a function satisfies all the constraints simultaneously. We argue that a way out of this impasse is to represent aspectual similarity in terms of ranking functions instead of representing it in a purely ordinal fashion. Further, we argue against the claim that the determination of overall similarity by aspects of similarity faces a difficulty in addition to the Arrovian limitation, namely the incommensurability of different aspects of similarity.

In fact, the distance is the natural measure for dissimilarity. Generally, a pairwise relationship between two objects in learning tasks includes two aspects: similarity and dissimilarity. The similarity measure provides different information for pairwise relationships. However, similarity learning has been paid less attention in learning problems. In this work, firstly, we propose a general framework for similarity measure learning (SML).  Additionally, we define a generalized type of correlation as a similarity measure. By a set of parameters, generalized correlation provides flexibility for learning tasks. Based on this similarity measure, we present a specific algorithm under the SML framework, called correlation similarity measure learning (CSML), to learn a parameterized similarity measure over input space. A nonlinear extension version of CSML, kernel CSML, is also proposed. Particularly, we give a closed-form solution avoiding iterative search for a local optimal solution in the high-dimensional space as the previous work did.

Despite many approaches to similarity metric learning that have been proposed, there has been little theoretical study on the links between similarity metric learning and the classifica-tion performance of the resulting classifier. In this letter, we propose a regularized similarity learning formulation associated with general ma-trix norms and establish their generalization bounds. We show that the generalization error of the resulting linear classifier can be bounded by thederived generalizationboundof similarity learning. This shows that a good generalization of the learned similarity function guarantees a good classification of the resulting linear classifier. Our results extend and im-prove those obtained by Bellet, Habrard, and Sebban (2012). Due to the techniques dependent on the notion of uniform stability (Bousquet &amp; Elisseeff, 2002), the bound obtained there holds true only for the Frobe-nius matrix-norm regularization. Our techniques using the Rademacher complexity (Bartlett &amp; Mendelson, 2002) and its related Khinchin-type inequality enable us to establish bounds for regularized similarity learn-ing formulations associated with general matrix norms, including sparse L1-norm and mixed (2,1)-norm.

Experimentally, these methods significantly outperform the more classical methods based on distance or transformed distance preservation.This paper explains both theoretically and experimentally the reasons for these performances. In particular, it details (i) why the phenonomenon of distance concentration is an impediment towards effcient dimensionality reduction and (ii) how SNE and its variants circumvent this diffculty by using similarities that are invariant to shifts with respect to squared distances.

However, the factors underlying weapon diversity among species remain poorly understood, and a fundamental hypothesis to explain this diversity remains untested. Although weapons can serve multiple functions, an undeniably important function is their role in fights. Thus, a crucial hypothesis is that weapon diversification is driven by the evolution of weapon modifications that provide an advantage in combat (e.g. causing more damage). Here, we test this fighting-advantage hypothesis using data from 17 species of coreid bugs. We utilize the fact that male-male combat in coreids often results in detectable damage, allowing us to link different weapon morphologies to different levels of damage among species. We find that certain weapon morphologies inflict much more damage than others, strongly supporting the fighting-advantage hypothesis. Moreover, very different weapon morphologies can inflict similarly severe amounts of damage, leading to a weapon performance landscape with multiple performance peaks. This multi-peak pattern could potentially drive different lineages towards divergent weapon forms, further increasing weapon diversity among species. Overall, our results may help explain how sexually selected weapons have evolved into the diversity of forms seen today.12 month embargo; published: 27 January 2021This item from the UA Faculty Publications collection is made available by the University of Arizona with support from the University of Arizona Libraries.

JonesRethinking the Development of Weapons and Their ImpactConventional weaponry may be effectively harmful to our enemies, but pollution from these weapons is severely impacting the environment as well.As you read about the history of humans, you see very early on that humans are naturally “tool users.”  More specifically, humans used tools as a means of subsis-tence and survival. Even today humans use tools to extend their capabilities beyond imagination. axes and knife-like tools made from stone and flint could be used to pound or hammer or cut. The earliest humans were hunter-gatherers and for survival had to capture or kill “an evening meal.” Spears, bows, and arrows became tools for hunting to kill larger prey for food and subsistence. However primitive, these early weapons would soon be used against other hu-mans to defend territorial domains, to defend against other warring groups, or for protection against large predator animals.The “inconvenient truth”  we must face as a society is that weapons are necessary as we defend our country from for-eign as well as domestic enemies. Whether it is a catastroph-ic event such as 9/11, a shooting on a college campus, or our commitments to help our allies overseas during wartime, our military and police need weapons to defend against these ad-versaries. However, we can also note that weapons are used for recreation as well—in hunting and shooting competitions for example. Given the enormous number of weapons used for protection or recreation, can we expect that conventional weapons are harmful to the environment? absolutely, in many ways, and have been since the Greeks used sulfur mix-tures to produce suffocating fumes in the Trojan War (431 BC) (Harigel, 2001).  Conventional weaponry may be effectively harmful to our enemies, but pollution from these weapons is severely impacting the environment as well. Some of these weapons include chemical, biological, depleted uranium, landmines, nuclear, jet fighters, and even the conventional lead bullets fired from rifles and handguns. “It is estimated that the Pen-tagon generates five times more toxins than the five major U.S. chemical companies combined” (Hay-Edie, 2002). The U.S. military is the “largest single source” of environmental pollution in the United States. It is estimated that the cost to clean up military-related sites costs approximately $500 bil-lion dollars (Hay-Edie, 2002).Chemical Weapons  although the disposal of chemical weapons in the ocean ended in 1970, there is still concern about the potential hazards they may have on human health and safety as well as ocean life (Bearden, 2007). Following World Wars I and II the most effective and efficient way to dispose of chemical weapons was to dump them in the ocean. Between 1945 and 1970, our oceans became the dumping grounds for chemi- technology and engineering teacher     november 201113cal weapons—some of which were known to be leaking and/or damaged and posing immediate risk to those handling the weapons. The U.S. contributed 93,995 tons, France 9,250 tons, Britain 122,508 tons, and Russia 70,500 tons to the ocean floor. The United States has also dumped approximate-ly 100,000 tons (the equivalent to 39 railroad cars) in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of New Jersey, California, Florida, South Carolina, India, Italy, Norway, Denmark, Japan, and australia (Harigel, 2001). Specific locations of dumping are not known, making it difficult to ascertain exactly who is at risk. While some of these weapons are water soluble, others are not and can remain active for many years. Others are denser than seawater and may remain on the floor of the ocean, where they pose a greater threat. In addition, colder temperatures prevent the degradation of the chemicals (Bearden, 2007). Ocean currents can carry contamination far beyond the original site where chemicals were dumped. In the Baltic Sea, fishermen have reported catching “encrusted sulphur mustard” in fishing nets while trawling, posing threats to sea life as well as humans (Bearden, 2007). as these weapons continue to deteriorate, they threaten our seas and the ocean life, extending threats to humans and the environ-ment around them.  In addition to the disposal of chemical weapons, the use of chemical weapons during wartime has long-lasting effects as well. While harmful chemicals were used to gas humans to death in Nazi concentration camps, one of the more recent well-known uses of chemical weapons is agent Orange. It is estimated that the U.S. military used 19 million gallons of agent Orange in the Vietnam War between 1962 and 1971. This herbicide killed trees and other vegetation, allowing for troops to better see the enemy. However, it also had an over-whelming effect on human and wildlife populations. We are still dealing with the lingering effects of this chemical nearly 50 years later. agent Orange contaminated the Vietnamese soil and water, passing into the food supplies, and specifically contaminating fish that the Vietnamese eat as a basic staple. However, the contamination of the human population is very clear as well. We see serious health effects in the Vietnamese people as well as our own military families that were affected by this harmful chemical. These health issues include, but are not limited to, cancer and serious birth defects  (N.a., N.D.).  another use of “chemicals” to harm human populations and the environment occurred on September 11, 2001. When terrorists used commercial airliners to attack the World Trade Center, the explosion released chemical agents in “90,000 liters of jet fuel [that] burned at temperatures around 1,000 degrees C” (Enzler, 2006). This fuel explosion released toxins into the air. Clouds of gaseous particles continued to form and expand over much of Manhattan and Brooklyn, exposing everyone in their path to dangerous chemicals for weeks. Some of the effects have been seen in rescue workers suffering from respiratory diseases; however, it may be years before we see the full effects of this act of terrorism on the human population and environment that was exposed.Biological WeaponsBiological weapons are categorized into three basic types: spore-forming bacteria; vegetative bacteria (nonspore-form-ing); and viruses (Stuart, 2005). Studies have indicated that survival of these agents increases in air, water, textiles, and in soil (Stuart, 2005). Biological weapons may be more harm-Figure 1. Chemical weapons are the most insidious of weapons, as their presence is not obvious. They are hidden from view, and they may be in the form of gases, liquids, and powders that lie in wait for unsuspecting military or civilian personnel. Their effects may be im-mediate in paralyzing a human or animal or cause a lingering death and lead to extensive environmental damage.

They spread disease and infections that cannot be detected immediately and lie in the environment around us for years, continu-ing to infect humans and the environment. In addition, it is very difficult to predict the impact of these weapons since viability depends on physiological factors in both the agent and the host at the time of contamination. Hence, sampling will result in more actual, accurate data instead of predicting what the hazards may be to the environment (Stuart, 2005). In addition to wartime weapon development, these agents have been developed to control illegal crops (i.e. poppy fields in afghanistan and the coca plant in Columbia). However, biological weapons also spread disease and destroy the environment around them; they are just as much a threat to humans as they are to ecosystems and wildlife. Biological weapons applied on a large scale can wipe out entire popula-tions quickly and without forewarning. Sometimes the ef-fects are not known for months or perhaps even years. This, in particular, makes predicting their impact very difficult.Depleted Uranium Used during the Gulf War (approximately 600,000 lbs.), depleted uranium (DU) has a half-life of 4.5 billion years, making this a long-term problem. In afghanistan, there is evidence that DU ammunition has been used, causing con-tamination to the environment and “long-term health haz-ards” (Hay-Edie, 2002). It is the by-product of the extraction process after natural uranium and extract-enriched uranium are combined for nuclear fuel and weapons (Pesic, 2005). DU is delivered with conventional weapons (i.e., tank rounds, machine guns, Gatling guns, artillery, and even sniper rifles) and significantly increases the “lethal range” of these conven-tional weapons (Pesic, 2005). Upon impact, DU converts to radioactive dust, which is easily ingested. The World Health Organization has suggested that children are the most vul-nerable to DU due to the fact that “typical hand-to-mouth activity in inquisitive play could lead to high DU ingestion from contaminated soil” (N.a., N.D.). Biological effects of ingestion are both radiological and chemical and may include kidney failure and cancers related to the immune system, blood, and/or bone (Pesic, 2005).Landminesa passionate cause of the late Princess Diana of Great Britain was to highlight the fact that landmines pollute the world. Sixty (60) to 110 million landmines cover the ground around the world, including hundreds of thousands littering the fields and mountains of afghanistan (Hay-Edie, 2002). annu-ally, landmines are responsible for over 26,000 deaths across the globe, not including wild and domesticated animals. They account for other issues related to deforestation, soil erosion, and water pollution as well. These mines account for not only physical and emotional injury in humans and animals, but also leave farmlands rendered useless, creating severe short-ages of food and thus causing malnutrition in some areas of the world.a relatively new development that has appeared in the wars in Iraq and afghanistan are IEDs or “improvised explo-Figure 2. As military planners, scientists, and engineers as well as terrorists develop new weapons, researchers are looking for ways to counter those weapons with new technologies. Shown here is a Foster-Miller Talon Mk.II searching an area while a Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) provides a 360-degree view as the two work together to search for a simulated improvised explosive device (Credit: Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division).

Unlike land mines that lie dormant until some unsuspecting soldier or civilian steps on them, IEDs can be triggered by remote wireless control, push buttons, or trip wires. They result in devastatingly serious injury or death. To counter such weapon threats, new technologies are being developed to discover and disarm such weapons. Figure 2 shows a micro air vehicle searching for a simulated IED.Nuclear Weapons  The danger of nuclear weapons is astounding. a global nuclear war has the potential to kill more than three bil-lion people—half of the world’s population. The additional radiation that would remain in the air, soil, and water would affect the surviving population. Nuclear weapons would wipe out land and water supplies, rendering the world without the ability to grow food and resulting in starvation in much of the population. Life would literally cease to exist on earth.Nearly seventy years ago, in the midst of World War II, a decision was made to explore and develop a nuclear weapon that would eventually become the world’s most powerful and devastating weapon. It was feared that adolf Hitler’s Germany would develop a similar weapon first. Subsequently would begin what is now known as the “nuclear age.” The Manhattan Project brought together engineers, scientists, and technicians from around the United States to develop an atomic weapon of such scale that it would bring to a close a global war. It is important to note that nuclear science was in its infancy at this time, and little was known about the health effects of radiation and nuclear materials on humans. The construction of the world’s first atomic bomb began at the Los alamos Laboratory in New Mexico under the direction of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer (aCHRE, 2011).Jet FightersJet fuel used to power jet fighters is as toxic to the environ-ment as any other weapon. Jet fuel pollutes the air, soil, and water around us. Many times, the military has been known to “dump” fuel from jets in bodies of water as well as over unpopulated land areas. a typical jet fighter burns 105 liters (or 27.74 U.S. gallons) of jet fuel per minute (1,664.40 gal-lons per hour), while a C-17 cargo jet burns 11,350 liters per hour (or 2,998.35 U.S. gallons) (Biello, 2011). To put this in perspective, one typical U.S. car burns .8 gallons per hour if running idle. Given this tremendous amount of fuel that is burned by military jets, we can imagine the impact emis-sions and dumping of fuel has on our environment. However, the military has announced that it is reducing its carbon footprint in several ways. First, Navy Secretary Ray Mabus announced in 2009 that the Navy would be building the “Green Hornet,” a biofuel-powered F/a-18 jet fighter ready for flight in three years. This initiative is expected to save ap-proximately 127,000 barrels of fuel per year and provide for a much cleaner-burning fuel source to help the war on pollu-tion (Tirella, 2009). In addition, the military is also expected to convert its entire fleet of 50,000 vehicles to electric and hybrids by the year 2015 (Tirella, 2009).Lead Bullets Lead has been determined to be one of the most deadly toxins on earth. In the 20th century it is estimated that 20 million tons of lead bullets have been fired in the United States (Virginia Tech, 2004). Researchers at Virginia Tech say that there are approximately 9,000 military and nonmilitary shooting ranges in the United States. “Some 60,000 metric tons of lead are expended by shooting, so there are lead bul-lets everywhere” (Virginia Tech, 2004). Studying a shooting range in Blacksburg, Va, researchers found that lead is ab-Figure 3. Shown is an aerial photo of the second bombing of Naga-saki, Japan in August, 1945. The unusual but characteristic plume of a nuclear explosion creates devastatingly high winds and tempera-tures at ground-zero level. The resulting destruction is immediate, and the effects of radiation linger (Library of Congress). [See www.loc.gov/pictures/item/98506956/] technology and engineering teacher     november 201116sorbed in the “top few inches of the soil and does not migrate beyond that” (Virginia Tech, 2004). In addition, significant amounts were found in trees, which means that when trees are cut down, they will contain lead contaminate.a study published by the Environmental Working Group in 2001 suggests that people who regularly visit the shooting range as well as their families are susceptible to lead expo-sure. Lead settles into clothing, footwear, and other items of clothing typically worn to the range. “Take-home exposure” is said to be one of the leading causes of secondary lead poi-soning (Diaz, 2001). However, direct poisoning can be found in those who cast their own bullets, as “melting lead pro-duces a fume which can remain in the air for several hours” (Diaz, 2001). an example of secondary exposure can be found in a day-care center in Clearwater, FL. This day-care center was forced to close because a shooting range located next door was emitting lead-contaminated air into the play-ground of the day-care center. Children received blood tests to determine contamination and extent of contamination (Diaz, 2001). Even construction workers in charge of demoli-tion of a shooting range tested positive for lead contamina-tion, as did their children.Both studies above collected data from a contained area, a shooting range. What about the areas where hunting and wars take place? In these areas, we see less control and per-haps more widespread contamination from lead bullets fired from manual and automatic weapons.  So, what are we doing to be more environmentally conscious while maintaining weapons to protect against our enemies and continuing to allow for recreational use as well?  BaE Systems, a British arms manufacturer, is designing re-duced-lead bullets and grenades with reduced smoke, as well as lower-toxin rockets in hopes of lowering carbon emissions (Ungoed-Thomas, 2006). Dr. Debbie allen, Director of Cor-porate Social Responsibility says, “Weapons are going to be used, and when they are, we try to make them as safe for the user as possible, to limit the collateral damage, and to impact as little as possible on the environment” (Ungoed-Thomas, 2006).Design Initiative for Studentsas students enter the class they will see an image of a baby born with birth defects such as missing limbs—a shocking photograph with a caption below similar to this one: “The re-sults of the war ten years ago.” These kinds of images are very graphic but at the same time very effective in highlighting the impact of weaponry and other toxic materials. after a few minutes, ask the students if they know who is re-sponsible for the situation of the baby and how we can have such tragic images ten years after active war. assign groups of three, where students will be responsible to investigate, conduct research, and come up with solutions to the issue. Once solutions are being identified, they should be presented to the rest of the class, and a plan of work should be devel-oped to solve the problem. Provide ideas, such as a day trip to a recycling facility, where students can see alternative materials that can replace toxic or nonbiodegradable ma-terials. Introduce the students to several organizations and provide information about recycling, environmental issues, and balancing environmental concerns and social concerns with technological advancement.activities such as the one described above are easy to corre-late with ITEEa’s technological literacy standards. See Table 1 for correlations with ITEEa’s STL standards.SummaryEven though war is a tragedy on its own, sometimes it can be the only solution to prevent the worst. It is vital that we promote the manufacturing of biodegradable weapons that don’t pollute the environment and also strengthen the laws that prohibit the use of toxic and other chemical weapons; otherwise, the direct output of this concept—the existence of humanity in the years to come—will be questionable.

Keywords: eyewitness identification, weapon focus effect, unusualness hypothesis, confidence and accuracyOn August 16, 2008, a group of men robbed another group while brandishing a bro-ken bottle (Ratcliffe, 2008). On May 18, 2010, a man was attacked with a tire iron (“City deputies arrest three after fight with tire iron,” 2010). More famously, on December 14, 2008, an Iraqi journalist used his shoes as weapons, throwing them separately at President George W. Bush during a news conference in Baghdad (“Iraqi journalist throws shoes at Bush in Baghdad,” 2008). Bush ducked away from both shoes, narrowly avoiding being struck in the face. A common thread among these incidents is the use of a typical object as a weapon.The psychological literature includes several studies on the weapon focus effect ([WFE]; e.g., Carlson & Carlson, 2012, 2014; Erickson, Lampinen, & Leding, 2014; Author note: Curt A.

E-mail: curt.carlson@tamuc.edu© Applied Psychology in Criminal Justice, 2016, 12(2)88 THE WEAPON FOCUS EFFECTHope & Wright, 2007; Loftus, Loftus, & Messo, 1987; see meta-analyses by Steblay, 1992;Fawcett, Russell, Peace, & Christie, 2013). A common finding is that eyewitness memory is worse for crimes in which a weapon was present. The leading explanation for the WFE is the unusualness hypothesis, such that when an unusual or unexpected object is present, eyewitness memory becomes worse for other details, including the perpetrator’s appearance (e.g., Mitchell, Livosky, & Mather, 1998; Pickel, 1998, 1999). This hypothesis is derived from the basic attention literature showing that non-distinctive objects draw less attention than distinctive objects (Antes, 1974; Loftus & Mackworth, 1978). The distrac-tion created by a distinctive or unexpected object reduces the amount of attention devoted to other elements of the crime, including the perpetrator’s face. The result is worse eyewit-ness recall of details from the crime and, less consistently, lower eyewitness identification accuracy (e.g., Fawcett et al., 2013). No studies have investigated the possibility that a WFE also could result from a crime involving a typical object used in an unusual manner (e.g., as a weapon), as in the above examples. Our goal was to conduct the first study to focus on this important issue. This study serves both a theoretical and an applied purpose. First, we tested an extension of the unusualness hypothesis (a typical object used in a distinctive manner), as all studies so far addressing this hypothesis have involved distinctive objects rather than distinctive ac-tions, per se. Second, many real-world crimes are committed with everyday objects used as weapons, and it is important to understand the impact these objects could have on eyewit-ness memory. Police might expect an eyewitness to have worse memory for the perpetrator if he was using an obvious weapon, but not necessarily if a non-weapon was used instead. Before describing our study, we will bring the reader up to speed on the WFE as typically studied, highlighting tests of the unusualness hypothesis.The Weapon Focus EffectPsychological scientists have known for decades that a weapon can distract eyewit-nesses, and the majority of those in the criminal justice system have caught on (Desmarais & Read, 2011). Loftus et al. (1987) conducted the first controlled experiments to provide evidence of a WFE. They presented a series of slides to participants in two experiments depicting a man approaching a cashier in a fast-food restaurant. In one version, he hands over a check; in the other, he points a gun at the cashier. Eye-tracker data from the first experiment showed that participants focused more on the gun than the check and less on the man’s face in the gun condition. The second experiment found an effect on eyewitness identification, such that the participants who had seen the gun were worse at choosing the man from a lineup compared to those in the check condition.Several later laboratory experiments replicated the WFE, at least in terms of eye-witness recall. For example, Kramer, Buckhout, & Eugenio (1990) conducted several ex-periments in which a slide presentation depicted a man walking down a hallway with either a magazine or bloody meat cleaver. When the object was visible for several slides, partici-pants were worse at later recalling details from the slides (other than the central object). Unlike Loftus et al. (1987), they did not find an effect for eyewitness identification, a point to which we return below. © Applied Psychology in Criminal Justice, 2016, 12(2) CARLSON, ET AL. 89As evidence accumulated in support of the WFE, some researchers turned their at-tention to testing the unusualness hypothesis (e.g., Hope & Wright, 2007; Mitchell et al., 1998; Pickel, 1998, 1999; Shaw & Skolnick, 1994). Mitchell et al. (1998) presented a video of an interaction between two businessmen, with one of them presenting a gun or a stick of celery. Due to the fact that neither of these objects were expected in the context of the business meeting, both conditions led to lower recall of other aspects of the scene. Pickel (1998) replicated this effect with a raw chicken presented in a hair salon. Importantly, Pickel (1999) extended the unusualness hypothesis by showing that a weapon will not al-ways draw attention; rather, it depends on whether the weapon is unusual given the context. To illustrate, she supported the WFE when a handgun was presented at a sporting event, but not a shooting range. In a second experiment, the WFE occurred when a priest was shown with a gun, but not when a police officer had the gun. Finally, Hope and Wright (2007) showed with a dual task condition (i.e., requiring participants to keep track of numbers on their screen while also paying attention to a slide presentation) that attention indeed is distracted in the presence of a weapon or unusual item, but not for a typical object.Generally, these studies supported the WFE with a memory questionnaire involving several recall or recognition questions about the scene, but not with a test of eyewitness identification from a lineup. This likely was due to the combination of three factors. First, a memory questionnaire is more sensitive to the WFE than is a single recognition test in the form of a lineup (Pickel, 2007; Steblay, 1992). Second, studies typically tested eyewitness memory with only a perpetrator-present lineup, which provides half of the data (i.e., only correct identifications of the perpetrator) required to determine eyewitness identification accuracy. A perpetrator-absent lineup also is required so that false alarms (i.e., choosing an innocent suspect) can be calculated. These then can be combined with correct identifica-tions in several ways to calculate various estimates of overall accuracy. Third, many ex-periments involved approximately 20-30 participants per cell, which is not enough power to detect an effect based on only one data point collected per participant (Wilcox, 2001). More recent studies have featured high-powered experiments investigating the WFE with both perpetrator-present and perpetrator-absent lineups (Carlson & Carlson, 2012, 2014; Carlson, Dias, Weatherford, & Carlson, in press-a; Carlson, Young, Weatherford, Carlson, Bednarz, & Jones, in press-b; Erickson, Lampinen, & Leding, 2014). All of these studies have found that eyewitness identification accuracy is worse in a weapon condition compared to a typical object condition. Erickson et al. (2014) is the only one of these stud-ies to also investigate the unusualness hypothesis. Participants took part in an online game in which they played the role of a bartender serving drinks to several individuals shown in a slide presentation. One of the customers served as the target individual, presenting an empty glass, a gun, or a rubber chicken (tested between-participants). They partially sup-ported the unusualness hypothesis, such that participants chose an innocent suspect more often after seeing either the gun or the chicken, but were no less likely to correctly choose the perpetrator after seeing the chicken.We are aware of only two studies involving a typical object used as a weapon (Carlson & Carlson, 2012; Kramer et al., 1990). Kramer et al. (1990; Experiment 1) pre-© Applied Psychology in Criminal Justice, 2016, 12(2)90 THE WEAPON FOCUS EFFECTsented a mock crime as a series of slides depicting a small group of men playing cards. After the game, a man carrying a bottle approaches another man and smashes the bottle over his head. When the bottle was clearly visible (they also had a low visibility condition), participants were worse on a later recall test and gave a more impoverished description of the perpetrator. There was no effect on eyewitness identification, though they presented only a perpetrator-present lineup, and there was a floor effect for correct identifications (i.e., the perpetrator was not chosen more than chance for any condition). Carlson and Carlson (2012) included a similar condition: A video depicts a man approaching the par-ticipants’ point of view (POV), then apparently strikes the POV with a beer bottle. Unlike Kramer et al. (1990), they did not find a WFE, even though they tested memory with both perpetrator-present and perpetrator-absent lineups.The Present StudyNeither Kramer et al. (1990) nor Carlson and Carlson (2012) had the explicit goal of extending the WFE to a typical object used in an atypical manner, such as an object not typically considered to be a weapon actually used as a weapon. Our goal was to design an experiment to test this possibility directly, in addition to providing another test of the WFE and unusualness hypothesis as typically studied (i.e., by including a weapon condition and an unusual object condition). As described below, our participants viewed a video in which a target individual (i.e., the perpetrator) is seated at a desk in a home office (a) stapling papers with a black stapler, then standing to hand the stapler to the participants’ POV (typi-cal object, typical action); (b) stapling papers with the black stapler, then standing and ap-pearing to strike the participants’ POV with the stapler (typical object, atypical action); (c) playing with a child’s toy stuffed animal, then standing and handing it to the participants’ POV (atypical, non-weapon object); or (d) holding a black handgun, then standing and pointing it at the participants’ POV (weapon condition).We tested four hypotheses. First, we expected to replicate the WFE in the form of worse eyewitness identification accuracy in the gun condition compared to the typical object/action condition. Second, we sought to support the unusualness hypothesis as typi-cally defined by finding worse eyewitness identification accuracy for the atypical object (toy) condition compared to the typical object/action condition. Third, we expected a WFE for the typical object/atypical action (stapler used as a weapon) compared to the typical object/action (stapler used only as a stapler). Finally, we also collected confidence after every lineup decision in order to assess the confidence-accuracy (CA) relationship. We sought to support recent WFE research by finding a strong CA relationship regardless of condition (Carlson et al., in press-ab). We describe our rationale for this final hypoth-esis in the Results section.METHODParticipantsStudents (N = 963) attending one of two U.S. universities participated in the ex-periment for course credit. Data from 113 participants were eliminated due to failures to correctly answer manipulation check questions at the end of the experiment regarding the © Applied Psychology in Criminal Justice, 2016, 12(2) CARLSON, ET AL. 91mock crime video. Data analysis proceeded on the data from the remaining 850 partici-pants (74% female; M age = 21.1, SD = 5.8; 64% Caucasian, 18% African-American, 8% Hispanic/Latino, 8% Other/Undisclosed). We received approval to conduct this experiment from both universities’ Insitutional Review Boards. MaterialsThe second author recorded a video (no audio) from a first person, point of view (POV). The POV enters the house through the garage and proceeds down a hallway and into a home office. Each version of the video is identical in these respects, and a man al-ways is seen seated at the desk in the office, facing the POV. Our manipulation involved the object with which the man is interacting, and what he does with it. In one version (typical object/action), he is seen stapling papers with a black stapler, and as the POV approaches, he stands up and hands the stapler to the POV. The second version (typical object/unusual action) also shows him stapling papers, but this time he stands up and appears to strike the POV in the head with the stapler. In the third version (unusual object) the man is playing with a toy stuffed animal, then he stands and hands it over to the POV. Our final version (weapon) shows the man sitting at the desk, then he picks up a black handgun from the desk (same size and color as stapler from other conditions), stands and points it at the POV. See Figure 1 for images from each condition. Each version ends immediately after the man stands and completes the action with the object. Each version is 25 seconds in duration, and a frontal view of the man’s face is clearly visible from about 1-2 meters away for the final 7 seconds. The actor portraying the target/perpetrator was instructed to maintain a neutral expression in every condition.Figure 1. Screen shots from the video conditions.

Several research as-sistants provided an independent description of his face, which we combined into the fol-lowing modal description: Middle-aged, White male, about 6-foot tall, medium build, bald or balding. We provided this description to another research assistant who had not seen any of the videos. She searched the Arkansas Department of Corrections database (Arkansas Department of Corrections, 2016) for faces that matched this description, yielding dozens of matches. The original group of research assistants chose one face from this group that best matched the man from the video. This face became our designated innocent suspect. We used the remaining faces from the database as foils to construct five perpetrator-present and five perpetrator-absent (containing the innocent suspect) lineups. Each lineup con-tained six individuals: The perpetrator or the designated innocent suspect and a unique set of five foils.We presented the 10 lineups to a group of 83 participants, independent from the group who later participated in the experiment. Each lineup was presented individually, preceded by the modal description (the mock crime video was not shown). Participants were instructed to simply choose the member of each lineup that they thought best matched the description. From their choices, we calculated lineup fairness based on Tredoux’s E’ (Tredoux, 1998), which ranges from 1 (very biased lineup) to the nominal lineup size of six (very fair lineup). We chose the fairest perpetrator-present lineup (E = 4.41, 95%; CI: 3.71-5.44) and perpetrator-absent lineup (E = 4.69, 95%; CI: 3.87-5.94) for use in the experiment.ProcedureSurveyMonkey hosted the experiment online, and each student participated via computer in a location of their choice (except we selected an option in SurveyMonkey to prevent the use of mobile devices). Following random assignment to condition, par-ticipants provided informed consent and then were instructed to pay close attention to a video on the following screen, which was coded to take up most of the screen. Following the video, they worked on anagrams of U.S. States for 5-10 minutes. At this point they received instructions that the upcoming lineup “may or may not contain the man from the video” and that they could either choose one of the lineup members or reject the lineup. The next screen contained the six-person simultaneous lineup (2x3 array), which either contained the perpetrator or the designated innocent suspect. Immediately following their lineup decision, participants entered their confidence on a 0-100% scale (10% increments) and then answered manipulation check questions: “What object did the man have? What did he do with it?” Finally, participants answered questions regarding their sex, age, and race/ethnicity.Design and AnalysisThis experiment featured a 4 (object/action in video: handgun, toy, stapler used as a stapler, and stapler used as a weapon) x 2 (lineup: perpetrator-present versus perpetrator-absent lineup) between-subjects factorial design. We first analyzed the binary (choose sus-pect or not) lineup identification data with logistic regression and individual chi-squares. We then conducted signal detection analysis of the correct and false identification rates to © Applied Psychology in Criminal Justice, 2016, 12(2) CARLSON, ET AL. 93yield estimates of sensitivity (d’) and response bias. In order to evaluate the confidence-accuracy relationship, we also presented confidence-accuracy characteristic (CAC) curves (Mickes, 2015), which will be described in more detail below.RESULTSLogistic Regression and Chi-Square AnalysisWe first conducted two separate logistic regressions: One on the perpetrator-present data (correct IDs coded as 1; all other lineup decisions coded as 0) and one on the perpetra-tor-absent data (false IDs of the innocent suspect coded as 1; all other decisions coded as 0). If a logistic regression yielded a significant effect, we followed up with chi-squares to investigate pairwise differences. All p-values are 2-tailed. Table 1 contains all proportions and frequencies for all lineup decisions.Table 1.

IDs=IdentificationsParticipants chose the perpetrator an equivalent number of times across the four conditions, Wald (3) = 0.46, p = .93, but our manipulation did influence the likelihood of choosing the innocent suspect, Wald (3) = 8.95, p = .03. Specifically, participants were more likely to choose the innocent suspect after seeing the gun in the video, compared to all three other conditions: toy, χ2(1, N = 221) = 7.97, p = .006, ϕ = .19, stapler used as a stapler (marginally), χ2(1, N = 236) = 3.18, p = .08, ϕ = .12, and stapler used as a weapon (margin-ally), χ2(1, N = 217) = 3.43, p = .07, ϕ = .13. These results partially replicate Erickson et al. (2014), who also found an effect on innocent suspect identifications, but not perpetrator identifications. However, they found that both a novel object (rubber chicken) and weapon increased false identifications, whereas we supported only the weapon effect, not finding an effect for the toy. Maass and Kohnken (1989) also found a weapon effect for false iden-tifications, but they only used perpetrator-absent lineups, so it is unknown whether or not there would have been an effect on perpetrator identifications too. Overall our findings are in line with a meta-analysis of the WFE literature by Fawcett et al. (2013), which found that weapons produced numerically (but nonsignificantly) greater impairment on memory compared to other unusual objects. But a stronger test of our hypotheses will come about with signal detection analysis, which combines correct and false identification rates into estimates of sensitivity (i.e., the ability to discriminate between innocent and guilty sus-© Applied Psychology in Criminal Justice, 2016, 12(2)94 THE WEAPON FOCUS EFFECTpects) and response bias (defined here as the likelihood of choosing either innocent or guilty suspect). Signal Detection AnalysisThe toy yielded the highest sensitivity (d’ = 1.64, 95%; CI: 1.61, 1.68), followed by the stapler used as a weapon (d’ = 1.47, 95%; CI: 1.45, 1.50), and the stapler used as a sta-pler (d’ = 1.32, 95%; CI: 1.30, 1.34). In replication of the WFE, the handgun reduced sensi-tivity (d’ = 1.01, 95%; CI: 1.00, 1.03) compared to all other conditions. In other words, the overall ability of our participants to choose the perpetrator rather than the innocent suspect was best after seeing the video with the man playing with the toy, whereas their accuracy was worst after seeing the video with the man pointing the gun. Based on the unusualness hypothesis, we expected that the toy condition would produce sensitivity equivalent to the gun condition, and lower than the typical object/action condition. These results indicate that our distinctive object manipulation did not produce a WFE. Rather, accuracy was un-expectedly boosted by the presence of the toy. In terms of response bias (overall choosing of perpetrator or innocent suspect), all conditions were conservative, with the toy producing the highest choosing criterion (c = .41, 95%; CI: .39, .43), followed by the stapler as stapler (c = .31, 95%; CI: .30, .32), and stapler as weapon (c = .27, 95%; CI: .26, .29) conditions. The gun produced the least conservative responding (c = .13, 95%; CI: .12, .14). In other words, after seeing the man playing with the toy, participants were least likely to choose either the perpetrator or the innocent suspect, but after seeing the man pointing the gun, they were most likely to choose either perpetrator or innocent suspect.Confidence-Accuracy Characteristic CurvesEyewitness confidence is a moderately-strong indicator of accuracy, given that con-fidence is assessed immediately after the lineup decision and under fairly well-controlled conditions (e.g., Brewer & Wells, 2006; Wixted, 2016; Wixted, Mickes, Clark, Gronlund, & Roediger, 2015). In other words, when participant-eyewitnesses choose a suspect from a lineup, and report high confidence (i.e., 90-100%), they are likely to be correct in their identification. However, historically there was thought to be a weak relationship between confidence and accuracy, though this was based on a simple statistic (the point-biserial correlation coefficient; see meta-analysis by Sporer, Penrod, Read, & Cutler, 1995), now understood to be a poor representation of the confidence-accuracy relationship (e.g., Juslin, Olsson, & Winman, 1996; Roediger, Wixted, & DeSoto, 2012). A much better method is calibration analysis, which yields statistics that summarize several aspects of the relation-ship across the entire range of eyewitness identification accuracy and confidence (e.g., Brewer & Wells, 2006; Palmer, Brewer, Weber, & Nagesh, 2013; Sauer, Brewer, Zweck, & Weber, 2010; Weber & Brewer, 2004). Unfortunately, calibration analysis requires a great deal of data per cell of an experimental design (Juslin et al., 1996), which made the ap-proach untenable for the present experiment and our pool of participants. Instead of pursuing calibration analysis, we constructed confidence-accuracy char-acteristic (CAC) curves (Carlson, in press-ab; Mickes, 2015). Mickes (2015) argued that © Applied Psychology in Criminal Justice, 2016, 12(2) CARLSON, ET AL. 95these curves would be most informative for those in the criminal justice system for two reasons. First, they highlight the accuracy of eyewitnesses who report high levels of con-fidence in their lineup decision. After all, these are the eyewitnesses most likely to make it all the way to trial to report this high confidence to a jury. Second, the curves depict only suspect identifications (perpetrator IDs/perpetrator IDs + innocent suspect IDs), which are of greatest importance to the criminal justice system (in contrast to foil identifications or lineup rejections). Figure 2 depicts the CAC curves from the present study. First notice the linear function for the typical object/action condition (stapler used as a stapler). This is a fairly typical function, indicating that eyewitness confidence and accuracy are increasing concur-rently and at roughly the same rate. The other conditions do not yield linear functions, but importantly they all end up in approximately the same space, with the highest confidence representing high accuracy. Those who reported 90-100% confidence were accurate in the range of 86-100%. The curve that stands out belongs to the stapler used as a weapon condi-tion, which is the only condition with a negative relationship between confidence and ac-curacy from low (0-60%) to medium (70-80%) confidence. In addition, those reporting the highest confidence (90-100%) in this condition are actually not much more accurate (86%) than those reporting low confidence (82%). We do not have a ready explanation for this odd pattern, as generally accuracy should increase, not decrease, as confidence increases (for exceptions, see Roediger et al., 2012). But it is interesting that this pattern arose from a condition not previously studied in terms of the CA relationship. We return to this point in the General Discussion. Figure 2. Confidence-Accuracy Characteristic (CAC) curves with standard error bars.© Applied Psychology in Criminal Justice, 2016, 12(2)96 THE WEAPON FOCUS EFFECTWe want to focus on the overall finding across all conditions of high eyewitness identification accuracy at the highest level of confidence. This replicates recent studies ma-nipulating several variables. Mickes (2015) identified a similar pattern in data from Palmer et al. (2013) comparing encoding times of 5 seconds versus 90 seconds. Mickes also rep-licated the pattern across simultaneous and sequential lineups. Carlson et al. (in press-a) found a similar pattern across conditions manipulating weapon presence and concealment. Finally, Carlson and et al. (in press-b) replicated the pattern across manipulations of weap-on presence and how long the perpetrator was visible to participants (3 vs. 10 seconds). If this pattern continues to be replicated across manipulations of additional variables relevant to eyewitness identification, it should have a large influence on the interpretation of eye-witness confidence by those in the criminal justice system. We expand on this issue below. GENERAL DISCUSSIONIn the present experiment, we investigated the possibility that a typical object used in a distinctive manner (i.e., as a weapon) could produce a weapon focus effect (WFE), as is found when weapons or other unexpected objects appear in a scene. This study served a theoretical and an applied purpose. The prominent theoretical explanation of the WFE is that an unusual object will draw eyewitness attention, thereby harming their memory for other aspects of a scene. We extended this unusualness hypothesis to include a typical object used in an unusual manner (i.e., a stapler used as a weapon). In terms of applica-tion, criminals often utilize everyday objects as weapons (e.g., beer bottle, tire iron), and it would be useful for the criminal justice system to know whether or not this type of ob-ject also would yield a WFE. This could impact how police interview eyewitnesses after a crime and whether or not they would present an identification procedure (e.g., lineup, showup). It might be assumed that eyewitness memory would be impacted negatively by the presence of a weapon, but what about a typical object used as a weapon? In addition to addressing this question, we sought to replicate the standard WFE by including a condi-tion with a handgun. We also included a condition with an unusual object (toy) to test the standard unusualness hypothesis.Tests of the Weapon Focus Effect and the Unusualness HypothesisResults supported the standard WFE, such that eyewitness identification accuracy was decreased when our perpetrator was holding the handgun. This decrease in accuracy was driven entirely by an increase in identifications of the innocent suspect, as there were no differences among conditions in perpetrator identifications. This result replicates re-cent research that also utilized perpetrator-present and perpetrator-absent lineups: Three other high-powered experiments have found a larger impact of weapon presence on false identifications than for correct identifications (Carlson & Carlson, 2012, 2014; Erickson et al., 2014). We do not want to speculate as to potential mechanisms behind this replicated phenomenon, but the implications are certainly worth noting. After a crime involving a weapon, a guilty suspect in a lineup might not be much less likely to be chosen, but an in-nocent suspect in a lineup is apparently placed at greater risk. It is also important to note that, though participants had a conservative response bias for suspect identifications across © Applied Psychology in Criminal Justice, 2016, 12(2) CARLSON, ET AL. 97all conditions (i.e., they were not especially likely to choose either the perpetrator or the innocent suspect), they were least conservative for the handgun condition. This implies that eyewitnesses might be more willing to choose a suspect from a lineup after seeing a crime with a weapon. However, signal detection analysis is rarely applied to manipulations of weapon presence to assess effects on response bias, so this effect is in need of replication.As for the unusualness hypothesis, we tested it in two ways (a) with an unusual ob-ject (child’s toy stuffed animal), and (b) with a typical object (stapler) used in an atypical manner (as a weapon to strike a victim over the head). We failed to support both versions of the unusualness hypothesis. Participants were actually most accurate with suspect identifi-cations after seeing the video with the toy, followed by the stapler used as a weapon. Both conditions produced higher accuracy than did the stapler used as a stapler, whereas the unusualness hypothesis predicts that this pattern should be reversed. Though the finding regarding the typical object used as a weapon is contrary to our prediction, it is in agree-ment with the results of the only two other studies to investigate this aspect of the unusual-ness hypothesis. Carlson and Carlson (2012) found no difference between their beer bottle condition and a no weapon condition (i.e., control condition with no object at all) across both perpetrator-present and perpetrator-absent lineups. Kramer et al. (1990) found that a bottle used as a weapon did reduce eyewitness recall compared to no weapon, but they did not support the WFE for eyewitness identification (though as noted earlier, they only used a perpetrator-present lineup, and their correct identifications were no higher than chance). Taking these results as a whole, we conclude that there is no evidence that a typical object used as a weapon will produce a WFE. However, it is still possible that other objects or actions could produce the effect, as so far only two objects have been tested (bottle and sta-pler), and only one action: Striking a victim over the head. Clearly more research is needed on other objects and actions.The result potentially most harmful to the unusualness hypothesis is the lack of a decrement to memory when our perpetrator was seen playing with the child’s toy. This condition fits the standard definition of unusual, such that the object did not belong in that context, in two ways: (a) It did not belong in the home office setting, and (b) the adult perpetrator does not match with the child’s toy. Regardless of this combination of unusu-alness, we did not find evidence that the toy distracted participants, as their memory for the perpetrator was not harmed. However, this could be due to a limitation of the present study: The lack of a memory questionnaire. The WFE is found much more often with a sensitive memory measure like a series of recall and recognition questions about the event, as opposed to a single face recognition test in the form of a lineup (Fawcett et al., 2013). As such, we do not interpret this null result as particularly strong evidence against the unusualness hypothesis. Future studies should include a memory questionnaire as well as perpetrator-present and perpetrator absent lineups in order to more fully evaluate the im-pact of an unusual object on eyewitness memory for a perpetrator and scene.The Confidence-Accuracy RelationshipWe turn now to our confidence-accuracy (CA) findings. Participants in all four con-ditions who indicated high confidence (90-100%) after choosing from a lineup were highly © Applied Psychology in Criminal Justice, 2016, 12(2)98 THE WEAPON FOCUS EFFECTaccurate (ranging from 86-100%). In addition, three of the four conditions showed good resolution, such that identifications backed by high confidence (90-100%) were much more accurate than identifications backed by low confidence (0-60%). The condition with lower resolution was the stapler used as a weapon, as high-confidence identifications were not much more accurate (86%) than low-confidence identifications (82%). Though this finding is in need of replication, it could be interpreted as a harmful influence of viewing a typical object used as a weapon, even though this condition did not lower overall identification accuracy. If such a situation prevents confidence from being a guide concerning accuracy, this would still be problematic to police and the criminal justice system.Only two other studies have investigated the impact of weapon presence on the CA relationship for eyewitness identification. Carlson et al. (in press-a) presented three different versions of a mock crime scenario (purse-snatching): (a) Handgun visible in per-petrator’s hand, (b) handgun concealed in perpetrator’s pocket, and (c) no handgun. They were not interested in testing the unusualness hypothesis, but they did focus on the CA relationship. Their results parallel those of the present study, such that participants who reported high confidence were highly accurate in their lineup identifications, regardless of condition. All of their conditions yielded high resolution, such that low-confidence iden-tifications were much less accurate than high-confidence identifications. Carlson et al. (in press-b) found a similar pattern when manipulating weapon presence, as have other re-searchers when manipulating other eyewitness identification variables, such as time avail-able to encode the perpetrator (Palmer et al., 2013) and simultaneous versus sequential lineups (Mickes, 2015). Conclusions and ImplicationsThe implications of these results can be divided into two categories: (a) The effect of a weapon on eyewitness identification accuracy, and (b) the effect on the confidence-accuracy relationship. First, we replicated the weapon focus effect on eyewitness identifi-cation, which could be interpreted to mean that police should be wary about allowing an eyewitness to see a lineup if the perpetrator had an obvious weapon. After all, the evidence across several studies now indicates that the eyewitness could have relatively poor memory for the perpetrator’s face, so why bother with a lineup? The answer comes from our confi-dence-accuracy curves. The most important recommendation to police based on the present study is to collect confidence immediately after an eyewitness’s lineup decision. Evidence is mounting that identifications supported by high confidence (90-100%) are very likely to be correct, at least under fairly controlled laboratory conditions. This pattern holds true across several manipulations that affect eyewitness accuracy, such as time to encode the perpetrator (Palmer et al., 2013), weapon presence (present study; Carlson et al., in press-ab), and lineup presentation method (Mickes, 2015). Future research should extend this pattern to other relevant eyewitness variables (e.g., distance between eyewitness and per-petrator; retention interval between crime and identification; other lineup manipulations). If this strong link between high confidence and high accuracy continues to be replicated in the lab, it should then be tested in more real world situations to determine its true applica-bility for the criminal justice system. © Applied Psychology in Criminal Justice, 2016, 12(2) CARLSON, ET AL. 99REFERENCESAntes, J.

Relying primarily on data from the incident-based Monterey WMD Database, it employs multinomial logit regression with C, B, R, or N as a categorical dependent variable: a first within the relevant econometric literature. Fundamentally, the study tests the widely-held—although empirically unsubstantiated—technological deterministic assumption that the more readily CBRN technology, materials, and knowledge are accessible to terrorists, the more likely terrorists will be to use unconventional weapons of the corresponding kind: a relationship hypothesized to be stronger for serious attack perpetrators than for hoaxers. Next, the study tests the notion of a continuum of proliferation potential, hypothesizing that as states’ regulatory capacity increases, biological terrorism will be most likely and nuclear terrorism will be least likely. Finally, the study assesses variables that have previously been proven as significant determinants of CBRN over conventional terrorism, to provide the groundwork for future evaluation of the extent to which terrorists may be induced to pursue C, B, R, or N over conventional weapons.Cette étude explore les facteurs, en supposant qu'un terroriste ait franchi le seuil des armes traditionnelles en utilisant des armes non traditionnelles comme les armes chimiques, biologiques, radiologiques et nucléaires (CBRN), qui détermineront la possibilité qu'il/elle choisisse d'utiliser les armes C, B, R ou N.

In contrast, earlier studies have supported Johan Kamminga\u27s conclusion that, on the balance of evidence, Australian microliths were  primarily the penetrating or lacerating elements of composite spears  (Kamminga 1980: 11).

Hafted hunting technology represents the development of new cognitive and social learning mechanisms within the genus Homo , and may have provided a foraging advantage over simpler forms of hunting technology, such as a sharpened wooden spear. However, the nature of this foraging advantage has not been confirmed. Experimental studies and ethnographic reports provide conflicting results regarding the relative importance of the functional, economic, and social roles of hafted hunting technology. The controlled experiment reported here was designed to test the functional hypothesis for stone-tipped weapons using spears and ballistics gelatin. It differs from previous investigations of this type because it includes a quantitative analysis of wound track profiles and focuses specifically on hand-delivered spear technology. Our results do not support the hypothesis that tipped spears penetrate deeper than untipped spears. However, tipped spears create a significantly larger inner wound cavity that widens distally. This inner wound cavity is analogous to the permanent wound cavity in ballistics research, which is considered the key variable affecting the relative ‘stopping power’ or ‘killing power’ of a penetrating weapon. Tipped spears conferred a functional advantage to Middle Pleistocene hominins, potentially affecting the frequency and regularity of hunting success with important implications for human adaptation and life history",,Journal Article,"Paleoanthropology, Gelatin, Weapons, Pleistocene epoch, Ballistics, Human evolution, Archaeology, Antlers",,'Public Library of Science (PLoS)'

Methods: Data were derived from a population-based sample of male (N = 224) and female (N = 244) adolescents followed from grade 10 (M age = 15.5) to grade 11 (M age = 16.5). Peer networks were derived from best friend nominations. Self-reports were used to assess weapon carrying. Aggression and victimization were assessed using both self- and peer-reports. Use of dynamic social network modeling (SIENA) allowed prediction of weapon carrying in grade 11 as a function of weapon carrying of befriended peers, aggression, and victimization in grade 10, while selection processes and structural network effects (reciprocity and transitivity) were controlled for. Results: Peer influence processes accounted for changes in weapon carrying over time. Self-reported victimization decreased weapon carrying 1 year later. Peer-reported victimization increased the likelihood of weapon carrying, particularly for highly aggressive adolescents. Boys were more likely to carry weapons than girls, but the processes associated with weapon carrying did not differ for boys and girls. Conclusions: These findings revealed that, in this population-based sample, weapon carrying of best friends, as well as aggression, contributed to the proliferation of weapons in friendship networks, suggesting processes of peer contagion as well as individual vulnerability to weapon carrying.6 p",,Article / Letter to editor,Social Development,,'Elsevier BV'

Sam LowderFirst Year Writing HonorsProfessor Duneer15 November 2020Perpetual WeaponsTommy Orange’s There There is riddled with motifs that connect characters in more than just a literal, social sense.  When multiple characters are shown studying their reflections, for example, the reader realizes they share something on a deeper level, that no matter how different these peoples’ lives are, they all experience some of the same subconscious motivations. Further, an element of the story that ties not only the characters together, but the entire Native American community, is gun violence.  Throughout the entirety of his novel There There, Tommy Orange uses gun violence, specifically bullets, as a timeless symbol of corruption and hate in Native American communities; a theme that can be easily reflected in general American culture as an ever growing epidemic.Orange opens his book with a briefing on the genocide of Native Americans, explaining the brutal ways in which his anscestors were killed. One focus of this prologue is the introduction of firearms to America.  What used to be a peaceful country, not yet industrialized, was invaded by foreign technology, giving the Natives no chance to defend themselves.  “The bullets were premonitions, ghosts from dreams of a hard, fast future”; they “became the promise of what was to come, the speed and the killing, the hard, fast lines of borders and buildings”(Orange 10).  When Native communities were attacked by colonists with guns, it was the end of an era; nothing would ever be the same again.  The arrival of these bullets signified the beginning of industrialization, the execution of not only Native Americans, but of pure natureLowder 2and wildlife.  This tragedy is later demonstrated in the “conversation” depicted between Opal and her teddy bear, Two Shoes.  Two Shoes explains that white men have violently killed Native Americans and bears alike upon infiltrating their home with weapons: “sister, they slit all our throats,” he professes (Orange 51).Later on, the story’s interlude directly foreshadows the book’s ending by discussing ashooting that takes place at a powwow.  Orange writes that “a bullet is a thing so fast it’s hot andso hot it’s mean and so straight it moves clean through a body, makes a hole, tears, burns, exits,goes on, hungry, or it remains, cools, lodges, positions” (141).  Orange personifies these bulletsas if they have evil minds of their own, as if they are determined to thrust pain and suffering ontoanyone nearby.  These bullets are reckless machines without morals, they do not discriminateagainst children or the innocent, they just keep going. Therefore, it is implied that those whooperate guns, those who set these bullets free, are just as cruel and heartless as the senselesspieces of metal.  Additionally, as a possible reference back to the prologue, it is mentioned that“the bullets have been coming from miles. Years” (Orange 141).  Metaphorically,  these bulletscausing havoc at the modern powwow are the same ones that the colonists brought into thecountry centuries ago; they have one purpose and one purpose only: to kill mercilessly.Finally, the powwow Orange’s characters attend, the event earlier hinted at in theinterlude, acts as the finale of There There; it is what completely merges not only the characters’lives with one another, but the more informational segments of the novel with the plotline.  Thefirst “Big Oakland Powwow” was meant to symbolize that Native American culture still exists,that the characters are “a present tense people, modern, relevant, [and] alive,” yet, it abruptlyconcludes with its celebrants lying dead “in the grass [while] wearing feathers” (Orange 141).The only difference between this present day occurrence and the historical arrival of white menLowder 3to America is that at the powwow, a group of Native Americans were the ones to sabotage theirown culture.  The way in which this group of characters have adopted the violent role of thewhite colonists could easily be a reference to assimilation: a theme directly related to guns in theway that both have oppressed the Native American culture. Possibly, the most descriptive scenein this shooting is the final chapter in which the book’s focus shifts full circle, back to TonyLoneman.  Without a doubt, Tony’s body receives more bullets than anyone else’s as he strugglesto run towards Charles.  In a way parallel to the book’s very first description of mechanicalmassacre, Orange writes that “the bullet feels fast and hot in [Tony’s] leg even though he knowsthe bullet can’t be moving anymore” (286).  This repetition of describing the high speed andtemperature of the bullets throughout the entirety of the book solidifies the idea that nothing haschanged; even “assimilated,” “urban” Indians must face the same violence their ancestors oncedid.  Further, much like the personification of the bullets in the interlude, Tony feels “the hotheavy weight and speed of the bullets do[ing] their best to push him back, pull him down,”proving once again that Tommy Orange has the intent of making these weapons just asantagonistic as the people operating them (Orange 287).  These constant parallelisms, connectingthe events of the past to those of the present, symbolically illustrate that although timeprogresses, violence doesn’t end.  In fact, this specific element of Orange’s storytelling can bemirrored in the seemingly immortal second amendment of the United States Constitution.Even though it has been hundreds of years since the creation of the second amendment,the right to bear arms, the American government has not attempted to alter it, despite the fact thatguns are becoming increasingly more dangerous and deadly than they previously were in moreprimitive times.  As a matter of fact, this amendment was only created because “the men writingthe Bill of Rights wanted every citizen to be in the militia, and they wanted everyone in theLowder 4militia to be armed” (Shusterman).  The reasoning involved in the birth of this amendment wasbased on the fact that the United States did not have, or want, a professional full-time army ofsoldiers.  Additionally, “if someone was prohibited from participating in the militia, the leadersof the Founders’ generation would not have wanted them to have access to weapons”(Shusterman).  Presently, America actually has its own army full of voluntary soldiers, making itso that everyone does not have an obligation to physically get up and fight for the country atrandom, thus, rendering the second amendment irrelevant when considering its original purpose.If American citizens were to abide by the original intentions of this law, they would not be ableto own guns unless they took part in the U.S. army. But, of course, “as with all thingsconstitutional, Americans are adapting 18th-century laws to fit 21st-century lives” (Shusterman).The fact that the second amendment has not been altered since 1776 is quite shocking asmechanical weapons, just as any other technology, have been developed in ways that have made them more effective than ever before.  Unlike other machines, such as cars, guns last for an incredibly long time.  As Dr. Richard F. Corlin explains in a speech on the topic, many people already have old guns that work as any gun should, so in order to keep the industry running, manufacturers must create new and improved weapons at every chance they get.“These changes make guns better suited for crime, because they are easier to carry and more likely to kill or maim whether they are used intentionally or unintentionally” (Corlin).  Sadly, largely because of America’s refusal to set down its guns, shootings like the one in There There happen all too often.  Even worse is the fact that many of these tragedies could have been prevented with stricter gun laws.  For example, the United Kingdom managed to ban the possession of all handguns after one single school shooting in Scotland (Cooke).  Meanwhile, the U.S. government has yet to take any drastic action on the subject after years of mass shootings.Lowder 5As a matter of fact, the number of guns in the United States has only ever grown over time; as of2018, there are 120.5 guns per one hundred people living in America, which is more than doublethe amount in Yemen, the country holding the second-highest ratio of guns per hundred people:52.8 (BBC).  As of 2017, guns take part in 73 percent of all American homicides, while in thestricter United Kingdom, they take part in only three percent (BBC).  A statistic like this goes toshow that limiting the public’s access to guns actually does bring the majority of gun violence toa halt; even though some criminals may still have access to guns after a ban, it does more goodthan harm when looking at the big picture.With so much evidence in favor of stricter gun laws, one might think that more peoplewould stop glorifying the outdated second amendment, but this simply isn’t the case.  One reasonas to why this might be so is America’s fixation on threats unrelated to what hides within thecountry.  Ever since 9/11, terrorism has been viewed as one of the most lethal threats toAmerican citizens, when, in actuality, “nearly as many Americans will die [in any given month]from gun violence than died on 9/11” (Cohen).  For comparison, in the aftermath of 9/11, “theUnited States invaded two nations, spent trillions of dollars and reoriented the federalgovernment's national security footing toward the fight against terrorism,” yet, following yearsof gun violence, there may be discussion of togetherness and change, but no legal action beyondthe basic arrest of the offender is taken (Cohen). Undoubtedly, 9/11 was a horrible tragedy, butso was the Sandy Hook shooting, in which over 20 children were killed, so was the Las Vegasshooting, in which 58 people were massacred, and so was the Pulse Nightclub shooting, in which49 members of the LGBTQ community were targeted and murdered out of hate, to name only afew incidents (BBC).  Acts of terrorism from overseas and acts of terrorism from within theLowder 6United States itself bear the same dreadful results, so why won’t the government react in thesame logical way?One possible factor that may greatly contribute to the longevity of America’santi-gun-control attitude is that for many pro-gun citizens, the right to bear arms representspatriotism and freedom; they become defensive if they feel this element of their freedom is beingthreatened.  Yet, on the other hand, this idea of guns equaling “freedom” may be a cover up formen who experience thoughts of a more vulnerable nature. Psychoanalytical research suggeststhat one “motivation for the acquisition of guns as personal possessions has been attributed tofeelings of insecurity or to the need for a sense of control, mastery, or power” (Cooke).  In otherwords, unconfident men often feel as if possessing a gun grants them more masculinity,something valued greatly amongst males in American culture.  After decades of misogyny, menare afraid to be perceived as even slightly feminine, so they often go to great lengths and act inextreme ways as a means to be perceived by society as strong, powerful, and manly.  Thus, “theintroduction of regulatory gun control” “diminish[es], even threaten[s],” this “particular image offunctional masculinity” (Cooke).  Overall, for those who feel as if their life is out of their control,guns make them feel as if they have more power over their destiny.In relation to There There, could this yearning for control have been one of the factors thatdrove the group of robbers, Octavio in particular, toward gun violence?  After a brutal childhoodand the tragic death of his mother and brother in a car accident, Octavio must have felt defeated,as if he could do nothing to change his fate.  Growing up, he was exposed to a great amount ofviolence - often hiding from people with guns and other weapons - so it was most likely secondnature for him to view guns as tools that could get him what he wanted: money, and therefore,happiness.  Tommy Orange illustrates this idea in not only Octavio’s obsession with guns, butLowder 7also when describing his simplest actions.  Before using a literal gun to force Calvin to assist himin the robbery, “his eyes turned into bullets--he shot them around the room” (Orange 93).Octavio is ultimately a product of what his ancestors’ massacrists brought to the United States;the violence he faced all his life has transformed him into someone who needs guns to act.  It’sironic that Octavio somewhat represents the very weapons used to kill his forefathers, but evenmore ironically, Octavio is shot to death by the guns he himself 3D printed.  As a side note, thismetaphorical suicide even further elaborates on the United States’ gun issues, as approximatelysixty percent of gun deaths are accounted for by suicide (BBC).  Ultimately, Octavio is yetanother Native American casualty of the white man’s invasion of America.Although There There has many depressing undertones, Orange leaves many elements of his novel open-ended and somewhat filled with hope. One moment such as this takes place in the waiting room of the hospital after the powwow shooting, focusing on Opal, whose grandson, Orvil, had just been wounded.  The first line of this chapter is “Opal knows Orvil’s gonna make it,” and although it is followed by some doubt, Opal’s final appearance in the novel comes full circle when the doctor emerges from the hospital (284). It was previously mentioned that Opal has “good” and “bad” numbers, so when she counts the amount of times the door swings and it ends on number eight, a “good” number, the reader knows positive news must follow.  The reader is given the power to decide for themselves what happens to Orvil, as well as many of the other characters; the audience has the ability to change the outcome depending on their interpretation.  Similarly, America as a whole has the ability to change its own future, to prevent innocent children like Orvil from being killed, whether it be at a powwow or a more common battleground such as school.  In the same way that some of Orange’s characters were killed,Lowder 8many American citizens have already suffered from gun violence, but just as Orvil’s fate lies inthe reader’s hands, the fate of the United States lies in the hands of its subjects; there is still hope.Lowder 9Cohen, Michael A., “America’s Biggest National Security Threats Are At Home, Not Abroad.”World Politics Review (Selective Content).

novel weapons hypothesis,481156016,The swords of Damocles : explaining unconventional weapon non-use in modern war,,"Claar, Martin",2017,"Advisors: Andrea Radasanu.Committee members: Scot Schraufnagel; S. Adam Seagrave; Ches Thurber.Includes bibliographical references.This dissertation investigates the logic for unconventional weapon non-use during wars in the 20th Century. International relations scholarship has offered two primary explanatory factors for the non-use of radiological, biological and chemical weapons: either it is a result of power concerns and utility or due to adherence to taboo norms. However, these logics are insufficient in explaining oscillations in policy, near misses and instances of actual use. Thus, I argue that normative concerns based on the rules of war as associated with Just War theory impact the decisions concerning unconventional weapons. Consideration of the discriminatory and proportionality norms associated with Just War theory best reflect why states with opportunity and motive would abstain from use, while instances of supreme emergency would explain a state's use policies or narrow misses. To test this explanation, a series of case studies will examined involving the only state to ever use both chemical and nuclear weapons---the United States. Using primary decision-making documents, supplemented with secondary historical sources, the motivation for U.S. policies should be apparent. Afterward, considerations of applicability to other cases or new weapons technology will be considered.Ph.D. (Doctor of Philosophy",,"Text, Dissertation/Thesis","Political science, International relations, Philosophy, Armed Forces--Study and teaching",,Northern Illinois University
novel weapons hypothesis,214613174,How Rebellious Non-State-Actors acquire weapons,,"Zohar, Eran",2015,"Recent events in world politics, such as the civil wars in Syria and Iraq and conflicts between powerful rebel groups and weak governments in Africa, underline the need for a comprehensive theory to explain how Non States Actors (NSAs) acquire weapons and the factors that influence these efforts. Rebellious activity has been an integral part of political life since ancient times and has taken diverse forms. There were always those who revolted and took up arms against central rule. Weapons were not necessarily the most important factor but rebels needed weapons to fight and usually revolts erupted after the organizers acquired some weapons while many revolts lost their momentum, and operations were not carried out or effective due to shortages in arms and ammunition. Conflicts between governments and armed NSAs have always outnumbered inter-state wars and are not a new phenomenon as some scholars claim. In the last decade NSAs have accelerated the acquisition of large sophisticated weapons systems. They could be better armed than states’ armies because of their access to advanced technologies in the possession of supporting countries or international arms markets. Other NSAs, lacking external support, employ Mao’s principle of self-reliance. They live on their enemies’ arms stocks and improvised weaponry.  Available literature on armed NSAs is incomplete because it addresses partial aspects of the problem. This thesis is an attempt to construct a substantive theory explaining NSAs’ arming, offering generic phases and principles that characterize past and present NSAs and probably the NSAs of the near future. The thesis also checks how globalization has affected the way rebellious NSAs acquire arms. In spite of dramatic political and technological changes, rebel groups in different periods have employed similar methods to acquire weapons. Self-production, looting and stealing, external support and arms trade were always the major methods for NSAs to acquire armaments, though the importance of each method and the type of arms changed remarkably over time. Persistent principles have shaped the arming of NSAs. Initial engagements between rebels and states usually highlighted the superior force of the latter, but because of states’ interests and constraints weapons and military technology have been leaking from states to NSAs by different methods.  A set of factors, political, social, cultural, technological and organizational, both facilitated and constrained NSAs’ ability to practise the four methods of arming, making it a dynamic  process. From the nineteenth century, NSAs have employed mainly external sources to acquire weapons rather than domestic sources because the technology of modern weapons is more difficult to improvise. Another dramatic development, dating from the second half of the twentieth century, is the intensive use of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) by armed NSAs, enabling them to reduce the power imbalance against the state. Present NSAs can easily acquire and ship weapons systems over long distances using the mechanisms of globalization. They are customers of the global illicit arms trade that integrates government and non-government actors, creating complicated structures, often beyond the control of national states. Still, arms smuggling remains a time-place-based challenge for NSAs, while governments improve their counter-smuggling skills. In the near future NSAs’ efforts to obtain weapons will dominate their conflicts against states.

If biases of visual attention for weapons result from selection pressures related to these activities, then we would predict such biases to be stronger in men than in women. The current study reports the results of two visual search experiments, in which men showed a stronger bias of attention toward guns and knives than did women, whether the weapons were depicted wielded or not. When the weapons were depicted wielded, both sexes searched for them with more caution than when they were not. Neither of these effects extended reliably to syringes, a non-weapon—yet potentially threatening—object.

While the thinkers of Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) count on light ground forces to serve in concert with air power, the air superiority needed might not always be available. To determine possible outcomes of clashes between light and heavy forces, the paper examines seven historical case studies of clashes between opponents with great armament disparity, looking for importance of armament disparity inside the cases, as well as comparing them between the cases. The set of case studies largely confirmed the hypothesis, proving the value of heavy ground forces in combat. However, it also found that other effects, primarily air support and use of terrain, can mitigate or completely counter the effect of armament disparity.

He argues that new arms control measures are needed to promote greater transparency about the development of these weapons.  Key findings    	The United States, Russia, and China are modernising their nuclear forces. Advances in technology mean that tactical nuclear weapons are becoming more sophisticated and increasingly precise. This raises the possibility that these weapons will also become more usable. 	Technological change is also being accompanied by changes in doctrine. In particular, area-denial capabilities as well as credible ballistic missile defence systems are encouraging some nuclear powers to contemplate the use of limited tactical nuclear weapon strikes in conventional war fighting. 	Tactical nuclear weapons remain among the least transparent elements of the nuclear arsenals of the major powers. This increases the risk that modernisation programs may promote a new arms race and harm strategic stability.

This thesis hypothesizes that there is a third option in which nuclear deterrence can be held by a collective versus a single nation-state, which can then engender trust and increase security. The methods used to prove this hypothesis are based on evaluating multiple scenarios of both acquisition and use, and evaluating how institutionalized nuclear weapons would work under each of these scenarios.

Sigma XI (Directorate of Technical Development Army Haquarters) There is little doubt that explosives had their origin in warfare. In  the armed conflict between groups of individuals or of states, where each sought and still seeks to impose its will upon the ot.her by force, it was inevitable that arms should grow and flourish. The sling, the bow and arrow, the sword and firearm typify evolution in warfare weapons. Bs a means of propelling missiles, the gun and gun powder were thought of. The history of explosives, therefore, may be said to begin with black powder. E'rom the voluminous and conflicting evidence before us, it is almost difficult to trace the black powder back to its origin. According to Halhead (1776) gunpowder has been known in India ' far teyond ,all periods of in- vestigation '. Tho other claimants are the Chinese, Greeks, ,4rabs, English and the Cemmns. With the great strides made by science from the fifties of the last century, progress in explosives also kept pace. .The discovery .of nitroglycerine in 1846 by Sobrero opened up new possibilities. This invention of nitroglycerine, however, remained undeveloped for a long time, excepting for minor use as a remedy for headache in diluted alcoholic solution under the name of glonoine. It is to the genius of Alfred Nobel (1833-96) that we owe the genesis, and development of explosives based on nitroglycerine. From 1859 onwards, Alfred and his father Emmanuel Nobel. busied themselves with experiments on N. G. Eventually in 1862 they erected a t  Eieleneborg, near Stockholm, a s m l l  plant where nitroglycerine was manufactured in small quantities. In the two years following, Nobel's efforts were mainly directed towards the introduction of his explosive, called the ' blasting oil ', into blasting practice. When these were beginning to look bright, the young manufacturer met with a severe reverse. In  1864 there was a terrific explosion at the plant, resulting in its complete destruction. Alfrbd's young brother Oscar Emil was killed in the explosion, while his father Emmanual Nobel was severely injured from which he never recoveretl, dying in 1872. The accident nude a deep impression upon the public and consequently cansed the Government to forbid the manufacture of nitroglycerine. But Alfred was undaunted, . . . . . . ' strong in will '. Alfred Nobel rented a boat and anchored i t  at Malrsee and continued his experiments, removed from dwellings, till he was rewarded icith the discovery of dynamite, although once again t,hrough an act of ' sependiarism '. The sheet metal cans containing nitroglycerine were packed in Kieselgnrh in order to protect them from shock and damage during transportation. When unpacking the cans, i t  was found that one of them had apparently lost a portion of its oil, an?l in this way Nobel discovered the absorbing capacity of Kiesel- gurh for Pr'. G. The capilliary action of the minute diatomaceous particles of the kieselgurh converts nitroglycerine into a cheesy, plastic mass, which hardly shows any exudatioq qnd is much more insensitive to shock tbau free N. G ,  26 DEFENCE SCIENCE JOURNAL 27 However, neither the freezing of I?. G., nor its absorption by kieselgurh made it entirely safe or efficient. It was soon discovered for instance, that N. G .  in dynamite could be displaced by water and therefore dynamite would be of little use for demolition purposes in water or in wet holes. Improve- ment over dynamite had to be erected, if N. G .  was to be used for blasting purposes. Nobel was revolving these problems in his mind, when chance again favoured him. It was a chance that only an active and alert mind could seize upon and utilise for the benefit of mankind. '4 small wound on Nobel was dressed with collodion. This gave him the idea of colloidising or gelatinising nitroglycerine with nitrocf;llulose. Thus arose blasting gelatine that was to be the premier demolition explosive of the world to-day. Its performance was efficient and perfect, as witnessed by the number of factories Nobel established in most countries on the Continent and in .Imerica for the manufacture of blasting gelatine. 'FIe thereby amass4 a big fortune most of which he bequeathed, as we all know, to  a trust for the establishment of five prizes, one of which is to be given to a person or society that renders p a t e s t  service to the cause of international brotherhood, in the supression or reduction of standing armies, or in the establishment or furtherance of peace Congress. We might. pause here for a while, contemplating this great genius and his munificent contributions towards promotion of universal brotherhood. NO less fascinating than the history of nitroglycerine is the history of nitrocellulose which begins in the gear 1833, When Bracannot first prepared nitrostamh under the name of xyloidine. In 1538, Pelouze found that xyloidine ignites a t  1803C, and burns with a very considerable violence. Paper treated with nitric acid was found to have similar combustible properties and Felouze believed that these properties might make such materials useful in artillery. ID 1845 Schonbein prepared for the first time Schiessbaumwalle i.e., guncotton from absorbent cotton. ?here is an amusing story on the discovery of guncotton by Schonbein. I t  appears that; Schonbein, like many other inventors, often used his wife's kitchen for his experiments. One day he was distilling nitric acid and sulphuric acid or! the kitchen stove, when the flask broke. He grabbed the neareat. thing, his wife's apron, which seemed none the worse for the treatment and hung it up to dry in front of the kitchen fire. Suddenly there was a pul? and the apron went up in flames. Being a true Scientist, although perhaps a cowardly husband, he repeated the experi- ment and.discovered that the treatment of cotton with a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids resulted in a highly inflammable compound but possessing the same physical appearance of the original cotton. _ Gunpowder, as already mentioned, was the propellant sine quo non till the rise of smokeloss powder, when it completely went out of the field. In considering development of modern propellank a e  have to refer to Robel's work again. In extension of his experiments on blasting gelatin% i.e., of gelatinising nitroglycerine with nitrocellulose, he increased the nitro- cellulose content and thus succeeded in producing a fairly horn-like colloid which co~lld no longer be detonated by a blasting cap, but proved to be a very suitable and powerful propellant on account of its slow combustion. After prolonged and inteneive research, he fixed upon 40% nitroglycerine and 60% nitrocellulose (part of it guncotton) as the most suitable composition and called it ballistite (1888). This discovery was the most outstanding of the time in the sense that $wo of the most brisant and sensitive of the explosives in their free state, from being bad masters became good servants in the cause of mankind. Almost simultaneously, Abel acd Dewar discovered that nitroglycerine and guncotton could be better plasticised with the use of acetone. The dough, thus obtained, they caused to be pressed out into sticks or cords, known there- after as cordite. The first of tohis series i s  cordite Mk. 1, introduced by the British Government. In the South African War, it first came to notice that cardite Mk. 1 was highly eroding to the gun barrels, which was traced to the excessive heat produced by the large amount of nitroglycerine (88%) in the cordite. A modification, under the name cordite M. D., with added mineral jelly and nitroglycerine reduced to 30%, was found to overcome the defect and became so popular with the British Services that the largest industrial venture of the 1914-18 War in Grest Britain was the (Propellant) faetory a t  Gretna, its acid- prod-acing capacity exceeding that of the whole country before the war. To improve further upon cordite M.D. the War Office and the Admiralty, after the first Great War, initiated researches into producing a propellant that would be free from flash and smoke. These researches resulted in cordite which contains oarbamite as stabiliser, in place of mineral jelly of the M. D. cordite. Cordite W is superior to cordite M. D. in stability. The Navy uses cordite S.C.,-no solvenfs are used in its manufacture. In recent times further improvements have been effected, and we have now a great variety of cordites such as, cordite, TV.B1., A, N, hW, I,, NQ, etc., and are available in different sizes and shapes. In U.S.A., on the other hand, nitrocellulose powders in different forms, suitably stabilised, are the standard propellants. Thus N.C.T. is nitrocellulose tubular stabilized with diphenylamine, while the Dupont powder is nitrocellulose coated with dinitrotoluene and graphite. These powders do not contain nitroglycerine. The nitrocellulose powders are generally hygroscopic, causing variation in ballistics and are not so stable in storage as cordite ; they are rather bulky and burn more slowly and more uniformly than cordite and cause less erosion.

novel weapons hypothesis,74226722,Weapon of choice: small arms and the culture of military innovation,,"Ford, Matthew",2017,"This book examines Western military technological innovation through the lens of developments in small arms during the twentieth century. These weapons have existed for centuries, appear to have matured only incrementally and might seem unlikely technologies for investigating the trajectory of military–technical change. Their relative simplicity, however, makes it easy to use them to map patterns of innovation within the military–industrial complex. Advanced technologies may have captured the military imagination, offering the possibility of clean and decisive outcomes, but it is the low technologies of the infantryman that can help us develop an appreciation for the dynamics of military–technical change.    Tracing the path of innovation from battlefield to back office, and from industry to alliance partner, Ford develops insights into the way that small arms are socially constructed. He thereby exposes the mechanics of power across the military–industrial complex. This in turn reveals that shifting power relations between soldiers and scientists, bureaucrats and engineers, have allowed the private sector to exploit infantry status anxiety and shape soldier weapon preferences. Ford’s analysis allows us to draw wider conclusions about how military innovation works and what social factors frame Western military purchasing policy, from small arms to more sophisticated and expensive weapons",,,,,Hurst & Co Ltd

In contrast, when there is symmetry and both states possess nuclear weapons, then the odds of war precipitously drop.

The most prominentmanifestation of its “revolutionary” character is the fact that airpower pro-vides commanders with a relatively easy method of penetrating physically theenemy’s defensive system and delivering firepower—in abstract terms, of con-ducting power projection.1Wei: Research & DebatePublished by U.S. Naval War College Digital Commons, 20081 3 4 N A V A L W A R C O L L E G E R E V I E WAs aviation (and space) weaponry of all kinds developed, air-defense systemsevolved as well, from “barrage balloons” to surface-to-air missiles, from pointair defense to area air defense, all the way up to today’s out-of-area interceptiontechnology. From a historical perspective, and in terms of the interaction be-tween offensive and defensive systems, changes in “delivery methods” of fire-power can be understood as simply the continuous evolution of thecost-effectiveness ratio. During World War II, vast numbers of bombers, “FlyingFortresses,” covered the sky over strategic nodes of the Axis powers. During theKorean War, bombers confronted newly developed jet-propelled interceptor air-craft, and the high cost-effectiveness of this mode of delivery became difficult tosustain. Until the Vietnam War, the United States possessed absolute air superi-ority; then, however, facing surface-to-air missiles, it often exchanged the mis-sions of tactical aircraft and heavy bombers, employing F-105 fighter-bombersto attack targets deep within enemy territory while relying on B-52 strategicbombers for support missions on the battlefield and against forward positions.During the Persian Gulf War, coalition strikes against deep targets were all un-dertaken by tactical aircraft—for example, by the F-117A stealth fighter, whichcarries only two laser-guided bombs. It is important to note that since the Ko-rean War, the majority of wars involving great powers like the United States havebeen of medium or low intensity, so their combat systems have been used in rela-tively benign environments.Cruise missiles and ballistic missiles, both of which appeared in the finalstage of World War II, possess even stronger capabilities than existing types oftactical aircraft for penetration of the enemy’s defensive space, and at an evenbetter cost-effectiveness ratio. Ballistic missiles, given the same tactical param-eters, offer more outstanding penetration capability and cost-effectivenessthan cruise missiles.One of the reasons that numerous third-world countries favor tactical ballis-tic missiles is that because of their limitations, they are generally at a significantdisadvantage in confrontations with great powers. Under such circumstances,how to guarantee penetration of the enemy’s defense space is the first problem tobe solved. By means of ballistic missiles, an actor inferior in combat aircraftcan deliver firepower against a dominant actor. From the economic point ofview, developing an effective air force is very complex and requires a long ges-tation period. A substantial deterrent using tactical ballistic missiles takes farfewer resources; it is a “short-term investment” that can produce instant re-sults. The effect is similar to that of crossbows against knights in medieval Eu-rope—and today, as with the “Law Forbidding Crossbows,” developed Westerncountries impose tight restrictions on tactical missiles and related technology.2Naval War College Review, Vol. 61 [2008], No. 3, Art. 8https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/nwc-review/vol61/iss3/8W A N G W E I 1 3 5TACTICAL BALLISTIC MISSILES UNDER THE DOCTRINE OFLAND-BASED SEA CONTROLSimply put, the emergence of tactical ballistic missiles (TBMs) has enabledweaker parties to offset to a certain extent the effectiveness of the expensive aircombat systems of stronger opponents at a relatively low cost. However, theTBM alone cannot fundamentally change the superior and inferior positions ofthe two sides. During the Persian Gulf War, coalition air forces flew more than112,000 sorties, dropping 225,500 bombs; during the Kosovo war, NATO forcesflew thirty-five thousand sorties and dropped twenty-five thousand bombs;during the war in Afghanistan, U.S., British, and other allied forces dropped a to-tal of about 17,400 bombs. From the perspective of the cost-effectiveness ratio, itis hard to imagine that TBMs could deliver firepower on the same scale. But theweapon often makes a significant difference for the weak forces of a small coun-try against the integrated combat systems of a great power.At the tactical level, the value of medium- and short-range TBMs—presentlyone of China’s principal means of delivering long-range firepower—lies in theirability to penetrate enemy defense systems without placing high demands on thetactical environment. When we broaden our discussion to encompass the strate-gic level, however, the value of tactical missiles must be restated in this way: theyprovide China with more maneuvering space for military and political strategicoperations on its eastern, maritime flank.First, let us examine the Taiwan Strait. At the most comprehensive level,China’s Taiwan strategy is at present one of building up reserves rather thanpreparation. The core of this effort consists in strategic resource accumulationand geopolitical positioning. The specific goals are to avoid a situation in whichthe Taiwanese authorities go too far toward independence and to curtail gradu-ally their political room for maneuver, thus laying the foundation for futureunification.To maintain the current trend of stability in the strait area, it is necessary forthe central government to maintain a certain amount of military pressureagainst separatist forces, in addition to various political and diplomatic mea-sures, to deter behavior that “crosses the line or oversteps the boundary.” Thus,TBMs offer the mainland strategy toward Taiwan a third option, aside fromall-out use of force or reliance on nonmilitary means. That third choice, “attack-ing without entering,” represents a critical military way of exerting pressure onTaiwan. It creates greater decision-making space for the mainland with respectto Taiwan, while compressing the available space for the Taiwanese regime andgreatly reducing its options. Put more concretely, ballistic missiles provide thetools by which a “quasi-war” scenario can be made feasible. First, the tacticalmissile’s strong penetration capability can guarantee a high probability of3Wei: Research & DebatePublished by U.S. Naval War College Digital Commons, 2008success without a large-scale, high-intensity attack on the island itself, evenagainst a fairly intact air-defense system. After all, the effectiveness gap betweenmissile and antimissile technologies is much greater than that between aircraftand air-defense technologies. With respect to long-range firepower, the twosides of the Taiwan Strait are simply not comparable; the mainland occupies anabsolute and asymmetrically dominant position. Moreover, missiles essentiallypreclude engagements between personnel, thus giving the mainland control ofmilitary action as well as of corresponding political effects. An additional effectcomes into play on the political level. Over a long period of time, deployment ofmedium- and short-range TBMs along the mainland coast has had a significantpsychological impact on the Taiwanese public. Variations in the number of mis-siles deployed have become an indirect means of exerting influence upon the is-land’s internal political situation.In the longer term, should the mainland have no alternative but the use offorce in order to recover Taiwan, it will not be possible to neglect the possibilityof intervention by foreign militaries. Therefore, it will be necessary to undertakestrategic deployments in advance, in order to minimize the likelihood as well asthe intensity of any such intervention.Unlike tactical aircraft, cruise missiles, or other such delivery platforms, bal-listic missiles cannot be intercepted by the enemy’s air force. For an island na-tion, such as Japan, the most practical method to increase the depth of defensivespace is deploying sea-based missile interceptor systems in coastal waters.Against the threat of medium-range ballistic missiles from the Chinese main-land, however, what is needed is not a few “Aegis” air-defense ships but a com-plete naval combat system—just as China has developed a complete attacksystem. The maneuver and deployment of tactical missiles on home territorycauses China few military or political problems, whereas, in addition to their re-taliatory value, they pose a “clear and present threat” that keeps enemy naval de-ployments in check.From a broader, regional perspective, in fact, stabilization of the U.S.-Chineserelationship depends to some extent on China’s deployment of long-range fire-power, including TBMs. The three “island chains” form an important compo-nent of U.S. national strategy in the western Pacific; they all serve to obstruct theChinese navy’s routes into the open ocean, thus restricting its scope of opera-tions to a narrow area. From a purely military perspective, the ideal forward po-sition of U.S. forces should be the “second island chain.” There they can avoiddirect contact with Chinese forces while relying on the superiority of U.S.long-range striking power, thereby containing China more effectively. However,it is quite obvious that the United States would not be able to pull back so far inthe short run—the Korean Peninsula, the Diaoyu [Senkaku] Islands, Taiwan,1 3 6 N A V A L W A R C O L L E G E R E V I E W4Naval War College Review, Vol. 61 [2008], No. 3, Art. 8https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/nwc-review/vol61/iss3/8and other regions of the “first island chain” are all in very unsettled phases intheir histories. In the absence of any strategic breathing space, were the UnitedStates rashly to withdraw its forces from these places, chaos would surely ensue,and effective control might well be forfeited.Having in mind the technological disparities in any potential Sino-Americanconflict, China’s primary concern with regard to long-range firepower deliverymust be the penetration capability of its delivery platforms against U.S. defensesystems, not cost-benefit calculations. If one again considers grand strategy, war,from China’s point of view, would be an unfortunate instrument of last resort,not one by which China can pursue interests beyond its fundamental interests;therefore China’s understanding of cost-effectiveness would not be the same asthat of the United States. For that reason, the TBM plays the important role itdoes: as long as China possesses sufficient capability for long-range firepowerdelivery, in any outbreak of hostilities between China and the United States theTBM would make the American bases spread out along the first island chain“chopping blocks” for China’s firepower and increase the costs to the UnitedStates of a war enormously. U.S. war calculations are made according to “cost ac-counting”; in reality, however, American forces based along the first island chainhave become unwilling hostages in the strategic chess match between China andthe United States.The result is that for a very long time, in the western Pacific and even else-where, China and the United States have significantly lowered the chances ofconflict, though they view each other with great anxiety. Also, in an era of peace,the island-chains containment strategy has in fact little practical effect in im-peding China’s development—and for China at the present stage, nothing ismore important than a stable environment for development.FUNDAMENTALS OF TACTICAL BALLISTIC MISSILE STRIKESAGAINST SEA TARGETSReports to the effect that “the Chinese armed forces are exploring ballistic mis-sile attacks against aircraft carriers” have surfaced time and again in the media.Therefore, it is necessary to explain in simple terms the technical aspects of thisquestion. This article does not seek to prove or predict anything; the authorwishes only to discuss the feasibility of TBM attacks against moving targets onthe surface of the ocean, from a nonspecialist perspective.Suppose ballistic missiles are flying toward a formation of surface ships (letus tentatively defer the question of whether the missiles will hit or not). Alsosuppose that in response the vessels attempt to intercept them. Beyond doubt,the probability of successful interception, even if not zero, will certainly be farless than it would be of intercepting either aircraft or cruise missiles, since, asW A N G W E I 1 3 75Wei: Research & DebatePublished by U.S. Naval War College Digital Commons, 2008stated previously, the ballistic missile has a greater penetration capability againstarea-defense systems.The next question is whether ballistic missiles are capable of hitting movingsurface ships. The current conventional wisdom, on the Internet and in othermedia outlets, generally holds that as ballistic missiles were originally designedto attack fixed targets on land, moving targets on water greatly increase the tech-nical difficulties. But in reality, it is hard to make a straightforward comparison.First, the maximum speed of current large or medium-sized surface ships isaround thirty knots. Compared to that of ballistic missiles, which travel at manytimes the speed of sound, up to Mach 10 and beyond, the mobility of surfaceships is very limited. At least, ballistic missiles striking targets at sea seems morereasonable than ground-based missile-defense systems intercepting incomingmissiles. As the latter have achieved some important milestones, it can be as-sumed that developing ballistic missiles for deployment against targets at seawould require merely reintegration of specific technologies, not a quantum leapin the overall technological level.Second, surface targets on water contrast more sharply against their back-ground and are much easier to locate than targets in complex terrain or “hardtargets” underground. Finally, compared with ground-based weapon systemsthat can be deployed in a dispersed arrangement, surface ships are highly inte-grated platforms, and this means that their survivability in combat is lower.Thus, while it is difficult to imagine one or two conventionally armed guidedmissiles paralyzing an air base, the same firepower delivered against an aircraftcarrier could easily cost it the ability to launch and recover aircraft. Admittedly,from a systems perspective, evaluating the cost-effectiveness of ballistic missilesused against surface ships, if technology permits it, will not be so clear-cut.From an engineering standpoint, the key to ballistic missile strikes againsttargets at sea lies, in the author’s opinion, in the preparation of the maritime bat-tlefield. That is to say, a prerequisite of attacks against mobile targets is solvingsuch problems as precise reconnaissance and positioning, data exchange, etc.Preparation of the maritime battlefield will require marine surveillance satel-lites, electronic reconnaissance satellites, imaging reconnaissance satellites,communication satellites, and other space-based systems; airborne early warn-ing aircraft, unmanned reconnaissance aircraft, and other airborne systems; andshore-based over-the-horizon radars, underwater sonar arrays, and the like.These systems must be viewed as a “public investment”—parts of a comprehen-sive naval combat system.Between the launch of a ballistic missile and impact, there is an interval dur-ing which targeted vessels may attempt to escape. The flight of a ballistic missilewith a range of 1,500 kilometers, for example, takes eight to ten minutes; in that1 3 8 N A V A L W A R C O L L E G E R E V I E W6Naval War College Review, Vol. 61 [2008], No. 3, Art. 8https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/nwc-review/vol61/iss3/8time a surface target, if its speed is thirty knots, can move about three nauticalmiles. Therefore, to ensure that the ballistic missile hits its target, its trajectoryneeds to be adjusted in flight. Certain ballistic missiles, such as the Russian SS-27Topol-M, already employ various technologies to maneuver in space. These ma-neuvers, however, are preprogrammed attempts to evade enemy interception;they are not the type of course adjustment we are discussing here. However, ac-cording to public reports, China’s “Shenzhou” spacecraft successfully carriedout orbital adjustments during its experimental flights. Therefore, we can as-sume that for China there will be no technological bottlenecks in controlled ma-neuvers for ballistic missiles in space.Alternatively, midcourse-phase course-correction data can be fed to a missilefrom an external source—what is known as command guidance. Or, the missilecan carry its own radar or other sensors to detect the target from high altitudeand provide trajectory-correction information.Reentry-phase guidance, such as air rudders, microrocket motors, and otherterminal-phase guidance technologies, has been used since the “Pershing” mis-sile developed during the Cold War era. TBMs currently in Chinese service alsouse this kind of technology. Thus, it can be assumed that technical problemswith respect to the missile itself are not insurmountable. Moreover, it might bepossible, following reentry into the atmosphere, to reduce the speed of the war-head in order to adjust its trajectory. Alternatively, multiple missiles may be em-ployed in “precision firepower coverage” tactics against escape routes.It is not the purpose of this article to solve engineering and technical prob-lems. The above discussion is simply to make clear what follows, with regard tonaval combat systems—that a TBM maritime strike system will give the Chinesemilitary an asymmetrical means of firepower delivery in any future conflict atsea. Developments in antimissile technology have reached such a point that bal-listic missiles are no longer absolutely impossible to resist. But at the same time,in any actual confrontation the unequal effectiveness of offensive and defensivesystems gives the ballistic missile an advantage. However, tactical ballistic mis-siles cannot replace aircraft carriers, submarines, and other traditional navalweapons. The major difference is like that between “special forces” and “regularforces”—ballistic missiles can be used to destroy enemy forces at sea but not toachieve absolute sea control, let alone to project maritime power.Let us now return to the strategic level. The relative impacts of military sys-tems on the outcome of a conflict generally become more obvious as the conflictintensifies. Employing the J-7 aircraft or even the J-6 to counter F-14s andFA-18s may not be a problem during peacetime, but in a life-or-death situation,the qualitative discrepancies could bring disastrous consequences.

Here, we test the hypothesis that the development of extra-somatic weapons could have influenced the evolution of human cooperative behaviour, thus providing a new explanation for these two puzzles. Widespread weapons use could have made disputes within hominin groups far more lethal and also equalized power between individuals. In such a cultural niche non-cooperators might well have become involved in such lethal disputes at a higher frequency than cooperators, thereby increasing the relative fitness of genes associated with cooperative behaviour. We employ two versions of the evolutionary Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma (IPD) model – one where weapons use is simulated and one where it is not. We then measured the performance of 25 IPD strategies to evaluate the effects of weapons use on them. We found that cooperative strategies performed significantly better, and non-cooperative strategies significantly worse, under simulated weapons use. Importantly, the performance of an ‘Always Cooperate ’ IPD strategy, equivalent to that of ‘strong reciprocity’, improved significantly more than that of all other cooperative strategies. We conclude that the development of extra-somatic weapons throws new light on the evolution of human altruistic and cooperative behaviour, and particularly ‘strong reciprocity’. The notion that distinctively human altruism and cooperation could have been an adaptive trait in a past environment that is no longer evident in the modern world provides a nove",,text,,,
novel weapons hypothesis,440406088,Innovation Mirage: The Role of Technological Uncertainty in Military Instability,10.24833/2071-8160-2020-6-75-7-52,I. A. Istomin,2020,"The article examines the impact of technological changes on the risks of military clashes between states. Currently, experts express increasing concerns about the destabilizing effect of new weapons (including anti-missile and anti-satellite weapons, hypersonic missiles, autonomous lethal systems, and artificial intelligence). These assessments are rarely based on solid theoretical foundations. The author seeks to fill this gap, arguing that the emergence of new weapons has a negative impact on international stability, and this effect is weakly related to the specific characteristics of underline technologies. The theory of technological uncertainty offers an alternative to the offense-defense balance theory. The latter developed since the 1970s, but its validity is questionable. The theory of technological uncertainty attributes the destabilizing effect of weapons to the divergence of states' perceptions of the balance of powers, to the hyped expectations regarding the ability to compensate quantitative limitations with qualitative superiority, to the alarmistic sense of closing windows of opportunities and growing vulnerabilities. The article tests the theory against the historical record of military clashes in Europe from the end of the 18th to the middle of the 20th centuries, as well as the crises between superpowers during the Cold War. The empirical cases are selected in order to cover the period marked by the intensification of qualitative arms races between states. In addition, it is also the period most often used to substantiate the offense-defense balance theory. The history of the last two and a half centuries provides a solid foundation for the theory of technological uncertainty. All instances of large-scale military clashes were preceded by significant technological changes, while peace fell on periods of technological stagnation. The author addresses the policy implications of the theory for the discussions on emerging weapons in the 2010s and 2020s. The study confirms that concerns regarding their destabilizing effect are justified, but for the different reasons from those put forward by most analysts. A somewhat optimistic caveat to its conclusions is the fact that currently emerging weapons are at various stages of development. The greatest likelihood of military clashes corresponds to the overlap of several technological uncertainties. Therefore, an increase in the time lag between introduction of various arms can mitigate destabilizing effect",,article,"arms, technology, war, balance of power, perception, revolution in military affairs, window of opportunities, great powers, military force, International relations, JZ2-6530",MGIMO Review of International Relations,MGIMO University Press

novel weapons hypothesis,40000355,Non-intrusive detection of concealed weapons by excitation of their complex natural resonances,,"Cole, Shawn Edward",2013,"A novel set of techniques have been developed and utilized for the detection and identification of concealed objects such as guns and knives. It is envisaged that such a device would be deployed in sensitive security areas such as those found in airports, banks and conferences. Identification of weapons that are most likely to be concealed on-body, such as guns and knives has been demonstrated in an anechoic environment at stand-off distances. The identification of concealed weapons such as guns and knives relies on the excitation of these objects complex natural resonances (CNR). The CNR are excited by an incident Ultra-Wide band (UWB) electromagnetic pulse (or by frequency domain pulse synthesis), were the equivalent wavelengths are commensurate to the linear dimensions of the object and is thus closely related to, the comprehensively studied and reported, Mie scattering for a conducting sphere. An object's CNR spectrum is strongly independent of the orientation of the object, and therefore the CNR may be used as an aspect independent identification system. Initial experiments and finite element simulations clearly demonstrated the limitations of a bi-static radar method and a different approach was investigated which uses an phased array of UWB antennae consisting of multiple transceivers. With a phased array antenna system it is possible to spatially locate metallic object(s) and identify them based upon their characteristic CNR. Spatial location of conducting objects is achieved by locating significant 'Late Time Response' (LTR). Once an object is spatially located by the presence of a significant L TR, the transient may then he analysed to reveal the object's CNR and identification can then be made. The aspect independent CNR of an object are more prominent and obtainable when using a phased array system in comparison to a conventional hi-static radar setup.EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo",,"U - Thesis, Thesis (Ph.D.)","130 - Mechanical, industrial, civil and marine engineering, general",,

The behavior of rogue states has been branded irrational, which makes many of the traditional claims of deterrence useless. Other factors have to be found if it is to succeed.

New hypotheses for how phenotypically plastic traits interact during development and selection,10.1111/evo.14464,"Nielsen, Matthew E., Papaj, Daniel R.",2022,"Organisms can often respond adaptively to a change in their environment through phenotypic plasticity in multiple traits, a phenomenon termed as multivariate plasticity. These different plastic responses could interact and affect each other's development as well as selection on each other, but the causes and consequences of these interactions have received relatively little attention. Here, we propose a new conceptual framework for understanding how different plastic responses can affect each other's development and why organisms should have multiple plastic responses. A plastic change in one trait could alter the phenotype of a second plastic trait by changing either the cue received by the organism (cue-mediated effect) or the response to that cue (response-mediated effect). Multivariate plasticity could benefit the organism either because the plastic responses work better when expressed together (synergy) or because each response is more effective under different environmental circumstances (complementarity). We illustrate these hypotheses with case studies, focusing on interactions between behavior and morphology, plastic traits that differ in their reversibility. Future empirical and theoretical research should investigate the consequences of these interactions for additional factors important for the evolution of plasticity, such as the limits and costs of plasticity.Open access articleThis item from the UA Faculty Publications collection is made available by the University of Arizona with support from the University of Arizona Libraries.

phenotypic plasticity hypothesis,103971417,REVIEW Open Access Plasticity as a developing trait: exploring the implications,,Marco Del Giudice,2014,"Individual differences in plasticity have been classically framed as genotype-by-environment interactions, with different genotypes showing different reaction norms in response to environmental conditions. However, research has shown that early experience can be a critical factor in shaping an individual’s plasticity to later environmental factors. In other words, plasticity itself can be investigated as a developing trait that reflects the combined action of an individual’s genes and previous interactions with the environment. In this paper I explore some implications of the idea that the early environment modulates long-term plasticity, with an emphasis on plasticity in behavioral traits. I begin by focusing on the mechanisms that mediate plasticity at the proximate level, and discussing the possibility that some traits may work as generalized mediators of plasticity by affecting the sensitivity of multiple phenol types across developmental contexts. I then tackle the complex problem of the evolution of reaction norms for plasticity. Next, I consider a number of potential implications for research on parental effects and phenotypic matching, and conclude by discussing how plasticity may become a target of evolutionary conflict between parents and offspring. In total, I aim to show how the idea of plasticity as a developing trait offers a rich source of questions and insights that may inform future research in this area",,text,,,
phenotypic plasticity hypothesis,100628576,"BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC.",,H. Frederik Nijhout,2014,"Phenotypic plasticity is the primitive character state for most if not all traits. Insofar as developmental and physiological processes obey the laws of chemistry and physics, they will be sensitive to such environmental vari-ables as temperature, nutrient supply, ionic environment, and the availability of various macro- and micronutrients. De-pending on the effect this phenotypic plasticity has on fitness, evolution may proceed to select either for mechanisms that buffer or canalize the phenotype against relevant environ-mental variation or for a modified plastic response in which some ranges of the phenotypic variation are adaptive to partic-ular environments. Phenotypic plasticity can be continuous, in which case it is called a reaction norm, or discontinuous, in which case it is called a polyphenism. Although the mor-phological discontinuity of some polyphenisms is produced by discrete developmental switches, most polyphenisms are due to discontinuities in the environment that induce only por-tions of what is in reality a continuous reaction norm. In insect polyphenisms, the environmental variable that induces the al-ternative phenotype is a token stimulus that serves as a pre-dictor of, but is not itself, the environment to which the polyphenism is an adaptation. In all cases studied so far, the environmental stimulus alters the endocrine mechanism of metamorphosis by altering either the pattern of hormone secretion or the pattern of hormone sensitivity in different tis-sues. Such changes in the patterns of endocrine interactions result in the execution of alternative developmental path-ways. The spatial and temporal compartmentalization of endocrine interactions has produced a developmental mech-anism that enables substantial localized changes in morphol-ogy that remain well integrated into the structure and function of the organism",,text,,,

It has been suggested that phenotypic integration, the structure of trait covariation, could limit trait plasticity. However, the relationship between plasticity and integration is far from resolved. Using a database of functional plasticity to drought of a Mediterranean shrub that included 20 ecophysiological traits, we assessed environmentally-induced changes in phenotypic integration and whether integration constrained the expression of plasticity, accounting for thewithin-environment phenotypic variation of traits. Furthermore, we provide the first test of the association between differential trait plasticity and trait integration across an optimumand a stressful environment. Phenotypic plasticity was positively associated with phenotypic integration in both environments, but this relationship was lost when phenotypic variation was considered. The similarityin the plastic response of two traits predicted their integration across environments, with integrated traits having more similar plasticity. Such variation in the plasticity of traits partly explained the lower phenotypic integration found in the stressful environment. We found no evidence that integration may constitute an internal constraint to plasticity.

In 1965, British biologist A. D. Bradshaw proposed a widely cited model intended to explain the evolution of norms of reaction, based on his studies of plant populations. Bradshaw’s model went beyond the notion of the “adaptive norm of reaction” discussed before him by Dobzhansky and Schmalhausen by suggesting that “plasticity” – the ability of a phenotype to be modified by the environment – should be genetically determined. To prove Bradshaw’s hypothesis, it became necessary for some authors to identify the pressures exerted by natural selection on phenotypic plasticity in particular traits, and thus to model its evolution. In this paper, I contrast two different views, based on quantitative genetic models, proposed in the mid-1980s: Russell Lande and Sara Via’s conception of phenotypic plasticity, which assumes that the evolution of plasticity is linked to the evolution of the plastic trait itself, and Samuel Scheiner and Richard Lyman’s view, which assumes that the evolution of plasticity is independent from the evolution of the trait.

Phenotypic plasticity occurs in many forms and at many biological scales, and its adaptive value depends on the specific environment and interactions with other plant traits and organisms. Even though plasticity is the norm rather than the exception, its complex nature has been a challenge in characterizing the expression of plasticity, its adaptive value for fitness and the environmental cues that regulate its expression.ScopeThis review discusses the characterization and costs of plasticity and approaches, considerations, and promising research directions in studying plasticity. Phenotypic plasticity is genetically controlled and heritable; however, little is known about how organisms perceive, interpret and respond to environmental cues, and the genes and pathways associated with plasticity. Not every genotype is plastic for every trait, and plasticity is not infinite, suggesting trade-offs, costs and limits to expression of plasticity. The timing, specificity and duration of plasticity are critical to their adaptive value for plant fitness.ConclusionsThere are many research opportunities to advance our understanding of plant phenotypic plasticity.

Different components of phenotypic variation can be distinguished that correspond to those inputs, but the response of the system to each input factor can be modulated by other factors, so that there are interactions among the factors. This paper uses the concept of the target phenotype, introduced by Nijhout and Davidowitz to designate the expected phenotype for a given genotype and environment, to provide definitions and explanations of key concepts. This logic is put to use to explore the factors contributing to fluctuating asymmetry. To illustrate how genetic variation, phenotypic plasticity in response to temperature variation, and random developmental noise interact, this study uses computer simulations based on a simplified developmental model of a trait. The simulations show extensive interactions among the input factors, which can be explained by the non-linear nature of the developmental model. As a result, all the loci that control the developmental parameters end up affecting the resulting phenotypic trait, its reaction norm in response to temperature changes, and also its fluctuating asymmetry. Further, temperature (or possibly other environmental factors) can affect both trait values and the amount of fluctuating asymmetry without any involvement of stress.

The Predictive Adaptive Response (PAR) hypothesis refers to a form of developmental plasticity in which cues received in early life influence the development of a phenotype that is normally adapted to the environmental conditions of later life. When the predicted and actual environments differ, the mismatch between the individual's phenotype and the conditions in which it finds itself can have adverse consequences for Darwinian fitness and, later, for health. Numerous examples exist of the long-term effects of cues indicating a threatening environment affecting the subsequent phenotype of the individual organism. Other examples consist of the long-term effects of variations in environment within a normal range, particularly in the individual's nutritional environment. In mammals the cues to developing offspring are often provided by the mother's plane of nutrition, her body composition or stress levels. This hypothetical effect in humans is thought to be important by some scientists and controversial by others. In resolving the conflict, distinctions should be drawn between PARs induced by normative variations in the developmental environment and the ill effects on development of extremes in environment such as a very poor or very rich nutritional environment.

Accordingly,numerous theoretical and empirical studies have examined properties and consequences of plasticity, primarily considering traitsthat are continuously distributed on observed phenotypic scales with linear reaction norms. However, many environmentally sen-sitive traits are expressed as discrete alternative phenotypes and are appropriately characterized as quantitative genetic thresholdtraits. Here, we highlight that forms of phenotypic plasticity, genetic variation, and inheritance in plasticity, and outcomes of selec-tion on plasticity, could differ substantially between threshold traits and continuously distributed traits (as are typically considered).We thereby highlight theoretical developments that are required to rationalize and predict phenotypic and microevolutionary dy-namics involving plastic threshold traits, and outline how intrinsic properties of such traits could provide relatively straightforwardexplanations for apparently idiosyncratic observed patterns of phenotypic variation.

Specifically, plasticity directly allows short-termphenotypic responses within and/or across generations, whichcould currently be adaptive, nonadaptive, or maladaptive (e.g.,Agrawal et al. 1999; Ghalambor et al. 2007; Beaman et al. 2016;Donelson et al. 2018; Arnold et al. 2019a). Theory also showshow plasticity could affect persistence of populations experienc-ing directional environmental change (Chevin et al. 2010), andfacilitate longer term evolutionary adaptation to novel environ-ments through rapid expression and evolution of plastic responsesfollowed by genetic assimilation (Lande 2009, 2015). Rational-izing current forms of plasticity, and quantifying drivers of andconstraints on future evolutionary changes, will consequently becentral to understanding and predicting phenotypic, populationdynamic, and evolutionary outcomes across multiple spatial andtemporal scales (Gavrilets and Scheiner 1993a; Scheiner 1993;Chevin et al. 2010; Lande 2014; Murren et al. 2014; Ehrenreichand Pfennig 2016; Chevin and Hoffmann 2017; Kelly 2019).In general, such outcomes depend on numerous propertiesof focal systems, including (i) forms and magnitudes of plastic-ity in ecologically relevant traits that affect fitness; (ii) resultingselection acting on such traits and on trait plasticity; and (iii)components of additive genetic (co)variation involving plastic-ity, and resulting patterns of inheritance and potential for plastic-ity evolution and genetic assimilation.

Summary of key terminology.Term DefinitionPhenotypic plasticity Ability of single genotypes to produce different phenotypes in different environments,resulting in directly observable phenotypic variation across environments.Developmental plasticity Plasticity in traits that are permanently and nonreversibly expressed once in an individual’slife, through environment-dependent initial development. Directly evident when individualsfrom the same lineage are exposed to different initial environmental conditions, resulting inpermanent among-individual variation.Labile plasticity Plasticity in traits that are repeatedly and hence potentially reversibly re-expressed multipletimes through an individual’s life. Directly evident when individuals experience changingenvironmental conditions, resulting in longitudinal within-individual variation.Threshold trait A trait that shows two (or more) discrete phenotypic states, where phenotypic expressiondirectly depends on the value of an underlying “liability” relative to a threshold.Liability A latent quantitative genetic trait that can comprise genetic and environmental components,and that translates deterministically into expression of alternative discrete phenotypes whenabove versus below a threshold.Latent plasticity Environmentally induced variation in liability. Such latent plasticity is not necessarilymanifested as observable phenotypic plasticity, depending on whether it causes the liabilityto cross the threshold. Latent plasticity can be developmental and/or labile.exert their effects in the contexts of environmental variability andpredictability across episodes of trait development and expres-sion versus selection (Scheiner 1993; DeWitt et al. 1998; de Jong2005; Lande 2009, 2014, 2015; Chevin et al. 2010; Ashanderet al. 2016; Chevin and Hoffmann 2017; Donelson et al. 2018).Accordingly, numerous empirical studies aim to quantify formsof plasticity in focal traits in experimental or wild populations,and to estimate components of selection and underlying addi-tive genetic (co)variances (Scheiner 1993; Pigliucci 2005; Char-mantier and Gienapp 2014; Murren et al. 2014; Hendry 2016;Chevin and Hoffmann 2017; Arnold et al. 2019a; Kelly 2019).However, many recent theoretical and empirical studies, andconceptual reviews, invoke a key assumption that relationshipsbetween expressed phenotypes and underlying environmentalvariables are linear on observed phenotypic scales (i.e., linearphenotypic reaction norms, e.g., Nussey et al. 2007; Lande 2009,2014, 2015; Chevin et al. 2010; Dingemanse et al. 2010; Chevinand Hoffmann 2017; Arnold et al. 2019a), with extensions toconsider polynomial functions (Gavrilets and Scheiner 1993a,b;Scheiner 1993; de Jong 2005; Morrissey and Leifting 2016). Suchlinearities are commonly invoked to facilitate mathematical, sta-tistical, and/or verbal tractability, not necessarily because thereis strong evidence or belief that phenotype-environment relation-ships will typically be straightforwardly linear in nature (notedby Gavrilets and Scheiner 1993b; Nussey et al. 2007; Lande2009, 2014; Chevin et al. 2010; Dingemanse et al. 2010; Chevinand Hoffmann 2017). Indeed, many ecologically important traitsthat could substantially affect population responses to varyingand changing environments show markedly nonlinear phenotypicchanges, which also do not directly conform to simple polyno-mial functions (Valladares et al. 2006; Chevin et al. 2010; Murrenet al. 2014; Beaman et al. 2016; Arnold et al. 2019b).Not least, many important morphological, behavioral, andlife-history traits expressed across the natural world show two(or more) approximately discrete phenotypic states, whose ex-pression partly depends on current and/or previous environ-ments (West-Eberhard 1989; Scheiner 1993; Roff 1996). Forexample, such traits encompass dichotomous movements, mat-ing behaviors, and reproductive parameters alongside alterna-tive morphological developments. Given some polygenic basis,such traits can be appropriately conceptualized as quantitativegenetic “threshold traits,” where an underlying “liability” trans-lates into expression of alternative discrete phenotypes whenabove versus below a threshold (Falconer and Mackay 1996; Roff1996). Such threshold traits are well known to have distinctiveintrinsic genetic and microevolutionary properties compared tostandard quantitative traits that are continuously distributed onobserved phenotypic scales. For example, they can maintain sub-stantial “cryptic” genetic variation that is not typically pheno-typically expressed, and phenotypic heritability, selection inten-sity, and evolutionary responses all depend on phenotype fre-quencies (Gianola 1982; Roff 1994a, 1996, 1998a; Falconerand Mackay 1996, Ch. 18; Lynch and Walsh 1998, Ch. 25;Moorad and Linksvayer 2008). However, the ways in whichthreshold traits could also show distinctive intrinsic forms andproperties of phenotypic plasticity, and hence foster distinc-tive patterns of short-term phenotypic variation and longer termmicroevolutionary outcomes in varying and changing environ-ments, have received surprisingly little explicit attention. Becauserapid plastic expression of alternative discrete phenotypes couldEVOLUTION FEBRUARY 2022 191PERSPECTIVEdramatically affect population outcomes, and even flip popula-tions between alternative ecological states, such properties andtheir consequences should be fully incorporated into moderntreatments of plasticity and its implications.Accordingly, we highlight multiple intrinsic properties ofthreshold traits that could cause distinctive patterns of phe-notypic plasticity, and drive distinctive phenotypic and mi-croevolutionary outcomes, that differ substantially from thoseinvolving traits that are continuously distributed on observed phe-notypic scales. We thereby outline key attributes that should beincorporated into (eco)evolutionary theory for dichotomous traitsand quantified empirically, and summarize how such advancescould be achieved. To provide necessary context for our focuson threshold traits and facilitate comparisons, we first synthesizecore principles of plasticity in continuously distributed traits, asare currently widely envisaged. Key terminologies are summa-rized in Table 1.Concepts of Plasticity in ContinuousTraitsPlasticity in continuously distributed quantitative traits is com-monly conceptualized and quantified in two different ways bydiffering groups of researchers. First, experimental evolutionarybiologists commonly measure plasticity by splitting families orclones across different (known) environments and measuring re-sulting mean phenotypes in each environment (Fig. 1A). Plas-ticity is therefore typically viewed as among-individual pheno-typic variation within families or genotypes and hence withinlineages, often focusing on traits that are effectively expressedonce as the culmination of initial development (here termed de-velopmental plasticity [Table 1; Fig. 1A], elsewhere termed fixed,irreversible, or “one-shot” plasticity [Scheiner 1993, 2002; vanBuskirk and Steiner 2009; Auld et al. 2010; Lande 2015; Hendry2016]). Such developmental plasticity is also the primary fo-cus of most theory on plasticity evolution and its implications,which typically considers relationships between environments oftrait development versus selection and assumes nonzero additivegenetic variation in developmental reaction norm slopes (e.g.,Gavrilets and Scheiner 1993a; Lande 2009, 2015; Ashander et al.2016). Such genetic variation, and potential covariation with de-velopmental reaction norm intercepts, can be evaluated empiri-cally through quantitative genetic experiments that split sufficientfamilies across environments (Fig. 1A; Scheiner 1993; Pigliucci2005; Arnold et al. 2019b), and/or through experimental evolu-tion (Scheiner 2002).Second, in wild animal evolutionary ecology and behav-ioral ecology, where families or clones often cannot be so readilycreated or manipulated, plasticity is typically measured as chang-ing phenotypes of single individuals when exposed to differ-ent environments (Fig. 1B). It is consequently viewed as lon-gitudinal within-individual phenotypic variation, evidenced byindividual-level reaction norm slopes that differ from zero. Ittherefore necessarily concerns flexible traits that individuals ex-press multiple times (termed labile plasticity, Table 1; Fig. 1B;Nussey et al. 2007; Dingemanse et al. 2010; Dingemanse andWolf 2013; Charmantier and Gienapp 2014; Lande 2014, 2015;Hendry 2016).Since developmental plasticity and labile plasticity can in-duce differing short-term phenotypic dynamics and longer termevolutionary dynamics (e.g., Lande 2009, 2014, 2015, 2019), yetcould co-occur and interact, both ideally need to be combinedinto a single holistic conceptual framework that encompassesoverall phenotypic variation resulting from initial developmentand subsequent environmental impacts (Beaman et al. 2016).This can in principle be achieved through quantitative geneticapproaches that fully consider interacting environmental and ge-netic effects on overall individual reaction norms, encompass-ing intercepts (i.e., elevations), slopes, and intercept-slope andslope-slope covariances across developmental and labile plastic-ity (Fig. 1C; Supporting Information S1).Here, individual reaction norm intercepts can reflect the out-come of developmental plasticity, resulting in lasting effects onan individual’s mean phenotype as shaped by its developmen-tal reaction norm and early-life environmental experience (red,Fig. 1C). The developmental reaction norm intercept and slopecould in turn show additive genetic (co)variation, as commonlyconsidered in theoretical and empirical studies focusing solelyon developmental plasticity (Fig. 1A). Meanwhile, variation inindividual reaction norm slopes (blue, Fig. 1C) could reflect di-rect additive genetic effects, representing genetic variation in la-bile plasticity, and/or permanent environmental effects includingfurther legacies of developmental plasticity. For example, an indi-vidual’s mean phenotype, as shaped by developmental plasticity,could affect its ability to subsequently express labile plasticity.Complex genetic and/or environmental intercept-slope covari-ances for overall reaction norms could then arise, for example, ifindividuals with low phenotypic intercepts typically haveshallower (or steeper) phenotypic reaction norm slopes thanindividuals with higher intercepts (Fig. 1C; Supporting Informa-tion S1; Nussey et al. 2007; Dingemanse and Wolf 2013).In simple cases with linear reaction norms for both devel-opmental and labile plasticity (e.g., Fig. 1A, B), the full quanti-tative genetic architecture of the overall individual reaction norm(e.g., Fig. 1C) can then be conceptualized as a three-parameter G-matrix (i.e., additive genetic variance-covariance matrix). Here,the three elementary parameters comprise the intercept and slopeof the reaction norm for developmental plasticity (which togethershape the intercept of the overall individual reaction norm), andthe slope of the reaction norm for labile plasticity (Supporting192 EVOLUTION FEBRUARY 2022PERSPECTIVEFigure 1. Illustrations of phenotypic plasticity in continuously distributed quantitative traits conceptualized as: (A) the change in meanphenotype when different individuals from split families or clones are exposed to different discrete environments (labelled i–iii), typicallyfocusing on developmental plasticity. Red and gray points depict individuals from two different lineages. Dashed lines depict the lineagereaction norm for developmental plasticity, assumed to be effectively linear. Here, the gray lineage has a higher reaction norm intercept(and hence mean phenotypic value) and also a steeper reaction norm slope, implying greater developmental plasticity; (B) the changein phenotype when a single individual is exposed to different environments within a continuous range of variation, representing labileplasticity. Blue points depict repeat observations of the individual, and the solid line depicts the individual reaction norm for labileplasticity inferred from linear regression of phenotype on environment, with microenvironmental deviations; (C) overall reaction normintercepts, slopes, and their covariancemeasured among andwithin four individuals. Red points depict individuals’ developed phenotypesin a reference environment (as in panel A, shown here as the intercepts of individuals’ overall reaction norms, but could be standardizedto a mean environment). Red dotted lines depict the development process, shaped by the intercept and slope of the underlying reactionnorm for developmental plasticity. Blue lines depict individuals’ reaction norms for labile plasticity (as in panel B). Nonparallel lines couldindicate gene-by-environment interactions (G×E; Supporting Information S2). Slopes of reaction norms for developmental and labileplasticity could also be correlated. (D) Scenario of directional selection on reaction norm slope, where lineages or individuals with steeppositive slopes have higher (or lower) fitness than those with shallow slopes, with relative fitness denoted by differing shades of gray.Lower fitness lineages would gradually be selected out, reducing G×E. In the depicted example, directional selection on slope could alsocause or be caused by indirect selection through correlated intercepts. (E) Expected patterns of additive genetic inheritance, where pairsof parents with different reaction norm intercepts and slopes close to zero (dark gray lines) or slopes with opposite signs (light gray lines)produce offspring with intermediate intercepts and slopes close to zero (dashed line).EVOLUTION FEBRUARY 2022 193PERSPECTIVEInformation S1). These three parameters could be positively ornegatively genetically correlated (or uncorrelated), potentiallyimplying composite constraints on the form of additive geneticvariation available to allow evolutionary responses to selectionon any characteristic of the overall individual reaction norm (e.g.,Gomulkiewicz and Kirkpatrick 1992; Nussey et al. 2007; Walshand Blows 2009). For example, if reaction norm slopes for de-velopmental and labile plasticity are strongly positively or nega-tively correlated, then evolution of both could be exacerbated orinhibited given particular regimes of selection.This three-trait conceptualization of overall plasticity com-bines and advances current standard conceptualizations of lin-ear reaction norms, which typically focus on either developmen-tal plasticity or labile plasticity but not both. Such conceptual-izations effectively generate two-parameter models that considersingle intercepts and slopes (Supporting Information S1). Yet, thebasic premise that environmentally induced phenotypic variationin continuously distributed quantitative traits is adequately de-scribed through linear (or polynomial) reaction norms for devel-opmental and/or labile plasticity expressed on observed pheno-typic scales implies multiple intrinsic properties of genetic varia-tion in, selection on, and inheritance of plasticity (Table 2). Theseproperties are fundamental to mathematical and verbal theory re-garding the implications of plasticity for population dynamic andevolutionary outcomes, and have motivated and underpinned nu-merous empirical examinations.Key Properties of Plasticity inContinuous TraitsFirst, ongoing evolution of the degree of phenotypic plasticity(whether developmental and/or labile) in continuously distributedtraits is envisaged to involve evolution of reaction norm slopes.Such evolution in turn requires nonzero additive genetic varia-tion in slope (and/or in other parameters describing polynomialreaction norm shapes; Gavrilets and Scheiner 1993a,b; Scheiner1993, 2002; de Jong and Gavrilets 2000; Nussey et al. 2007;Lande 2009, 2014; Ashander et al. 2016; Arnold et al. 2019b).This implies existence of gene-by-environment interactions onthe observed phenotypic scale (i.e., nonzero G×E shaping devel-opmental and/or labile plasticity), meaning that genetic effects onphenotypes vary among environments (Fig. 1C; Table 2). Givenlinear reaction norms, nonzero G×E can readily cause substan-tially greater additive genetic variation in phenotypes in more ex-treme (i.e., unusual) environments. This is especially likely givensome canalization of mean phenotype (and hence little additivegenetic variation) in typical environments that a population haspreviously frequently experienced, due to long-term stabilizingselection (e.g., Nussey et al. 2007; Lande 2015). Such effectsgenerate potential for rapid evolutionary responses to selectionfollowing environmental change (Lande 2009; Ashander et al.2016). However, there will not necessarily be nonzero G×E inany particular system, and quantifying the form and magnitudeof G×E has been a major empirical endeavor in experimentalsystems (Scheiner 1993, 2002; Pigliucci 2005) and, increasingly,in free-living wild populations (Nussey et al. 2007; Charmantierand Gienapp 2014; Ramakers et al. 2018; Kelly 2019; SupportingInformation S2).Second, directional selection for or against phenotypic plas-ticity is envisaged to effectively exert directional selection on themagnitude of the reaction norm slope (either directly or indi-rectly through covariance with intercepts and hence trait means;Fig. 1D; Table 2; Scheiner 1993, 2002). Selection for increasedplasticity (i.e., favoring steeper slopes) can in principle arise ifincreased phenotypic sensitivity to environmental conditions in-creases fitness, irrespective of whether the sign of the optimalreaction norm slope is positive or negative (Arnold et al. 2019a).Meanwhile, selection against plasticity (i.e., favoring shallowerslopes) can arise if there are fitness costs of expressing differentor changing phenotypes or simply of maintaining physiologicalcapacities to do so (often termed induced vs. constitutive costs;DeWitt et al. 1998; van Buskirk and Steiner 2009; Auld et al.2010; Chevin et al. 2010; Arnold et al. 2019a). Overall stabiliz-ing selection around an optimal degree of plasticity, and hencearound an optimal reaction norm slope, could potentially result.If there is initially nonzero G×E (and hence additive ge-netic variation in reaction norm slopes), then directional selectioncould cause evolutionary changes in slope and hence in the de-gree of phenotypic plasticity. Yet, directional or stabilizing selec-tion could gradually erode additive genetic variation and dimin-ish G×E, reducing subsequent evolutionary responses (Fig. 1D;van Buskirk and Steiner 2009; Ehrenreich and Pfennig 2016;Saltz et al. 2018; but see Lande 2009). Further studies have con-sequently postulated mechanisms by which genetic variation inplasticity and associated evolutionary potential, and polymor-phisms comprising plastic and canalized (i.e., nonenvironmen-tally responsive) individuals, can be maintained (Wolf and Weiss-ing 2010; Dingemanse and Wolf 2013; Saltz et al. 2018). Forexample, combinations of negative frequency-dependent se-lection on plastic versus canalized phenotypes, and positivefeedbacks that reduce costs of repeated trait expression, havebeen invoked to explain ongoing coexistence of responsiveand unresponsive lineages (i.e., polymorphism in labile plas-ticity; Wolf et al. 2008; Wolf and Weissing 2010). In princi-ple, additive genetic variation in reaction norm slopes couldbe maintained through disruptive selection, where individualswith slopes of either extreme have consistently higher fitnessthan individuals with intermediate slopes, but such selectionseems unlikely to be commonplace (Saltz et al. 2018; SupportingInformation S2).194 EVOLUTION FEBRUARY 2022PERSPECTIVETable 2. Summary of key differences between typically assumed properties of traits that are continuously distributed on observedphenotypic scales (left column) versus properties of discrete threshold traits (right column), regarding (A) genetic variation in pheno-typic plasticity, (B) phenotypic variation in phenotypic plasticity, (C) selection on phenotypic plasticity, and (D) apparent inheritance ofphenotypic plasticity.Continuously distributed traits Threshold traits(A) • Genetic variation in phenotypic plasticity requiresgenetic variation in reaction norm slopes, and hencerequires gene-by-environment interactions (G×E) onthe observed phenotypic scale.• Such G×E, and hence genetic variation in phenotypicplasticity, will not necessarily be present.• G×E could be eroded by directional or stabilizingselection on phenotypic plasticity, and hence onreaction norm slope. Long-term maintenance ofadditive genetic variation (and hence phenotypicvariation) in phenotypic plasticity may thereforerequire further explanations.• With nonzero G×E and linear reaction norms andstabilizing selection on phenotypes in typicalenvironments, additive genetic variation in phenotypecan readily be greater in extreme environments,facilitating rapid evolutionary responses to selection.• Genetic variation in phenotypic plasticity could resultfrom genetic variation in liability-scale reaction normintercepts. It does not necessarily require geneticvariation in reaction norm slopes, or hence requiregene-by-environment interactions (G×E), on theliability scale.• If there is genetic variation in liability intercept, andphenotypic variation, there is likely to be geneticvariation in phenotypic plasticity.• Substantial additive genetic variation in interceptsand/or slopes of liability-scale reaction norms couldpotentially be maintained even given consistent strongdirectional selection. Genetic variation in phenotypicplasticity may therefore be revealed givenenvironmental variation or change, and require littlefurther explanation.• Genetic variation in phenotype will not necessarilyincrease, and could easily decrease toward zero, inextreme environments.(B) • A persistent mixture of highly phenotypically plasticand strongly environmentally canalized genotypes orindividuals requires some further explanation (e.g.,disruptive or negative frequency-dependent selectionon reaction norm slope).• The degree of phenotypic plasticity or canalizationdefined by the reaction norm slope can, in principle,be independent of the reaction norm intercept, andhence of population mean phenotype.• A persistent mixture of highly phenotypically plasticand strongly environmentally canalized genotypes orindividuals is likely. It requires little furtherexplanation beyond some mechanism maintainingvariation in liability that spans the threshold, andresulting expression of each alternative phenotype.• The mean degree of canalization (and hencerepeatability) of a particular discrete phenotype islinked to the mean liability-scale reaction normintercept, and is expected to increase with phenotypefrequency.(C) • Consistent directional selection for or againstphenotypic plasticity will cause consistent directionalselection on reaction norm slope.• Such selection could gradually erode G×E.• Consistent directional selection for or againstphenotypic plasticity could potentially causestabilizing or disruptive selection on liability intercept.The form of selection on liability could change asevolution progresses.• Such selection could potentially drive evolution ofcomplex forms of liability-scale G×E andintercept-slope covariances.(D) • Reproduction between highly canalized parents, orparents with opposite reaction norm slopes, willtypically result in highly phenotypically canalizedoffspring. Highly canalized parents cannot readilyproduce highly phenotypically plastic offspring.• Mutation or gene flow would be required to regenerateplasticity in canalized populations.• Reproduction between highly phenotypicallycanalized parents with different fixed phenotypes canreadily result in highly phenotypically plasticoffspring. Selection for or against plasticity mayconsequently impose indirect selection on matechoice.• Phenotypic plasticity (or canalization) could be hardto eradicate even given strong selection against it.EVOLUTION FEBRUARY 2022 195PERSPECTIVEThird, reaction norm parameters, and resulting forms of phe-notypic plasticity, are expected to adhere to basic principles ofadditive genetic inheritance given sexual reproduction. Conse-quently, matings between environmentally canalized parents (i.e.,with reaction norm slopes for developmental and/or labile plas-ticity that are close to zero) will typically produce canalizedoffspring (i.e., also with expected reaction norm slopes closeto zero), as could matings between parents with slopes of sim-ilar magnitudes but opposite signs (Fig. 1E; Table 2). How-ever, highly phenotypically canalized parents are unlikely to pro-duce highly plastic offspring (i.e., with very steep reaction normslopes), although such offspring could occasionally arise throughsampling variance around the expectation. Indeed, population-wide canalization across environments can be viewed as fixationof genetic variants that increase robustness to environmental vari-ation (Ehrenreich and Pfennig 2016). Additional sources of newgenetic variation in reaction norm slopes, whether from mutationor gene flow stemming from immigration given local adaptation,are then required to generate new developmental and/or labilephenotypic plasticity in currently phenotypically canalized pop-ulations (e.g., Saltz et al. 2018).The above properties and principles of genetic variation in,selection on, and inheritance of phenotypic plasticity in continu-ously distributed traits (Table 2) explicitly or implicitly underpinmuch theory regarding the expression, evolutionary dynamics,and consequences of plasticity. But such properties could be qual-itatively different for threshold traits, implying that the dynamicsand consequences of plasticity might also differ substantially.Concepts of Plasticity in ThresholdTraitsThe concept of a threshold trait (or “threshold character”) islong established in quantitative genetics, spanning animal breed-ing, medicine, and diverse areas of evolutionary biology (Wright1934; Gianola 1982; Falconer and Mackay 1996, Ch. 18; Roff1996, 1998a; Lynch and Walsh 1998, Ch. 25; Tomkins and Hazel2007; Moorad and Linksvayer 2008; Grossen et al. 2010; Pulido2011; Dodson et al. 2013; Hadfield 2015). In brief, each individ-ual is envisaged to have an underlying “liability,” defined as a la-tent (i.e., unobserved) continuously distributed quantitative traitthat can have multiple genetic and environmental components,and which causes expression of alternative discrete phenotypeswhen above versus below a threshold value (Table 1; Fig. 2A).Expression of the alternative phenotypes is envisaged to bedeterministic conditional on the liability (i.e., outcomes are notnecessarily directly probabilistic; Supporting Information S1).Substantial genetic and/or environmental variation in liability (oneither side of the threshold) can consequently exist without caus-ing any phenotypic variation.To date, properties of threshold traits have commonly beenconsidered for dichotomous traits that are effectively expressedonce through differential development, resulting in permanentlydifferent discrete phenotypes (e.g., skeletal structures; morpho-logical defenses against predation; winged [i.e., dispersive] vs.wingless forms; facultative diapause; sex; and fixed dichoto-mous reproductive and/or life-history strategies, among others,e.g., Roff 1994a, 1996; Falconer and Mackay 1996; Agrawalet al. 1999; Ostrowski et al. 2000; Bégin and Roff 2002; Hazelet al. 2004; Tomkins and Hazel 2007; Grossen et al. 2010; Dod-son et al. 2013; Snell-Rood et al. 2018; Debes et al. 2020).Here, phenotypic outcomes commonly depend partly on initialenvironmental conditions, representing developmental plasticity(Scheiner 1993; Roff 1996; Bégin and Roff 2002; Snell-Roodet al. 2018).However, as with many continuously distributed traits, manythreshold traits are re-expressed on time frames of hours, days,seasons, or years, potentially allowing labile plasticity manifestedas reversible individual expression of alternative phenotypeswhen exposed to different environments (i.e., within-individualphenotypic variation; Table 1). Obvious examples include di-chotomous behaviors, including diel movements and dominantversus subordinate mating tactics (e.g., Harrison et al. 2017;Crocker-Buta and Leary 2018); seasonal migration versus year-round residence (Brodersen et al. 2014; Reid et al. 2018, Reidet al. 2020); and diverse aspects of reproduction including breed-ing versus skipping, production of twins versus one offspring, ordivorce or extra-pair mating versus mate fidelity in iteroparousspecies (Falconer and Mackay 1996; Duthie et al. 2016; Ger-main et al. 2018). Key properties of plasticity in such thresh-old traits could differ quite fundamentally from those for con-tinuously distributed traits where linear (or polynomial) reactionnorms are manifested on observed phenotypic scales (Table 2).These properties and differences result from forms of genetic andenvironmental variation in underlying liability, and their nonlin-ear translation into discrete observed phenotypes (Fig. 2A).Viewed most simply, each individual has an inherited addi-tive genetic value for liability, plus some set of environmentaleffects on liability that could reflect current and/or previous en-vironmental conditions (Roff 1996). These environmental effectscan be envisaged to result from liability-scale reaction norms thatshape responses to environmental variation, where reaction normslopes could show additive genetic variation (i.e., generatingG×E in liability). Indeed, the whole structure of reaction normintercepts, slopes, and covariances that acts on the observed phe-notypic scale for continuously distributed traits (Fig. 1C) can beenvisaged to similarly act on the latent liability scale for thresh-old traits (Fig. 2C). The threshold itself can then be viewed as ahigher level reaction norm (or “developmental map”) that deter-ministically translates the combined genetic and environmental196 EVOLUTION FEBRUARY 2022PERSPECTIVEFigure 2. (A) Basic concept of a threshold trait, where liability values below and above a threshold (dashed line) translate determinis-tically into discrete phenotypes ❶ and ❷ (zones of lighter and darker gray shading), respectively. This concept can be extended to traitswith multiple discrete phenotypes, given further thresholds. (B) Individuals with initial liabilities near the threshold (dark gray shading)are likely to be phenotypically plastic, whereas individuals with initial liabilities far from the threshold (light gray shading) are likely to bephenotypically canalized. Given an approximately Gaussian distribution of liabilities centered away from the threshold (white curve), themore frequently expressed phenotype will include more individuals with liabilities further from the threshold, which are therefore morelikely to be phenotypically canalized (i.e., repeatable). (C and D) Individual liabilities in relation to environmental variation (i.e., liability-scale reaction norms), comprising intercepts (red points, which can reflect outcomes of developmental plasticity in liability) and slopes(blue lines, representing labile plasticity in liability). These attributes are analogous to those for continuous phenotypic traits (Fig. 1C).Black dashed lines demarcate thresholds distinguishing expression of discrete phenotypes ❶ and ❷. Individuals with reaction normsthat cross the threshold within the observed range of environmental variation show phenotypic plasticity (solid blue lines), whereasindividuals with reaction norms that do not cross the threshold are phenotypically canalized (dotted blue lines). There might or mightnot be among-individual variation in reaction norm slopes for labile plasticity in liability, representing liability-scale G×E (C vs. D). (E)Illustration of high repeatability of both alternative phenotypes and of phenotypic plasticity. Dark, mid, and light blue points representliability values, and resulting observed phenotypes (❶ and ❷), across a timeseries (sequence of occasions) for three different individualswith different liability intercepts. All three individuals experience similar regimes of environmental variation across occasions and henceshow similar variation in liability, representing responses through similar liability-scale reaction norm slopes. Nevertheless, the light anddark blue individuals are repeatable (i.e., canalized) for phenotypes ❶ and ❷, respectively, whereas the mid blue individual is repeatablyphenotypically plastic (i.e., regularly switches between alternative phenotypes between consecutive occasions).EVOLUTION FEBRUARY 2022 197PERSPECTIVEeffects on the continuously distributed latent liability into dis-crete observed phenotypic outcomes (Fig. 2A, C; Supporting In-formation S1; Roff 1996; Lynch and Walsh 1998, Ch. 11). Thisconceptual model distinguishes plasticity occurring on the la-tent liability scale (i.e., latent plasticity) from plasticity occur-ring on the observed phenotypic scale (i.e., phenotypic plasticity;Table 1). It has multiple interesting implications for the expres-sion, form, and maintenance of phenotypic plasticity in relationto underlying genetic variation; for the consequences of selectionfor or against phenotypic plasticity; and for patterns of pheno-typic inheritance (Table 2).Key Properties of Plasticity inThreshold TraitsEXPRESSION OF PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY ANDUNDERLYING GENETIC VARIATIONIndividuals and lineages with initial liabilities (i.e., liabilityintercepts) near the threshold are more likely to be pheno-typically plastic (i.e., express different discrete phenotypes atdifferent times; Fig. 2B). This is because any subsequent smallenvironmental deviation in liability, whether due to predictableenvironmental responses shaped by liability-scale reaction normsand/or random microenvironmental deviations, is relatively likelyto push individuals across the threshold (in either direction) andhence induce expression of the alternative phenotype (Fig. 2B,C, E). In contrast, individuals and lineages with initial liabilitiesfar from the threshold (in either direction) are likely to be phe-notypically canalized, because even sizeable subsequent environ-mental deviations in liability are unlikely to induce phenotypicshifts (Fig. 2B, C, E). Substantial latent plasticity could then ex-ist in the form of liability-scale reaction norm slopes, but havezero phenotypic effect and hence be decoupled from expressionof phenotypic plasticity.Individuals’ expressions of either alternative phenotype, andof labile phenotypic plasticity (i.e., switching between discretephenotypes), can consequently be intrinsically positively corre-lated within and across time periods on different scales (e.g.,days, seasons, years). This is because individuals with liability in-tercepts far from or near to a fixed threshold on one occasion willalso have such intercepts subsequently. Sequences of small envi-ronmental deviations, or of predictable environmental changes,will consequently have phenotypic effects (or lack of effects)that are consistent across occasions within individuals. High in-dividual repeatability of expression of each discrete phenotype,alongside high individual repeatability of phenotypic plasticity,can therefore readily emerge (Fig. 2E). Population-wide repeata-bility of expression of each discrete phenotype will also be pos-itively associated with phenotype frequency, such that the mostfrequently expressed phenotype is the most highly repeatable.This is because, given the standard quantitative genetic assump-tion that the population distribution of liabilities is Gaussian, themost frequent phenotype will encompass more individuals whoseliabilities are further from the threshold and hence less likely tobe phenotypically plastic (Fig. 2B).Consequently, if there is nonzero additive genetic variationin liability intercept with a distribution of values that spans orapproaches the threshold, the basic implication is that there willbe nonzero genetic variation in expression of phenotypic plas-ticity (Fig. 2C, D). Specifically, genotypes that place an indi-vidual’s liability intercept near to or far from the threshold arelikely to effectively cause plastic and canalized phenotypes, re-spectively, given some regime of environmental variation. Re-sulting genetic variation in phenotypic plasticity does not nec-essarily require genetic variation in any reaction norm slope, orhence require nonzero G×E on the liability scale (Fig. 2D andTable 2, although such G×E could also exist, Fig. 2C). Rather,genetic and environmental effects that are straightforwardly ad-ditive on the liability intercept can induce nonadditive variationin environmental responses in observed discrete phenotypes (e.g.,Gianola 1982). This is because any particular additive genetic orenvironmental increment on liability might or might not cause achange in phenotype, or hence cause expression of phenotypicplasticity, depending on the preexisting liability value. Further,even with G×E and substantial resulting variation in linear re-action norm slopes on the latent liability scale, extreme environ-ments will not necessarily cause increased genetic variation inphenotype, and might even decrease such variation if all indi-viduals are pushed to the same side of the threshold (SupportingInformation S3).Effective genetic variation in phenotypic plasticity mightconsequently be commonplace, or even ubiquitous, in poly-morphic labile threshold traits. This is because such traits areexpected to maintain substantial additive genetic variation inliability. This in turn is because selection on genetic variantsthat do not immediately cause overall liability values to crossthe threshold (or hence cause any change in phenotype) is ex-pected to be weak, even given strong directional selection onphenotype, and especially if liability is highly polygenic (Roff1994a, 1996, 1998a,b). Intrinsic negative frequency-dependentselection on underlying genetic variants can also arise, furthercontributing to a relatively high expected mutation-selection bal-ance, alongside effects of drift in small populations (Roff 1998a).Resulting maintenance of substantial additive genetic variationhas, implicitly, been shown for liability-scale reaction norm inter-cepts (Roff 1994a, 1998a), but similar processes might also affectliability-scale reaction norm slopes. This is because considerablegenetic variation in slope could exist yet have little or no phe-notypic effect, and hence be effectively shielded from selection(Fig. 2C; Supporting Information S3).198 EVOLUTION FEBRUARY 2022PERSPECTIVEFigure 3. Potential consequences of selection (A and C) for and (B and D) against expression of labile phenotypic plasticity in a thresholdtrait for evolution of liability-scale reaction norm (A and B) intercepts and (C and D) slopes. On A and B, dark and light gray shadings indi-cate zones where individuals are likely to be phenotypically plastic or canalized, respectively. White curves depict potential distributionsof liability-scale reaction norm intercepts following strong selection (A) for and (B) against phenotypic plasticity, resulting in stabilizingand disruptive selection on intercept, respectively. On C and D, phenotypic plasticity occurs when an individual’s liability-scale reactionnorm crosses the threshold (black dashed line), causing changed expression of phenotype ❶ versus ❷ (darker vs. lighter gray zones).Reaction norm intercepts and slopes (depicted by red points and blue lines) could become (C) negatively or (D) positively correlated dueto selection for or against phenotypic plasticity. Intercepts might in turn be shaped by the intercept and slope of the reaction norm fordevelopmental plasticity, and reaction norms for labile and/or developmental plasticity could also be nonlinear.Given some regime of stochastic and/or predictable environ-mental variation, populations could therefore readily comprisemixtures of highly phenotypically plastic and highly canalizedindividuals (Fig. 2C, D, E; Table 2). No further explanations,such as negative frequency-dependent selection on expression ofplasticity coupled with positive feedbacks that reduce expressioncosts (Wolf et al. 2008; Wolf and Weissing 2010), or complexmechanisms driving evolution of multiple distinct tactics (En-gqvist and Taborsky 2016), are necessarily required (Hazel et al.2004, although such effects could additionally apply). Hence,although cross-environment phenotypic canalization of contin-uously distributed traits effectively requires fixation of geneticvariants that reduce reaction norm slopes and make traits robustto environmental variation (Ehrenreich and Pfennig 2016), suchfixation is not required to generate a highly phenotypically canal-ized threshold trait. Co-existence of canalized and phenotypicplastic individuals, and transitions between apparent canalizationand plasticity given environmental changes, is consequently rela-tively straightforward to explain at both population and individuallevels, and could rapidly occur without need for complex mecha-nisms or substantial mutation or gene flow.SELECTIONThe occurrence of directional selection for or against expressionof labile phenotypic plasticity in a threshold trait (i.e., higher orlower fitness in individuals that sequentially express both alter-native phenotypes) could imply that individuals with liability in-tercepts close to the threshold have higher or lower fitness, re-spectively, than individuals with liability intercepts further away.Directional selection for or against phenotypic plasticity couldconsequently induce stabilizing or disruptive selection on liabil-ity intercept if the distribution of liabilities substantially spansthe threshold (Fig. 3A, B), or directional selection if the distribu-tion only marginally spans the threshold. The form of selectionon liability induced by selection on phenotypic plasticity couldtherefore depend on the liability distribution and hence changewith the progress of evolution, even if the form of selection onexpression of phenotypic plasticity does not change at all.EVOLUTION FEBRUARY 2022 199PERSPECTIVEEras of directional selection on phenotypic plasticity thatcause directional, stabilizing, or disruptive selection on the lia-bility intercept could then, respectively, reduce additive geneticvariation, or increase additive genetic variation and even generatebimodal distributions (Fig. 3A, B). Unlike with continuously dis-tributed traits, evolution of phenotypic plasticity (whether devel-opmental and/or labile) could then proceed solely through evo-lution of distributions of reaction norm intercepts, irrespective ofslopes (Table 2).But, complex forms of liability-scale G×E that facilitate orprevent expression of phenotypic plasticity could also conceiv-ably evolve. For example, individuals with liability interceptsclose to or far from the threshold could in principle have liabil-ities that are differentially sensitive to environmental variation,implying evolution of some form of intercept-slope covariancefor the liability-scale reaction norm (Fig. 3C, D). Directional se-lection for or against expression of phenotypic plasticity couldtherefore potentially generate nonzero liability-scale G×E ratherthan eradicate it, which is opposite to basic expectations for con-tinuously distributed traits (Fig. 1D; Table 2). The presence ofnonzero liability-scale G×E could then serve to prevent expres-sion of phenotypic plasticity rather than necessarily define varia-tion in its presence.Because the intercept of the overall individual liability-scale reaction norm could depend on the form of developmentalplasticity (Fig. 2C), such outcomes will depend on the full quanti-tative genetic architecture of the liability-scale G-matrix, includ-ing genetic covariances between reaction norm slopes for de-velopmental versus labile plasticity. Evolution of such complexliability-scale quantitative genetic architectures (Fig. 3) wouldlikely require consistently strong selection for or against phe-notypic plasticity. But such selection might be expected to bestronger for labile threshold traits than for continuously dis-tributed traits, because there could be substantial induced and/orconstitutive costs, or benefits, associated with switching betweenalternative phenotypic states.PHENOTYPIC INHERITANCEThreshold traits could also generate distinctive patterns of ap-parent inheritance of phenotypic plasticity or canalization, man-ifested as parent-offspring resemblance (Table 2). Such patternscould arise because the threshold trait structure translates addi-tive genetic effects on liability into nonadditive genotypic effectson observed phenotypes (Gianola 1982; Lynch and Walsh 1998,Ch. 25).Specifically, reproduction between parents with differenthighly canalized discrete phenotypes, resulting from liability in-tercepts far from the threshold on opposite sides, could read-ily generate highly phenotypically plastic offspring. This is be-cause resulting offsprings’ liability intercepts could be close tothe threshold, meaning that their phenotypes change in responseto any small environmental deviation. Maintenance (or elimina-tion) of phenotypic plasticity will therefore partly depend on thedegree of assortative (or disassortative) mating with respect tocanalized parental phenotypes. If both alternative phenotypes areexpressed in a population, then phenotypic plasticity could behard to eradicate, even given very strong selection against it, un-less there is strong assortative mating. Equally, given standard in-heritance of liability with Mendelian sampling variance (reflect-ing segregation and recombination), it could be hard to eradicateexpression of both (relatively) canalized phenotypes even givenstrong selection for phenotypic plasticity. Genetic variation forplasticity (and for canalization) in threshold traits is consequentlyunlikely to be purged as readily as could be the case for continu-ously distributed traits (e.g., van Buskirk and Steiner 2009; Saltzet al. 2018). Rather, selection for or against phenotypic plasticitycould potentially drive indirect selection on the mating system,where optimal mate choice given any regime of selection on plas-ticity could depend on the degree of phenotypic plasticity of anyfocal individual.Finally, if females and males have different mean liabilityintercepts and hence show different phenotype frequencies (i.e.,phenotypic sexual dimorphism), then deceptive patterns of phe-notypic variation could arise, which could be incorrectly inter-preted to imply sex-specific genetic architectures or other causesof phenotypic variation (e.g., Lynch and Walsh 1998, Ch. 25).For example, individuals of whichever sex has mean liability in-tercept closer to the threshold could be more phenotypically plas-tic, even without any sex-specific effects on liability-scale reac-tion norm slopes. Evidence of apparent sex-specific genetic dom-inance reversals at large-effect loci could also arise, even in theabsence of any strict dominance reversals. This is because geneticeffects that are purely additive on the liability scale, and identi-cal in both sexes, can become nonadditive on the observed phe-notypic scale, with forms that differ between the sexes if meanliabilities differ (Supporting Information S4).DiscussionThe potential for threshold traits to show distinctive propertiesof phenotypic plasticity compared to traits that are continuouslydistributed on observed phenotypic scales, including differingpatterns of expression, genetic variation, selection, and apparentinheritance, has numerous implications for rationalizing and pre-dicting phenotypic, population, and evolutionary dynamics in thecontexts of environmental variation and change. Core premisesof theory concerning continuously distributed traits include thatgenetic variation in phenotypic plasticity equates to genetic vari-ation in reaction norm slopes, representing G×E; that directionalselection for or against plasticity will cause evolutionary changes200 EVOLUTION FEBRUARY 2022PERSPECTIVEthat respectively increase or decrease reaction norm slopes; thatfixation of phenotypic canalization or of some degree of plasticityimplies erosion of G×E; and that observed degrees of plasticityare directly inherited following standard (additive) quantitativegenetic expectations (Table 2). Such properties underpin mathe-matical and verbal explorations of how combinations of plasticityand microevolution can allow mean values of continuously dis-tributed traits to rematch changing environmentally determinedoptima, and thereby “rescue” declining populations by restoringthe previous ecological status quo (Nussey et al. 2007; Lande2009; Ashander et al. 2016; Chevin and Hoffmann 2017; Arnoldet al. 2019a; Kelly 2019). But such properties and outcomes donot necessarily apply to threshold traits, where inherited reactionnorms are postulated to act on latent liability scales.For such traits, genetic variation in phenotypic plas-ticity does not necessarily require genetic variation inliability-scale reaction norm slopes; evolution of the degree ofphenotypic plasticity could potentially occur through changingintercepts rather than necessarily slopes; strong directional selec-tion on phenotypic plasticity could conceivably generate ratherthan erode complex forms of liability-scale G×E; and substan-tial phenotypic plasticity could readily re-emerge in offspringof highly phenotypically canalized parents, generating persistentpopulation-wide variation in plasticity (Table 2). New theory willconsequently be required to rationalize and predict joint pheno-typic, population, and evolutionary dynamics involving plasticthreshold traits, and thereby discern how such traits could act torescue populations through flexible switching between alterna-tive phenotypic and ecological states rather than by restoring thestatus quo.Some progress can be achieved through mathematical the-ory, aiming to formalize basic principles that are currently out-lined verbally (Table 2) and identify conditions under which theyapply (e.g., Hazel et al. 2004). For example, population frequen-cies of phenotypically plastic versus canalized individuals, andresulting opportunities for selection, will presumably depend onrelative magnitudes of additive genetic means and (co)variancesin liability-scale reaction norm intercepts and slopes alongsidemicroenvironmental variances. Evolved intercepts and slopes,and resulting environmental variances, will in turn affect the im-pact of selection and the consequent maintenance of (cryptic) ge-netic variation. However, the fact that existing evolutionary the-ory involving plasticity explicitly focuses on linear phenotypicreaction norms to facilitate mathematical tractability (e.g., Lande2009, 2019; Ashander et al. 2016) implies that dynamics involv-ing threshold traits will be less readily tractable. Advances mayconsequently require numerical or individual-based simulations,which can more readily encompass key features such as intrin-sically dynamic impacts of selection and genetic (co)variancesin relation to phenotype frequencies, and dependence of plastic-ity on forms of assortative mating. Simulations have previouslybeen used to examine basic properties of threshold traits, such asthe maintenance of substantial additive genetic variation in liabil-ity through selection-mutation-drift balance despite strong direc-tional selection (Roff 1998a), evolution of threshold traits fromcontinuously varying traits (Chevin and Lande 2013), and inter-acting effects of indirect selection, environmental variation, andassortative mating (de Zoeten and Pulido 2020). However, suchapproaches have not yet been applied to explicitly consider evo-lutionary dynamics of threshold trait plasticity.APPLICABILITY OF THE THRESHOLD TRAIT MODELJustification for developing theory for dynamic threshold traitsrequires that key traits that show discrete alternative phenotypesdo reasonably conform to the threshold trait model. Although la-tent liabilities cannot, by definition, be directly observed, the ba-sic adequacy of the threshold trait model has been well demon-strated through quantitative genetics studies based in animalbreeding and medicine, alongside experiments in evolutionary bi-ology, which show that observed patterns of phenotypic variationand microevolution concur with theoretical predictions (Gianola1982; Roff 1994b, 1996; Falconer and Mackay 1996; Lynch andWalsh 1998). However, such work has predominantly focusedon initial development, not on labile phenotypic plasticity (butsee Negussie et al. 2012). Formalizing theory and predictions forlabile plasticity could therefore provide opportunities to evalu-ate the applicability of the threshold model to dynamic discretetraits in wild populations, and highlight pertinent parameters thatneed to be estimated. Such theory could then provide relativelystraightforward explanations for complex observed patterns ofphenotypic variation that are otherwise puzzling or require somespecific or idiosyncratic explanation.As one broad example, dichotomous expression of seasonalmigration versus year-round residence in partially migratorysystems is a critical trait in the context of understanding popula-tion responses to environmental variation and change. Here, anychange in phenotype frequencies, whether due to microevolution,plasticity, and/or microevolution of plasticity, will directly alterseasonal population dynamics and distributions (Reid et al.2018). Migration versus residence has long been conceptualizedas a threshold trait, underpinned by combinations of geneticand environmental effects (Berthold 1988; Pulido 2011; Dodsonet al. 2013). Classic work on blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) usedbreeding designs and artificial selection to show that liability formigration (as expressed in captivity) is highly heritable and posi-tively genetically correlated with measures of migratory activity,and hence that phenotypic expression of migration or residencecould be rapidly eliminated and regained (Berthold 1988; Pulidoet al. 1996; Pulido 2011; de Zoeten and Pulido 2020). Recentanalyses of partially migratory European shags (PhalacrocoraxEVOLUTION FEBRUARY 2022 201PERSPECTIVEaristotelis) revealed patterns of among-individual and within-individual phenotypic variation (i.e., labile plasticity) that arealso highly consistent with verbal predictions from the thresholdtrait model. Specifically, focal populations comprise mixturesof individuals that are nonbreeding season migrants or residents(representing two alternative phenotypes), alongside individualsthat switch between resident and migrant states partway throughthe nonbreeding season, which can be viewed as expressingwithin-season phenotypic plasticity (Reid et al. 2020). Highbetween-year repeatability is evident, such that individuals thatmigrate, remain resident, or switch within one nonbreedingseason are highly likely to do the same again in subsequentnonbreeding seasons, with the expected positive associationsbetween phenotype frequency and repeatability (Reid et al.2020; Acker et al. unpubl. ms.). Yet, between-year plasticityalso occurs and is correlated with within-season plasticity, suchthat individuals that switch between residence and migrationwithin any one nonbreeding season are more likely to switch toresidence or full-season migration in subsequent nonbreedingseasons. This concurs with the expected correlation in plasticityacross temporal scales (Acker et al. unpubl. ms.). These analysesalso revealed episodes of selection for or against within-seasonplasticity that varied substantially among years in relation toenvironmental conditions. Such fluctuating selection impliesvariable costs of plasticity, and resulting episodes of directional,stabilizing, and disruptive selection on underlying liability (Reidet al. 2020; Acker et al. unpubl. ms.).Other partially migratory systems also show mixtures ofphenotypically canalized and plastic residents and migrants, withdifferent levels of individual variation and repeatability acrosstimescales, for example, regarding diel feeding movements inburbot (Lota lota, Harrison et al. 2017), and seasonal migrationversus residence in roach (Rutilus rutilus, Brodersen et al. 2014).Such patterns are commonly discussed in the broad context of thethreshold trait model (e.g., Dodson et al. 2013), but not explic-itly tested against qualitative or quantitative predictions. For ex-ample, resident elk (Cervus elaphus) were more likely to switchto migration across years than vice versa in a population whereresidence was the more frequent tactic, and some individualsswitched repeatedly (Eggeman et al. 2016). These patterns con-cur with expectations given the threshold trait model, yet werenot explicitly considered in that context.Further, apparent nonadditive genotypic effects on migration(and associated age at reproductive maturity) have been docu-mented in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), and interpreted as sex-specific genetic dominance reversals at a large-effect locus thatserve to resolve sexual conflict (Barson et al. 2015; Czorlichet al. 2018). However, because migration timing shows substan-tial sexual dimorphism, similar patterns of phenotypic variationcould readily arise given a predominantly quantitative geneticthreshold trait with sex-specific mean liability intercepts and sex-independent co-dominance at the large-effect locus, and hencewithout requiring any explicit sex-specific dominance reversal(Supporting Information S4). Finally, although assortative mat-ing has been suggested to facilitate evolution of distinct migra-tory types within sympatric breeding populations (Bearhop et al.2005; de Zoeten and Pulido 2020), the implication that such mat-ing could reduce phenotypic plasticity in offspring has not beendiscussed. There is consequently considerable scope for tighterquantitative interpretation, or re-interpretation, of diverse empir-ical results in the context of the threshold trait model, regardingseasonal migration, and regarding numerous other labile dichoto-mous traits.ESTIMATION OF KEY PARAMETERSGiven that observed patterns of phenotypic variation broadly con-form to expectations for threshold traits, the next challenge isto explicitly estimate key quantitative genetic parameters com-prising additive genetic (co)variances in intercepts and slopesof liability-scale reaction norms. Such estimates have sometimesbeen obtained by considering other relevant and directly observ-able continuously distributed phenotypic traits as proxies of the(unobserved) liability. For example, juvenile hormone titers havebeen interpreted as liability to develop winged versus winglessforms in hemimetabolous insects (Roff 1994b), and body size hasbeen interpreted as liability to produce particular morphologicalforms or enact particular reproductive strategies in fish (Dodsonet al. 2013). However, such observable proxy traits are unlikely tosimply equate to liability, and are best viewed as additional traitsthat could be genetically correlated with liability (Roff and Fair-bairn 2007; Debes et al. 2020). In general, such correlated traitscould induce or constrain multivariate evolution, including evo-lution of overall plasticity (e.g., Lande 2019). Resulting indirectselection on threshold trait liabilities could have particularly im-portant effects, by effectively exposing otherwise cryptic geneticvariation to selection (e.g., de Zoeten and Pulido 2020).Indeed, it is not necessary to measure any observable proxytrait to infer key quantitative genetic parameters for the latent li-ability underlying a threshold trait (Falconer and Mackay 1996).Rather, parameters representing liability-scale reaction norm in-tercepts and slopes can in principle be directly estimated givenobservations of dichotomous phenotypes expressed by relativesacross environments. This can be achieved by using statisticalmachinery that is now well established in the form of general-ized linear mixed models (de Villemereuil et al. 2016). Here, aspecified function links observations of discrete phenotypes tounderlying latent values, which could in turn be modeled as anyfunction (i.e., reaction norm) of environmental variables or othercovariates of interest. Such formulations of the threshold traitmodel are well established in statistical and quantitative genetics202 EVOLUTION FEBRUARY 2022PERSPECTIVEtheory, and are explicitly enacted using a probit link (i.e., repre-senting an inverse cumulative normal distribution, Gianola 1982;Hadfield 2015; de Villemereuil et al. 2016; Germain et al. 2018;Debes et al. 2020). Yet, the implications and interpretations ofsuch analyses for concepts of latent versus phenotypic plasticityare still surprisingly infrequently explicitly discussed.Rather, evolutionary ecologists interested in environment-dependent expression of dichotomous traits have reformulatedthe standard threshold trait model into the “(latent) environmen-tal threshold model” (Hazel et al. 2004; Tomkins and Hazel 2007;Pulido 2011; Buoro et al. 2012; Buzatto et al. 2015). Here, thefocal evolving trait is defined as the point on some known envi-ronmental axis (or “cue”) at which each individual or lineage’sphenotype changes state, envisaged as a genetically controlledthreshold value. Hence, in contrast to the standard threshold traitmodel, the environmental threshold model assumes that the en-vironmental axis exerts equal effects across individuals and lin-eages, whereas the threshold value can show additive geneticvariation and evolve (Tomkins and Hazel 2007; Buoro et al. 2012;Buzatto et al. 2015). The standard threshold trait model and theenvironmental threshold model are equivalent (i.e., reparameter-izations of the same conceptual model) in the special case wherethere is zero liability-scale G×E given the standard thresholdmodel, and hence a cross-environment genetic correlation of 1(i.e., zero variation in latent plasticity, Roff 1994b; Hazel et al.2004; Tomkins and Hazel 2007). The point at which an indi-vidual or lineage’s liability crosses the fixed threshold (i.e., itsobserved threshold value) is then directly related to its liabilityintercept (e.g., Fig. 2D). Consequently, the environmental thresh-old model formulation has motivated empirical investigations ofwhether the condition of zero G×E in liability (or in some proxytrait) is approximately valid (Roff 1994b).However, if one ambition is to rationalize and predict evo-lutionary dynamics of plasticity, then it seems highly restrictiveto formulate analyses and conceptual developments through amodel that assumes zero liability-scale G×E. In fact, there isno need to make such an assumption, which arises because theenvironmental threshold model considers environmental and ge-netic effects on separate orthogonal axes of cues versus thresh-olds. This structure can be eliminated by considering joint geneticand environmental effects on the same latent liability, by for-mulating liability-scale reaction norms that could include G×E(Fig. 2C). Indeed, the possibility of both environmental and ge-netic effects on liability was already fully embedded in the origi-nal quantitative genetic threshold trait model, for example, yield-ing theory on heritability on latent liability (and observed phe-notypic) scales (Dempster and Lerner 1950; Lynch and Walsh1998, Ch. 25). Here, the heritability represents the ratio of ge-netic to total variance, and the total variance typically includesa substantial component of environmental variance (Roff 1996).Formulation of a distinct (latent) environmental threshold modelis consequently not really necessary, and has invoked additionalrestrictive assumptions (Roff 1994b; Hadfield 2015). Meanwhile,some articles that are phrased in terms of the environmentalthreshold model in fact approximately implement the standardthreshold model, including interacting latent-scale genetic andenvironmental effects (e.g., Ostrowski et al. 2000).INTERPRETATIONS AND IMPLICATIONSGiven that intrinsic properties of phenotypic plasticity and plas-ticity evolution could differ markedly between threshold traitsand continuously distributed traits (Table 2), it becomes im-portant that traits of biological interest are not misconceptual-ized (e.g., true threshold traits treated as continuously distributedtraits), at least without considering the implications of such con-versions. It might seem implausible that true discrete and con-tinuous traits could be confused or interchanged. However, givenlabile phenotypic plasticity, the distinction between the two maynot always be clear and may be a matter of biological interpreta-tion.For example, the seasonal timing of key life-history events,such as breeding, is now a major focus for theoretical and em-pirical work on plasticity and evolutionary dynamics in relationto environmental change (Nussey et al. 2007; Lof et al. 2012; In-ouye et al. 2019; Radchuk et al. 2019). Here, the focal trait iscommonly defined, measured, and analyzed as the observed dateof event (e.g., egg laying in birds, parturition in mammals, flower-ing date in plants), which is continuously distributed (e.g., Arnoldet al. 2019a,b; Inouye et al. 2019; de Villemereuil et al. 2020).However, biologically, these observed events represent the dateson which individuals switch between approximately discrete phe-notypic states (e.g., “nonbreeding” and “breeding”). They couldconsequently be viewed as manifestations of a threshold trait withlabile plasticity, where most or all individuals cross the thresholdfor reproduction at some point during a season. Quantitative ge-netic analyses that treat observed date as the focal trait are theneffectively using the environmental threshold model, implicitlyinvoking the assumption of zero liability-scale G×E. This couldhinder appropriate evolutionary inference, especially when theobjective in studying breeding date is to test for, or evaluate theimplications of, nonzero G×E (e.g., Nussey et al. 2007; Char-mantier and Gienapp 2014). Further, “date” is unlikely to be theprimary driving environmental variable; indeed mean breedingdates commonly vary substantially among years, implying thatliability-scale reaction norms shaping the transition to breedingrespond to other environmental variable(s) (e.g., Lof et al. 2012;Inouye et al. 2019; de Villemereuil et al. 2020). Microevolution-ary analyses that treat observed event dates as continuously dis-tributed traits, if in fact the true underlying biology is a thresholdtrait with labile plasticity, might consequently give incompleteEVOLUTION FEBRUARY 2022 203PERSPECTIVEor erroneous predictions of evolutionary dynamics, at least undersome circumstances. Indeed, breeding dates often do not showexpected microevolutionary responses to observed directional se-lection, which has been suggested to reflect additional environ-mental or genetic constraints (de Villemereuil et al. 2020). Yet,although studying phenology in terms of time to event and associ-ated reaction norms rather than simply observed events has beenadvocated (Gienapp et al. 2005; Inouye et al. 2019), the meritsand practicalities of treating events as manifestations of a plasticthreshold trait have scarcely been explicitly considered.Overall, therefore, future empirical ambitions should be tofully exploit recent conceptual and empirical developments inevolutionary quantitative genetics to explicitly estimate key pa-rameters defining liability-scale reaction norms and resulting ex-pression of threshold traits, and estimate genetic covariances withother traits and components of fitness. Such analyses will requiresubstantial data on discrete phenotypes of relatives and nonrel-atives distributed across representative environments, and willtherefore require appropriate multivariate axes of environmen-tal variation driving developmental and/or labile plasticity to bemeasured or imposed. Such advances will be challenging, but willbe necessary to predict how complex dynamics of discrete traitscan drive phenotypic, population, and evolutionary responses toenvironmental variation and directional change.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSJMR conceptualized and wrote the manuscript, with substantial concep-tual and editing input from PA.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank Y.

phenotypic plasticity hypothesis,217320459,Phenotypic Plasticity: Molecular Mechanisms and Adaptive Significance,10.1002/cphy.c110008,"Kelly, Scott, Panhuis, Tami, Stoehr, Andrew",2012,"Phenotypic plasticity can be broadly defined as the ability of one genotype to produce more than one phenotype when exposed to different environments, as the modification of developmental events by the environment, or as the ability of an individual organism to alter its phenotype in response to changes in environmental conditions. Not surprisingly, the study of phenotypic plasticity is innately interdisciplinary and encompasses aspects of behavior, development, ecology, evolution, genetics, genomics, and multiple physiological systems at various levels of biological organization. From an ecological and evolutionary perspective, phenotypic plasticity may be a powerful means of adaptation and dramatic examples of phenotypic plasticity include predator avoidance, insect wing polymorphisms, the timing of metamorphosis in amphibians, osmoregulation in fishes, and alternative reproductive tactics in male vertebrates. From a human health perspective, documented examples of plasticity most commonly include the results of exercise, training, and/or dieting on human morphology and physiology. Regardless of the discipline, phenotypic plasticity has increasingly become the target of a plethora of investigations with the methodological approaches utilized ranging from the molecular to whole organsimal. In this article, we provide a brief historical outlook on phenotypic plasticity; examine its potential adaptive significance; emphasize recent molecular approaches that provide novel insight into underlying mechanisms, and highlight examples in fishes and insects. Finally, we highlight examples of phenotypic plasticity from a human health perspective and underscore the use of mouse models as a powerful tool in understanding the genetic architecture of phenotypic plasticity",,text,,,'Wiley'
phenotypic plasticity hypothesis,100033243,"Phenotypic Plasticity and Robustness: Evolutionary Stability Theory, Gene Expression Dynamics Model, and Laboratory Experiments",,"Kunihiko Kaneko, Kunihiko Kaneko",2014,"Abstract Plasticity and robustness, which are two basic concepts in the evolution of developmental dynamics, are characterized in terms of the variance of phenotype distribution. Plasticity concerns the response of a phenotype against environmental and genetic changes, whereas robustness is the phenotypefs degree of insensitivity against such changes. Note that the sensitivity increases with the variance, and the inverse of the variance works as a measure of the robustness. First, it is found that the response ratio is proportional to the phenotype variance, as described by ex-tending the fluctuation-response relationship in statistical physics. Next, it is shown that through the course of robust evolution, the phenotype variance caused by ge-netic change decreases in proportion to that by noise during the developmental pro-cess. This evolution, resulting in increased robustness, is achieved only when the noise in the developmental process is sufficiently large; in other words, robustness to noise leads to robustness to mutation. For a system that achieves robustness in the phenotype, it is also found that the proportionality between the two variances also holds across different phenotypic traits. These general relationships for plas-ticity and robustness in terms of fluctuations are demonstrated using macroscopic phenomenological theory, simulations of gene expression dynamics models with regulation networks, and laboratory selection experiments. It is also shown that an optimal noise level compatibility between robustness and plasticity is achieved to cope with a fluctuating environment",,text,"Key Words, fluctuation, noise, canalization, error catastrophe, artificial selection",,
phenotypic plasticity hypothesis,80083011,Phenotypic plasticity: From microevolution to macroevolution,10.1007/978-94-017-9014-7_14,"Nicoglou, Antonine",2014,"International audienceThis chapter starts with a short history of the concept of phenotypic plasticity (from the seventeenth century to present) in order to distinguish two distinct conceptions of plasticity: one more dynamic (or Aristotelian) according to which the notion has been described as a property inherent to life whose very organization depends upon it, and an other conception, more passive, according to which """" plasticity """" means the capacity to express different phenotypes for a single genotype depending on environmental conditions. The chapter shows then how Darwinian theories have first favored the second conception, before the emergence of a renewed interest for the first one, which plays the role of an explanans, while the second conception would rather be an explanandum. In so doing, the chapter describes in depth the role of the concept in micro-and macroevolution study. The concept of plasticity is everywhere in the life sciences. As in philosophy, 1 the term can have two meanings: in the active sense, the concept of plasticity is synonymous with """" that which has the power to shape or form """" with the example in biology being the egg cell development, which has the plastic capacity to generate a mul-ti-celled organism; in the passive sense, the concept expresses a """" susceptibility to take on an indefinite number of forms """" , with the example in evolutionary biology being """" phenotypic plasticity """" , which we will define here as an organisms' capacity to express different phenotypes of a single genotype as a function of environmental conditions.

phenotypic plasticity hypothesis,265566878,Plastic responses to novel environments are biasedtowards phenotype dimensions with high additivegenetic variation,10.1073/pnas.1821066116,"Noble, Daniel WA, Radersma, Reinder, Uller, Tobias",2019,"Environmentally induced phenotypes have been proposed to initiate and bias adaptive evolutionary change toward particular directions. The potential for this to happen depends in part on how well plastic responses are aligned with the additive genetic variance and covariance in traits. Using meta-analysis, we demonstrate that plastic responses to novel environments tend to occur along phenotype dimensions that harbor substantial amounts of additive genetic variation. This suggests that selection for or against environmentally induced phenotypes typically will be effective. One interpretation of the alignment between the direction of plasticity and the main axis of additive genetic variation is that developmental systems tend to respond to environmental novelty as they do to genetic mutation. This makes it challenging to distinguish if the direction of evolution is biased by plasticity or genetic “constraint.” Our results therefore highlight a need for new theoretical and empirical approaches to address the role of plasticity in evolution.This study was funded by a grant from the John Templeton Foundation (60501) and a Wallenberg Academy Fellowship (both to T.U.).

phenotypic plasticity hypothesis,234291939,Data from: A history of phenotypic plasticity accelerates adaptation to a new environment,10.5061/dryad.58pq3,"Fierst, Janna L",2011,"Can a history of phenotypic plasticity increase the rate of adaptation to a new environment? Theory suggests it can through two different mechanisms. Phenotypically plastic organisms can adapt rapidly to new environments through genetic assimilation, or the fluctuating environments that result in phenotypic plasticity can produce evolvable genetic architectures. In this article, I studied a model of a gene regulatory network that determined a phenotypic character in one population selected for phenotypic plasticity and a second population in a constant environment. A history of phenotypic plasticity increased the rate of adaptation in a new environment, but the amount of this increase was dependent on the strength of selection in the original environment. Phenotypic variance in the original environment predicted the adaptive capacity of the trait within, but not between, plastic and non-plastic populations. These results have implications for invasive species, and ecological studies of rapid adaptation",,Article,,,
phenotypic plasticity hypothesis,584475406,Environmental change and the rate of phenotypic plasticity,10.5061/dryad.tdz08kq2d,"Burton, Tim, Ratikainen, Irja Ida, Einum, Sigurd",2022,"With rapid and less predictable environmental change emerging as the 'new norm', understanding how individuals tolerate environmental stress via plastic, often reversible changes to the phenotype (i.e. reversible phenotypic plasticity, RPP) remains a key issue in ecology. Here, we examine the potential for better understanding how organisms overcome environmental challenges within their own lifetimes by scrutinizing a somewhat overlooked aspect of RPP, namely the rate at which it can occur. Whilst recent advances in the field provide indication of the aspects of environmental change where RPP rates may be of particular ecological relevance, we observe that current theoretical models do not consider the evolutionary potential of the rate of RPP. Although, recent theory underscores the importance of environmental predictability in determining the slope of the evolved reaction norm for a given trait (i.e. how much plasticity can occur), a hitherto neglected possibility is that the rate of plasticity might be a more dynamic component of this relationship than previously assumed.  If the rate of plasticity itself can evolve, as empirical evidence foreshadows rates of plasticity may have the potential to alter the level predictability in the environment as perceived by the organism and thus influence the slope of the evolved reaction norm. However, optimality in the rate of phenotypic plasticity, its evolutionary dynamics in different environments and influence of constraints imposed by associated costs remain unexplored and may represent fruitful avenues of exploration in future theoretical and empirical treatments of the topic. We conclude by reviewing published studies of RPP rates, providing suggestions for improving the measurement of RPP rates, both in terms of experimental design and in the statistical quantification of this component of plasticity.Funding provided by: Norges ForskningsrådCrossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416Award Number: 244046Funding provided by: Norges ForskningsrådCrossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416Award Number: 223257/F50Funding provided by: Norsk institutt for naturforskningCrossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100019715Award Number:The data contained in this dataset was obtained from a literature search performed in December 2021. To identify published empirical research focusing on the rate of phenotypic plasticity, we entered the search terms in Web of Science: (ALL= (""""acclimation"""" or """"phenotypic plasticity"""") AND ALL = (""""time-course*"""" or """"time-scale*"""" or """"time-period*"""" or """"response-time*"""")). We opted to exclude the word """"rate"""" from this search due to the high number of false results that were returned in preliminary trials. This initial search yielded 885 papers. We then scanned the title and abstract (if available) of these papers, excluding cases where it could be determined unambiguously that the rate of plasticity was not a focus of the study. This reduced the initial list to 276 papers. Due to time constraints, we excluded studies where the full text version of the paper could not be located online (n = 16) and then scanned the text of each of the remaining papers, omitting those that (i) were review articles, (ii) implemented a gradual (rather than acute) change in the environmental variable under manipulation, (iii) were performed in field conditions, (iv) did not contain data showing a time-course of change in the phenotypic variable(s) of interest and (v) implemented only a transient treatment exposure to the environmental variable of interest (e.g. heat shock experiments).From each of the 170 papers, we then extracted data for the variables listed below. The abbreviated name used in the data file contained in this dataset is stated in parentheses, along with a brief description of the values each variable could assume: year of publication (year: integer), taxonomic group (taxon.group: categorical - plant/animal/bacteria), species name (species: character), environmental variable subject to manipulation (env.var: character), phenotypic trait(s) measured (trait: character), the acclimation status of the control groups (acc.type.control: categorical - initial-environment/initial- and new-environment/none), number of phenotypic measurements made during time-course of acclimation to new environment (timepoints.treatment: integer), statistical quantification of the rate of plasticity (rate.quant: categorical - yes/no), reference (ref: character). Exploration of the extracted data revealed a high diversity of phenotypic traits. To aid quantitative interpretation, each of the recorded traits was placed into one of 7 categories. Where a given grouping maybe ambiguous, we list several illustrative examples below. The categories were:  life history (e.g. body size, population growth rate), behaviour (e.g. prey search time, swimming speed), thermal tolerance (e.g. CTmin, heat knockdown time), morphological (e.g. body shape, leaf thickness), gene expression (e.g. mRNA level associated with a given gene), bioenergetic (e.g. traits involved in photosynthesis, respiration or energy conversion) and biochemical (e.g. enzyme activities, fluid osmolality, fluid ion concentration). Likewise, a high diversity of environmental variables was also evident in the extracted data. We thus categorized these variables into 13 groups. Again, where there may be potential for ambiguity in a given grouping, we list several examples. The 13 groups were:  pH, carbon dioxide concentration, oxygen concentration, population density, water availability, temperature, predation (e.g. predator kairomones), nutrition (e.g. food quantity, food quality or nitrogen availability), chemical exposure (e.g. exposure to copper or aluminum ions), light (e.g. light intensity, level of UV radiation) and salinity (i.e. salt concentration). Two final groups that require further explanation are physical environment (e.g. water flow, background color) which includes aspects of the physical environment not covered by any of the previous groupings, and a group we termed interaction to describe instances where two environmental variables were subject to simultaneous experimental manipulation (e.g. temperature × food availability). This variable is termed env.var.category (character variable)",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/other, dataset","phenotypic plasticity, acclimation, time-scale of plasticity, plasticity rate, acclimation rate, acclimation time-course, rapid environmental change",,

Interaction between these nonexclusive mechanisms must be considered if we are to understand population survival. This review discusses the ways in which plasticity and selection can interact, based on a review of the literature on selection and phenotypic plasticity in the evolution of populations. The link between selection and phenotypic plasticity is analysed at the level of the individual. Plasticity can affect an individual's response to selection and so may modify the end result of genetic diversity evolution at population level. Genetic diversity increases the ability of populations or communities to adapt to new environmental conditions. Adaptive plasticity increases individual fitness. However this effect must be viewed from the perspective of the costs of plasticity, although these are not easy to estimate. It is becoming necessary to engage in new experimental research to demonstrate the combined effects of selection and plasticity for adaptation and their consequences on the evolution of genetic diversity",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/article, Journal articles","phenotypic plasticity, mécanisme d'adaptation, plasticité phénotypique, évolution de la population, sélection végétale, adaptation au changement, [SDV.SA]Life Sciences [q-bio]/Agricultural sciences",,Hindawi

Phenotypic plasticity is a mechanism of trait variation that determines how individuals and populations adapt to changing and novel environments. For individuals, the ef- fects of phenotypic plasticity can be quantified by measuring environment–trait relationships, but it is often difficult to predict how phenotypic plasticity affects populations. The assumption that environment–trait relationships validated for in- dividuals indicate how populations respond to environmental change is commonly made without sufficient justification.

Phenotypic plasticity is the ability of indi- vidual genotypes to produce different phenotypes when exposed to different environmental conditions (Fusco & Minelli, 2010) and has been shown to be a mechanism by which species respond to climate change (Boutin & Lane, 2014; Crozier & Hutchings, 2014; Seebacher et al., 2015; Stoks et al., 2014). There is evidence that species exhibit- ing high levels of phenotypic plasticity are more success- ful at spreading across environmental gradients (Hahn et al., 2012; Szabó et al., 2018), and it is predicted that phenotypic plasticity contributes to determining the out- come of interspecific competition (Buskirk & Mccollum, 2016; Palkovacs & Post, 2009). Quantifying phenotypic plasticity in individuals is generally straightforward, but it is often more difficult to measure the effects on popu- lations (Merilä & Hendry, 2014; Valladares et al., 2006).

Environment, E  the occurrence of seemingly paradoxical population dy- namical behaviours such as the paradox of enrichment, whereby an increase in available resources causes a desta- bilisation of population's dynamics (Miner et al., 2005), and the hydra effect where an increase in per capita mor- tality results in increased population density (Cameron & Benton, 2004). Disentangling  the  complex  network of inter-dependent individual and population processes necessary to demonstrate how phenotypic plasticity con- tributes to  species  responses  to  environmental  change is inherently difficult using existing model frameworks (Forsman, 2015). In particular, the population dynamic consequences of phenotypic plasticity often manifest as delayed-density dependence (Beckerman et al., 2002) which is known to cause cryptic dynamical behaviours (Lima et al., 1999; Pedraza-Garcia & Cubillos, 2008). Despite the potentially complex  relationship  be- tween individual variation and population response, environment–trait relationships  observed  in  individ- uals are routinely employed to predict the outcome of population processes (Figure 1). For example, in epide- miology environmental–trait relationships are used in parameter-based approaches for calculating the basic reproduction number, R0 (Brand et al., 2016; Mordecai et al., 2017; Parham & Michael, 2010) (expected num- ber of secondary cases produced by a single infection in a completely susceptible population). This implicitly assumes that variation observed in a population's trait distribution is independent of environmental  stressors and population dynamics, such that an averaged trait value suitably represents the population at any given time and location (Liu-Helmersson et al., 2016). This is the mean-field approach and there is an increasing body of evidence that this approach under-represents the impor- tance of variation between individuals and community structure in population ecology (Cator et al., 2019; Fox & Kendall, 2002; McGill et al., 2006; Violle et al., 2012). Consideration of purely stochastic forms of variation has demonstrated that the outcome of population processes such as species persistence do not always follow mean- field predictions (Hart et al., 2016; Morozov et al., 2013). In contrast to environmental or demographic noise, in- dividual variation caused by phenotypic plasticity has a strong mechanistic component, and so can and should be suitably accounted for (Nylin & Gotthard, 2002). To describe the effect phenotypic plasticity has on population dynamics it is key to link trait and effect mechanistically combining empirically derived relation- ships with theoretical methods. For populations with distinct generations this can be addressed using meth- ods such as integral projection models (IPMs) which are widely used to represent trait variation within popula- tions (Childs et al., 2003; Kuss et al., 2008). IPMs impose observed trait distributions upon populations and map changes in these distributions forwards in time to pre- dict long-term and general trends. Due to their simplistic           Current one way predictive frameworks Our interactive predictive framework        F IG U R E 1 Current predictive frameworks typically use environment-trait relationships, such as reaction norms, to predict population responses without consideration of how population processes may alter the traits individuals express. Our framework incorporates environment-trait relationships that interact with population dynamics and trait distributions. This allows the framework to account for the effect of interaction between environment, trait, and population as experienced by many organisms in our predictions of population processes Reaction Norm   Spec. 1  Spec. 2 Environment, E Environment, E Trait Distribution   Population Model = , ,    Trait, T Time, t Trait, T Time, t       Environment, E Proportion, p Trait, T Trait, T Population, N Trait, T Proportion, p Trait, T Population, N | 2408 PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY AS A CAUSE AND CONSEQUENCE OF POPULATION DYNAMICS   j 1 2 3 z 1 2 3 z  representation of plasticity and ease of parameterisation, IPMs are used to make cross-taxa syntheses on global species trends (Salguero-Gómez et al., 2018). However, there is a recognised need for modelling approaches that can consider the effect of detailed intra-generation dy- namics alongside inter-generational dynamics on the ex- pression of phenotypic plasticity and so can predict how these feedback  to  alter  population  processes  (Bolnick et al., 2011; Hendry, 2016; Johnston et al., 2019; Lion, 2018; Lipowsky et al., 2015; Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005; Sgrò et al., 2016; Turcotte & Levine, 2016; Violle et al., 2012). Here, we propose a novel general mathematical frame- work that links experimentally derived environment– trait relationships to well-parametrised stage-structured population models that allow trait distributions to emerge from population–trait–environment interactions (Figure 1). We utilise a continuous-time stage-structured modelling approach, widely used to model organisms with multiple distinct life stages (Murdoch et al., 2003), adapted to represent the persistent and delayed effects of phenotypic plasticity across multiple developmental stages. By using our framework to represent mechanisms of individual variation in response to environmental change, we show that even simple forms of phenotypic plasticity can lead to complex population dynamical responses that previous approaches overlook. This is demonstrated by an application of our framework to a classical population ecology study, Nicholson's blowflies (Nicholson, 1957), where it has been hypothesised that previously unexplained population dynamics can be at- tributed to phenotypic plasticity. This application reveals a rich set of counter-intuitive population-dynamical be- haviours caused by the interaction between phenotypic plasticity and population dynamics.   MATERI ALS AND METHODS We present a modelling framework that  dynamically links the expression of phenotypic plasticity in individu- als to population dynamics. We combine a continuous- time stage-structured population model in the form described in Gurney et al., (1983) (as in Figure 2a), widely used to predict the population dynamics of inter- acting life-stages (e.g. Gurney et al., (1980)), with a set of empirically-derived reaction norms. Models created using our framework are systems of stage-phenotypically structured delay-differential  equations,  within  which, we track cohorts of individuals based on their cumula- tive environmental experience. Each cohort is then as- sociated with a unique phenotype. (Figure 2b). Within our framework an individual's phenotype may consist of multiple traits varying in response to multiple environ- mental factors, both current and historic. This creates a dynamic phenotypic structure that allows multiple phe- notypes to be represented within a population simulta- neously. By using this approach, the distribution of traits expressed within a population is not assumed, as it is in an IPM (Merow et al., 2014), but instead emerges as a feature of empirically verified mechanistic processes. This links individual-level variation in life-history traits to population-level response and so represents the effects of phenotypic plasticity on populations. Our approach is able to represent both intra- and inter-generational forms of phenotypic plasticity, in response to both instantane- ous and delayed environmental  conditions.  Moreover, we can track the effects of multiple environmental cues on single or multiple traits, giving rise to a highly flexible modelling framework.   The general framework for representing phenotypic plasticity in stage-structured population models Variation caused by phenotypic plasticity is often ex- pressed in terms of a reaction norm, a function that de- scribes how an individual's environmental experience alters the phenotype they express (Nylin & Gotthard, 1998) (e.g. food consumed as a juvenile predicts adult body mass). We assume that organisms with similar expe- riences of their environment express the same phenotype and to represent this we create multiple linked copies of the Gurney et al. framework (as in Figure 2b). Each copy corresponds to a unique set of environmental conditions and individuals move through this structure on a path determined by  their  current  and  historical  experience of the environment. This allows us to track cohorts of individuals that share the same  environmental  history and so represent the effects of phenotypic plasticity on populations. Consider  a  stage-structured  population  with life- stages where phenotypic plasticity is expressed accord- ing to d reaction norms r1 (a) , . . . ,  rd (a) in response to environmental cues a (t) = a1 (t) , . . . ,  az (t) . For com- putational tractability, we discretise each environmental cue, j (t), into mj subintervals and denote by jp the mid- point of the pth subinterval of the discretisation of aj (t). We define an environmental class to be a vector of length with entries that consist of one midpoint from each dis- cretised environmental cue, that is,  a1l , a2l , a3l , . . . ,  azl      , where lj  ∈ 1 , . . . ,  mj . We define g: ℝz → Ωa such that g (a (t)) = a1l , a2l , a3l , . . . ,  azl , if aj (t) takes values within the lth subinterval of aj (t). The function g defines a mapping of onto the discretisation of .

The population being considered in all cases is stage-structured with  life-stages. The number of individuals in life-stage i , expressing phenotype j is denoted Ni,j. (a), The Gurney et al. (Gurney et al., 1983) framework for stage-structured populations that is used as a basis for the novel framework. This framework represents a continuous age structure by a discrete number of developmental classes e.g. eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults. (b), The most general form of the novel framework, where an individual's experience of the environmental cues in each developmental stage determines the phenotype it expresses as partitioned by the environmental classes. (c), The new framework adapted to represent developmental plasticity in life-stage 2. It is assumed that individuals experience an environmental cue in life-stage 1 that does not effect individuals in life-stage 1 but results in the expression of phenotypic plasticity in subsequent life-stages. This allows the reduction of the phenotypic structure in life-stage 1 to just a single class, N1,Tot = ∑m j = 1 N1,j . (d), The new framework adapted to represent a maternal effect in response to an environmental cue experienced by parents in life-stage n that manifests as phenotypic plasticity in life-stage 1 which is then assumed to have no effect on subsequent life-stages  and we denote the set of all such vectors (environmental classes) by Ωa. We assign an ordering to the elements of the set of environmental classes Ωa (see Supplementary dNi,j (t) dt = Ri,j (t) − Mi,j (t) − Di,j (t) ,  (1) Information 6 for an example ordering) and let ak denote the kth element of the ordered set, i.e. the kth environmen- tal class. Thus, g (a) = ak if g (a) is the kth element of the ordered set Ωa. Environmental classes define cohorts of individuals that have experienced a shared environmental for i ∈ 1 , . . . ,  n, and   j ∈ 1 , . . . ,  m. The death rate is Di,j (t) = i,j (t) Ni,j (t) where i,j (t) is the mortality rate of individuals in life-stage i and environmental class j. The recruitment term in Equation 1 when i = 1 is given by history. We assume that an individual's current and historic experience of the environment  completely  determines the phenotype an individual acquires when it matures R1,j (t) =  m  k = 1  wkj(a(t))  n  v = 1  fJv,k (t)Nv,k (t)    ,  (2) from life stage i to i + 1 or is born into stage life stage 1 at time t. This permits the effects of environmental vari- ation to be deferred to future developmental stages or generations. As we discretise the environmental cues this means there are a discrete number  of phenotypes  that can arise in the framework. The traits that these pheno- types  express  are  calculated  using  the  reaction  norms according to, rk (g (a)). This process pre-defines both the traits individuals express and the range of environmental conditions that give rise to those individuals.   Incorporating phenotypic plasticity into stage- structured models  Denote the number of individuals in life-stage i and en- vironmental class j at time t by Ni,j (t). Denote by Ri,j (t) the rate of recruitment of individuals into life-stage i and environmental class  j, Mi,j  (t) the rate of maturation out of life-stage i and environmental class j, and Di,j (t) the death rate in life-stage i and environmental class j. The for  j = 1, . . . ,  m where wkj (a (t)) denotes the proportion of individuals from environmental class k that transition to environmental class j at time t and f]v,k (t) is the birth rate of individuals in life-stage   and environmental class k. The transition functions, wkj (a (t)), are the mechanism through which the environment acts to express phenotypic plasticity within the model. Equation 2 represents the birth of new individuals into the first life-stage and environmen- tal class j by parents from across all environmental classes and life-stages. The birth term, Pv,k (t) Nv,k (t) describes the number of new individuals produced by parents in life- stage  and environmental class k, and is summed across all life-stages and environmental-classes to account for all new individuals entering the population. The transition functions wkj (a (t)) then determine the proportion of the new births that are assigned to environmental class j de- pendent on the environmental state. The number of individuals recruited into life-stage i and environmental class j is equal to the number of indi- viduals maturing out of life-stage i − 1that are assigned to environmental class j. Hence, we have that for i = 2 , . . . ,  n | 2410 PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY AS A CAUSE AND CONSEQUENCE OF POPULATION DYNAMICS   population is described by the system of equations and j = 1 , . . . ,  m, R1,j (t) = m wkj (  (t))M i−1,k (t) . | 2411 BRASS et al.  t − 'f  Further, the number of individuals maturing out of life- stage i and environmental class  j is equal to the number of individuals recruited into life-stage i and environmen- tal class j one developmental period ago that survived.

Hence, et al., 2002). In blowflies, body size is linearly related to the number of ovarioles an adult has (Vogt et al., 1985) which determines the maximum number of eggs the adult can produce (Jannicke Moe et al., 2002), and so larval competition alters the maximum potential fecundity of adults. We regard the intensity of larval competition for food resources as an environmental cue, altering maxi- mum potential adult fecundity and through pupal stage survival. It is important to note that maximum potential adult fecundity is distinct from observed adult fecundity, R1,j (t) =  m  k = 1   ) wkj(a(t))Ri−1,k (t − ri−1,k )Si−1,k (t)   , (3) the former representing the maximum number of eggs an individual could produce under ideal environmental conditions and the latter representing the actual number for i = 2 , . . . ,  n a nd  j = 1 , . . . ,  m where of eggs an individual produces under the environmental Si,j (t) = exp − t i,j  i,j t�  dt�  .

The exact form of the transition function, wkj (a (t)), is left unspecified as the way individuals transition from one environmental class and life-stage to the next is case specific. However, the choice of wkj (a (t)) is subject to the   constraints   0 ≤ wkj (a (t)) ≤ 1, ∀ j, k ∈ 1, . . . ,  m   and amount of adult food supplied was reduced from an “un- limited” amount to a more limiting 1000 mg after around 600 days. The reduction of adult food resulted in an in- creased average adult population density, and the stabili- sation of the previously regular population cycles. This is somewhat counter-intuitive, since a decrease in available m   j = 1 wkj (a(t)) = 1. Although the transition functions are resource substantially increased the average number of individuals and stabilised the previously regular oscilla- stage-independent, the environmental vector a (t) is able to refer the state of each environmental cue independently and so can consider the sequence of past environments that an individual has encountered.   RESULTS Application of the novel modelling framework to Nicholson's blowflies To demonstrate the insights that can be gained from our framework we applied it to Nicholson's classical blowfly study (Nicholson, 1957), which aimed to describe how populations adjust in response to changes in their abi- otic environment. In this study, the population dynam- ics of Lucilia cuprina (Wiedemann, 1830) were examined under different competitive conditions. In each culture, food was supplied separately to larvae and adults and both food supplies were  replenished  daily.  Cultures were maintained for over two years and the number of adults and eggs present was recorded every two days. The results of Nicholson's study have been extensively discussed in theoretical ecology (Bakker, 1963; Glyzin, 2018; Gurney et al., 1983; May, 1986; Wood, 2010). In Nicholson's experiment, blowflies experienced competition for food their larval and adult stages. Competition for food between adult blowflies reduces fecundity if individuals cannot acquire enough protein to mature all their eggs (Vogt et al., 1985). Larval com- petition for food reduces adult body size and the proba- bility of survival through the pupal stage (Jannicke Moe | 2412 PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY AS A CAUSE AND CONSEQUENCE OF POPULATION DYNAMICS   tions—an example of the paradox of enrichment (Roy & Chattopadhyay, 2007). Nicholson hypothesises that the  population  dynam- ics observed in the blowfly culture can be explained by phenotypic plasticity induced by larval competition. Adults in the period of unlimited adult food were ob- served to produce many eggs. When these eggs hatched into larvae, they experienced high levels of competition for larval food. This caused very few larvae to gain suffi- cient mass to pupate successfully, resulting in increased pupal mortality and low adult numbers in the next gen- eration. When adult food was limited, an  increase  in adult competition resulted in fewer eggs being produced. The lower number of eggs resulted in fewer larvae and a larger amount of food being available per larva, sub- sequently reducing larval competition and juvenile mor- tality causing an increase in average adult population density. We evaluate evidence for Nicholson's hypothesis and heuristic arguments using the modelling framework derived here to represent phenotypic plasticity induced by resource competition in blowfly populations.   Model description To formulate a model that represents phenotypic plastic- ity in blowfly populations we extend a previously derived mean-field model from Gurney et al. (1983), detailed in Supplementary Information 3, that considered only the instantaneous effects of adult competition on blowfly population dynamics. We introduce reaction norms re- lating through pupal-stage survival (Jannicke Moe et al., | 2413 BRASS et al.

In the culture adults blowflies were given unlimited food for 610 days, represented by KA = 2000 mg, which converts to 1800 mg of food supplied. After day 610 the amount of adult food supplied, KA, was then reduced to KA = 1200 mg, which converts to 1000mg of food supplied daily.

The number of environmental classes is n = 64 and each of the coloured lines represents the number of adults in an environmental class.

As this is an example of developmental plas- ticity the model takes the form of Figure 2c, for examples of models where we consider maternal effects or multiple environmental cues with a cumulative effect over multi- ple stages see Supplementary Information 5. We assume eggs are laid into a single egg class, within which all individuals express the same phenotype (i.e. we assume no maternal effects). After a fixed developmental period, eggs hatch into a single larval class where again all individuals express the same phenotype. When a larva matures into a pupa, the amount of food that it obtained in the larval stage is determined by dividing the total food provided over the larval period by the number of individu- als present in the culture over that period assuming scram- ble competition. The food obtained by an individual in the larval period is subsequently used to determine the traits that the individual expresses as a pupa and as an adult. is dropped completely for terms relating to larvae. As we only consider a single environmental cue (larval food) the set of environmental classes, Ωa, consists only of the midpoints of a (t). Denote by L (t) the number of larvae at time t and by Aj (t) the number of adults at time t in environmental class j. Associated with each environmental class are the maxi- mum fecundity of adults qj, and survival through the pupal and juvenile stages S  . Recruitment into the larval stage is j denoted RL (t) and recruitment of larvae to adults in envi- ronmental class  j is denoted R   (t). The environmental j classes are parametrised by discretising an adapted reac- tion norm for through pupal-stage survival (Jannicke Moe et al., 2002) and a reaction norm for maximum adult fe- cundity is approximated from various sources (Webber, 1954). A detailed discussion of how the model is parame- trised is detailed in Supplementary Information 7. As a proxy for the environmental cue, total protein obtained per larvae over the course of the larval period, We abbreviate the previously introduced N dropping the i,j notation we use the average protein available per larvae per day over the course of the larval period. We assume larvae i and replacing the N by a more descriptive letter reflecting the life-stage, for example, L is used for larvae and A for adults. Similarly, as adults are the only explicitly modelled life-stage that expresses phenotypic divide the available food equally allowing the cue to be expressed as follows: KLrL Adult Population Potential Fecundity Pupal survival | 2414 PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY AS A CAUSE AND CONSEQUENCE OF POPULATION DYNAMICS   t − r plasticity (pupae are implicitly modelled due to a lack of density dependence (Gurney et al., 1983) the j subscript a(t) = ,   t L(s)ds L  (4) | 2415 BRASS et al.

After the food  was  restricted  to 1000 mg at 610 days, the oscillations dampen, and the average population density substantially increases cap- turing the change in dynamical behaviour observed in Nicholson's culture. Although the population density of the simulated blowflies matches the experimental data for j ∈ 1 , . . . ,  m where I   t − rE   is an inoculation term that begins the dynamics (Kot, 2001), and represents the introduction of larvae into the system at t = 0, and qj and S are determined by the reaction norms. j We assume that adults compete equally for the total available food regardless of phenotype, and so the in- stantaneous effects of adult competition are represented the amplitude of the oscillations does not match. This mismatch can be explained by the high sensitivity of the model to food supply, a discussion of which, accompa- nied by food supplies which correctly predict both am- plitudes, is provided in Supplementary Information 4. Initially, the population exhibits temporal cycles in the dominant phenotypes (Figure 3b,c). In the time periods where no new adults are being recruited, the phenotypic by e − ATot(t − E )∕KA where ATot m j = 1 Aj indicates compe- composition of the pupal and adult population does not change, resulting in the flat regions of Figure 3b,c. After tition  across  all  phenotypes.  The  transition  function wj (a (t)), determines the fraction of individuals entering environmental class Aj (t) at time t, and is defined food restriction, the range of phenotypes  expressed within the population is greatly reduced. Pupae  and adults in this period belong to a group of closely related environmental classes of individuals with relatively low trait values. As there is no difference between the distri- wj (a (t)) = 1, if g (a (t)) = aj , 0, otherwise (11) butions of maximum fecundity and through pupal stage survival, we hereafter only discuss fecundity. As our model extends a previously derived non-plastic blowfly population model by Gurney et al. it is natural for j ∈ 1 , . . . ,  m. This choice of wj (a (t)) restricts recruit- ment of individuals into a single environmental class based on that individual's experience of previous larval com- petition and indicates that maximum adult fecundity is uniquely determined by past experience of larval competi- tion. This restriction is appropriate, as due to the assump- = | 2416 PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY AS A CAUSE AND CONSEQUENCE OF POPULATION DYNAMICS   tion that all food is split equally, larvae being recruited at to question whether the population dynamics observed in Figure 3a can be attributed to the non-plastic popu- lation model. To test this, we simulate the non-plastic blowfly model, the formulation of which is provided in Supplementary Information 3. The non-plastic model overestimates the average adult density in both food conditions, predicts a decrease in adult density when | 2417 BRASS et al.   resource availability decreases, and maintains the same population dynamics before and after  the  resource change as can be observed in Figure 4 (see Supplementary Information 3 for further details).   Understanding the wider effects of phenotypic plasticity and population dynamic interactions To explore how robust the population dynamics observed in the blowfly system are to conditions beyond those in Nicholson's experiment, we simulate the population tra- jectories for a wide range of possible combinations of adult and larval food supplies. For each food supply we record the average adult population density (Figure 5a), the average potential fecundity (maximum number of eggs an individual could produce in conditions of excess adult food, Figure 5b), the average observed fecundity (the number of eggs an individual actually produces in the context of competitive pressures within the popula- tion, Figure 5c), and the difference between the average potential and observed fecundities (Figure 5d). The model predicts that the blowfly population ex- hibits one of three dynamical behaviours. In the leftmost region of Figure 5a–d, increases in larval food supply do  not  change  the  abundance  or  fecundity  (potential or observed) of adults. This suggests that in this region the population is limited most by the amount of adult food available. The population in this region consists of a small number of phenotypes with similar trait values (c.f. the small range of colours in the lines representing the abundance of individuals  in  each  environmental class in Figure 5e and point (e) in Figure ). In the right- most region of Figure 5a–d, increases in adult food sup- ply do not change the abundance or fecundity of adults, suggesting that the availability of larval food is a limit- ing factor. The phenotypes expressed within the popu- lation are more diverse and the population's phenotypic composition changes during the course of a population cycle (c.f. the larger range of coloured lines in Figure 5g and point (g)). In the central region (the dark segment in Figure 5a), increases in either adult or larval food supply change the abundance and fecundity of adults. The adult population exhibits dampened oscillations and a small number of phenotypes with low trait values (Figure 5f and point (f)). This suggests that in this region the pop- ulation is limited by the availability of both larval food and adult food. We conclude that the balance of resource availability between adult and larval blowflies governs the dynamical behaviour of the blowfly population. The population dynamics we observe are therefore charac- terised by the interaction between the two sources of density dependence: the instantaneous effects of adult competition and the delayed effects of larval competition through developmental plasticity. Nicholson observed that when a culture initially sup- plied with 50g of larval food was supplied with 1g of adult food that ‘the oscillation [of the blowfly population] was comparatively slight and had lost almost all evidence of periodicity, whereas any appreciable departure from the rate of one gram of ground liver per day in either direc- tion resulted in the increase in the amplitude of oscilla- tion’. The model predicts that when a population with a low adult food supply is supplied with increasingly more adult food that there is a sharp rise and then fall in av- erage adult density as observed in Figure 5a. Similarly, when a population with a relatively low larval food sup- ply is provided with increasingly more larval food, we observe a similar sharp rise and fall in average adult den- sity. The behaviour Nicholson describes is precisely the behaviour that our model predicts, demonstrating that phenotypic plasticity is a mechanism by which the para- dox of enrichment can be reconciled. The predictions the model makes about the link be- tween traits expressed by individuals and population responses  are  somewhat  counter-intuitive  and  would be difficult to anticipate from reaction  norms  alone.

The larval food provided is KL = 50000 mg in each simulation and the adult food has been selected such that the average potential fecundity trait is 25, KA = 351 mg, KA = 901 mg and KA = 4151 mg, respectively   reasonable to predict that individuals are most repro- ductively successful when potential fecundity is high. However, in Figure 5b–d we see that the food conditions that produce individuals with the highest average poten- tial fecundity are also those that prevent this from being exploited and are associated with low average observed fecundity and consequently low reproductive success. By comparison, conditions that produce  individuals  with low average potential fecundity allow those individuals to achieve this potential, meaning that individuals  in these conditions are on average more reproductively suc- cessful despite their lower trait value. Therefore, the rela- tive contribution of high and low trait-valued individuals to the intensity of future larvae competition changes dynamically according to the environmental conditions the population is subject to. This demonstrates that the seemingly reasonable assumption we made from the re- action norm alone, that high trait value corresponds to high reproductive success, does not hold (Reed et al., 2013). We predict that individuals with traits that are in- dicative of high individual performance, such as aver- age potential fecundity and average observed fecundity, arise from environmental conditions where the popula- tion is least abundant and most  unstable.  When  aver- age observed fecundity is highest (rightmost regions of Figure 5a–d) population density is lowest. Conversely,  when the population density is highest, and the oscilla- tions are damped (central regions of Figure 5a–d), the average observed fecundity is low, and the average po- tential fecundity is at a minimum. This shows that over most food conditions average potential fecundity and average observed fecundity are poor predictors of indi- vidual and population success. Even when average trait value is a good predictor of observed fecundity (right- most region of Figure 5a–d) the population's dynamics are regulated by phenotypic plasticity and so would be misrepresented by an approach that uses averaged trait values. Conversely, when average trait value is a bad predictor of fecundity (leftmost regions of Figure 5a–d) an averaged trait approach correctly predicts the pop- ulation dynamics (as can be observed by comparing Figure 4 to Figure 5e). The food amounts supplied in the simulations shown in Figure 5e–g were selected to produce populations with the same average potential adult fecundity. Despite each population sharing the same average trait value, each population exhibits distinct dynamics and trait distribu- tions which would be overlooked by an approach using averaged trait values. Only by accounting for trait vari- ation between individuals arising from the cumulative effect of each individual's experience is it possible to cap- ture the population-level effects of these three scenarios. This highlights the need to consider the individual and Adult Population Adult Population Adult Population | 2419 BRASS et al.   population-level consequences of  phenotypic  plasticity in a unified framework akin to what we derive here.  DISCUSSION We demonstrate that the interaction between phenotypic plasticity in individuals and population-level effects can be a source of rich population dynamical phenomena. The disconnect between individual and population per- formance demonstrated in the example of Nicholson's blowflies, although certainly not universal, provides a mechanistic explanation of how pressures that are mala- daptive for individuals can be beneficial for populations and vice versa (Edelaar & Bolnick, 2019; Louthan et al., 2013; Reed et al., 2013; Weiner et al., 2017). By represent- ing the mechanisms by which individual variation and population-level processes interact, we generate insights into how populations adapt to changing environments, which is crucial for understanding phenomena such as ecological tipping points (Dakos et al., 2019). Further, our findings support numerous previous studies propos- ing that failure to represent the effects of individual vari- ation on populations is more consequential than simply mis-estimating demography (Bolnick et al., 2011; Lloyd- Smith et al., 2005; Sgrò et al., 2016; Violle et al., 2012), as we demonstrate that patterns in individual variation can drive complete changes in the dynamical behaviour of the system being considered. This is corroborated by observational studies where it has been found that the re- sponse of populations to interventions was influenced by individual variation (Cameron & Benton, 2004; Cameron et al., 2013). The framework is broadly applicable to sys- tems where interaction between  population  dynamics and trait is important in determining the outcome of a process of interest. For example, when considering insect vectors of diseases or crop pests (e.g. mosquitoes or lo- custs) both abundance and trait to interact to determine the health or  economic  risk  posed  (Chandrasegaran et al., 2020; Sword et al., 2010). Developing the model for Nicholson's blowflies was considerably simplified as we consider a well-studied model organism under controlled laboratory conditions. Although reaction norms are widely available across a broad range of taxa, outside of laboratory settings ad- ditional sources of environmental variation require the inclusion of reaction norms of higher dimension (i.e. a reaction norm considering the effect of temperature and con-specific density on development rate). However, our framework is designed to represent complex systems and so this should not pose an obstacle to implementation. For species where particular environment–trait relation- ships are not fully quantified or are missing entirely, due diligence must be observed in determining how sensitive the dynamics are to these uncertainties. For example, reaction norms are often most uncertain at environmen- tal extremes (Brady et al., 2013) and so this uncertainty would need careful consideration when using our frame- work to predict dynamics at population range limits. Although we demonstrate that  individual  variation can change and be changed by population processes, we do not predict when trait variation alters the outcome of these processes. In invasion biology, metrics derived from reaction norms are often used to predict the com- petitive viability of native and invasive species (Richards et al., 2006). Although the approach of using reaction norms directly accurately predicts the success of some invasive species (Knop & Reusser, 2012; Luo et al., 2019), it fails to explain the success of others (Muth & Pigliucci, 2007). This inconsistency limits the usefulness of reac- tion norms as a general predictor of a species invasive- ness (Hulme, 2008; Palacio-López and Gianoli, 2011). Here, we demonstrate that if one directly compares re- action norms without also considering a greater ecolog- ical context, one may arrive at erroneous conclusions. Therefore, it is important to determine more generally when reaction norms alone are sufficient to predict pop- ulation dynamics and in doing so reconcile the role of phenotypic plasticity in biological invasions and popu- lation biology.

This review distin-guishes two conceptually distinct types of costs: phenotypic costs and plasticity costs. Phenotypic costs are assessed from patterns of covariation, typically between a focal trait and a separate trait relevant to fitness. Plasticity costs, separable from phenotypic costs, are gauged by comparing the fitness of genotypes with equivalent phenotypes within two environments but differing in plasticity and fitness. Subtleties associated with both types of costs are illustrated by a body of work addressing predator-induced plasticity. Such subtleties, and potential interplay between the two types of costs, have also been addressed, often in studies involving genetic model organisms. In some in-stances, investigators have pinpointed the mechanistic basis of plasticity. In this vein, microbialwork is especially illuminating andhas three additional strengths.

Using individual-based simulations, we compare the RN and GRN approach and find a number of striking differences. Most importantly, the GRN model results in a much higher diversity of responsive strategies than the RN model.

A commonly predicted cost to plasticity is that plastic genotypes are likely to suffer from developmental instability. Adaptive plasticity requires that the developing organism can in some way sense what environment it is in or how well it is performing in that environment. These two information pathways—an """"environmental signal"""" or a """"performance signal"""" that indicates how well a developing phenotype matches the optimum in the current environment—can differ in their consequences for the organism and its evolution. Here, we consider how developmental instability might emerge as a side-effect of these two distinct mechanisms. Because a performance cue allows a regulatory feedback loop connecting a trait to a feedback signal, we hypothesized that plastic genotypes using a performance signal would be more developmentally robust compared to those using a purely environmental signal. Using a numerical model of a network of gene interactions, we show that plasticity comes at a cost of developmental instability when the plastic response is mediated via an environmental signal, but not when it is mediated via a performance signal. We also show that a performance signal mechanism can evolve even in a constant environment, leading to genotypes pre-adapted for plasticity to novel environments even in populations without a history of environmental heterogeneity.Here are explanations of the meaning of each column in the dataset:  meanP: Mean phenotypic value over all replicated development of the genotype of interest.  sdP: Standard deviation in phenotypic value among all replicated development of the genotype of interest.  meanW: Mean fitness over all replicated development of the genotype of interest.  sdW: Standard deviation in fitness among all replicated development of the genotype of interest.  trait_optima: Optimal trait in the environment considered.  nbGenes: Number of genes.

The potential for this to happen depends in part on how well plastic responses are aligned with the additive genetic variance and covariance in traits. Using meta-analysis, we demonstrate that plastic responses to novel environments tend to occur along phenotype dimensions that harbor substantial amounts of additive genetic variation. This suggests that selection for or against environmentally induced phenotypes typically will be effective. One interpretation of the alignment between the direction of plasticity and the main axis of additive genetic variation is that developmental systems tend to respond to environmental novelty as they do to genetic mutation. This makes it challenging to distinguish if the direction of evolution is biased by plasticity or genetic “constraint.” Our results therefore highlight a need for new theoretical and empirical approaches to address the role of plasticity in evolution.</p",,Article/Letter to editor,"Cryptic genetic, Evolvability, Phenotypic accommodation, Phenotypic plasticity, Variation",,

One such adaptation is phenotypic plasticity, or the ability of a single genotype to produce multiple environmentally-induced phenotypes. Yet, not all plasticity is adaptive. Despite the renewed interest in adaptive phenotypic plasticity and its consequences for evolution, much less is known about maladaptive plasticity. However, maladaptive plasticity is likely an important driver of phenotypic similarity among populations living in different environments. This paper traces four strategies for overcoming maladaptive plasticity that result in phenotypic similarity, two of which involve genetic changes (standing genetic variation, genetic compensation) and two of which do not (standing epigenetic variation, plastic compensation). Plastic compensation is defined as adaptive plasticity overcoming maladaptive plasticity. In particular, plastic compensation may increase the likelihood of genetic compensation by facilitating population persistence.

However, there are several different factors that may constrain the evolution of plasticity, but few models have considered costs and limiting factors simultaneously. Here we use a simulation model to investigate how the optimal level of plasticity in a population depends on a fixed fitness cost for maintaining a potential for plasticity or an incremental fitness cost for producing a plastic response in combination with environmental unpredictability (environmental fluctuation speed) limiting plasticity. Our model identifies two mechanisms that act, almost separately, to constrain the evolution of plasticity: 1) The fitness cost of plasticity scaled by the non-plastic environmental tolerance, and 2) the environmental fluctuation speed scaled by the rate of phenotypic change. That is, the evolution of plasticity is constrained by the high cost of plasticity in combination with high tolerance for environmental variation, or fast environmental changes in combination with slow plastic response. Qualitatively similar results are found when fixed and incremental fitness costs of plasticity are incorporated, although a larger degree of plasticity is selected for with an incremental cost.

Indeed, organisms live in complex environments where numerous factors can impact the phenotypic expression of traits (inter‐environment axis), possess multiple traits that can influence each other's expression (inter‐trait axis) and differ in their genetic background (inter‐genotype axis), which can not only impact the traits' values but also their plasticity. We addressed six questions related to phenotypic plasticity: (a) do different environmental gradients show similar effects on a given trait? (b) Are the effects of two environmental gradients on a trait additive? (c) Do different traits show similar plastic response to a given environmental gradient? (d) Do the (co)variances between traits vary across environmental gradients? (e) Do genotypes differ in their plastic response to a given environmental gradient?

However, despite this adaptive assumption, the nature of selection on plasticity within populations is still poorly documented. Here, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of estimates of selection on thermal plasticity. Although there is a large literature on thermal plasticity, we found very few studies that estimated coefficients of selection on measures of plasticity. Those that did do not provide strong support for selection on plasticity, with the majority of estimates of directional selection on plasticity being weak and non-significant, and no evidence for selection on plasticity overall. Although further estimates are clearly needed before general conclusions can be drawn, at present there is not clear empirical support for any assumption that plasticity in response to temperature is under selection. We present a multivariate mixed model approach for robust estimation of selection on plasticity and demonstrate how it can be implemented.

Phage host range becomes plastic in the presence of restriction-modification (R-M) systems in their hosts. I modeled the evolution of phage host range in the presence of R-M systems. The model makes two main predictions. The first prediction is that the offspring of the first phage to gain a new methylation pattern by infecting a new host make up a disproportionate fraction of the subsequent specialist population, indicating that the plastically produced phenotype is highly predictive of evolutionary outcome. The second prediction is that the first phage to gain this pattern is not always genetically distinct from other phages in the population. Taken together, these results suggest that plasticity could play a causal role on par with mutation during the evolution of phage host range.

Phenotypic plasticity has long beenrecognized as a key strategy enabling organisms to respond to varyingenvironments both adaptively and non-adaptively (Bradshaw, 1965).Although the optimal response to a heterogeneous set of environ-mental challenges is perfect plasticity—in which an organism possessesperfect information on its current environment, and mechanisms toproduce an appropriate phenotypic response at all points in develop-ment—the rarity or absence of this capacity in natural populationssuggests that there are constraints on the evolution of plasticity.DeWitt et al. (1998) contrasted two types of restrictions: costs, whichlead to reduced fitness when a trait is produced via plasticity ratherthan constitutively, and limits, an inability to produce the optimaltrait value.Investigations into the constraints on the evolution of adaptiveplasticity (including costs and limits) have been conducted throughtwo approaches: modeling and empirically. Models investigating theevolution of niche breadth or generalists vs specialists generally assumethat advantages of being a specialist in one environment areaccompanied by disadvantages in another (for example, vanTienderen, 1991; Lynch and Lande, 1993) and formally considerphenotypic plasticity as one component of being a generalist. Con-versely, plastic generalists are considered to be ‘jacks-of-all-trades’ but‘masters-of-none’ (for example, Richards et al., 2006). Experimentalwork to identify proposed trade-offs between generalists and specialistshas led to inquiries into potential mechanisms in response to habitatheterogeneity, which may lead to plastic generalists or specialists(Callahan et al., 2008).Both empirical and modeling approaches have employed theconcept of a cost of plasticity as a cornerstone of arguments aboutwhy organisms are not infinitely and ideally plastic: the underlyingassumption behind these arguments has been that organisms with anenhanced capacity to exhibit plasticity must pay a price in fitness (vanTienderen, 1991; Moran, 1992). This led to the expectation that costsor limits should be readily detectable. Dozens of investigations haveexplicitly looked for costs of plasticity, and many more have invokedthem. Detection of costs of plasticity, however, has been infrequent1Department of Biology, College of Charleston, Charleston, SC, USA; 2Department of Biology, West Chester University, West Chester, PA, USA; 3Barnard College, ColumbiaUniversity, New York, NY, USA; 4Department of Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA; 5Research School of Biology, Australian National University, Acton,Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia; 6Department of Biology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA; 7Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology,University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA; 8Ronin Institute, Montclair, NJ, USA; 9Department of Biological Sciences, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA; 10Departmentof Ecology and Evolution, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO, USA; 11Department of Ecology, Evolution and Behavior, University of Minnesota, St Paul, MN, USA;12Department of Biology, University of Southern Denmark, Max-Planck Odense Centre on the Biodemography of Aging, Odense, Denmark and 13Department of Ecology andEvolutionary Biology, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USACorrespondence: Dr C Murren, Department of Biology, College of Charleston, 66 George Street, Charleston, SC 29424, USA.E-mail: murrenc@cofc.eduReceived 31 July 2014; revised 21 November 2014; accepted 15 December 2014; published online 18 February 2015Heredity (2015) 115, 293–301& 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved 0018-067X/15www.nature.com/hdy(see meta-analyses by van Kleunen and Fischer, 2005; van Buskirk andSteiner, 2009). In the findings of van Buskirk and Steiner (2009), of536 tests they report 262 positive coefficients and 262 negativecoefficients, with 12 zeroes. This balanced distribution is fullyconsistent with the results of the regression of a random variableagainst fitness. Relative to the expectation from a truly randompattern, the van Buskirk and Steiner results do show a surplus ofsignificant results (~20% in each direction). However, this mightderive from a combination of (a) under-reporting of non-significantfindings, (b) type I error (suggested by their evidence for a higherlikelihood of significance with small sample sizes) and (c) accumula-tion of significant results due to replicated analyses on geneticallycorrelated traits. Furthermore, investigation of the typical two-environment tests for costs has revealed flaws in the analyticalframework (Auld et al., 2010; Roff, 2011). The lack of conformationof results to predictions has prompted us to take a fresh look at boththe conceptual framework and the empirical approaches to evaluatingconstraints on the evolution of plasticity and highlight promising areasof investigation.In this paper, we begin by addressing the distinction between costsof plasticity and costs of phenotype production, showing that thesetwo types of costs are often conflated. We argue that costs ofphenotype are more prevalent in many investigations of plasticity,and together with the environmental context may be a critical limit tothe evolution of plasticity. We then refocus on examining constraintsto the evolution of plasticity. In this discussion of constraints, weevaluate how costs of phenotypes might be offset, the potentialinfluence of limits of plasticity, and offer discussion of promisingresearch directions not previously evaluated in this context. In contrastto previous reviews distinguishing between costs of phenotype vs costsof plasticity, here we emphasize issues critical to evaluating potentialcosts of plasticity. We also draw attention to the importance of limitsof plasticity in our overall discussion of constraints. We follow Auldet al. (2010) in describing the limits to plasticity as trait based, where aplastic genotype produces a phenotype further away from theoptimum for a particular environment than a non-plastic genotype.In addition, we offer a synthesis of novel and integrative approachesthat move beyond classic quantitative genetics models and set newgoals for inquiry in plasticity.COSTS OF PHENOTYPE AND COSTS OF PLASTICITYAt the outset, it is critical to distinguish between costs of phenotypesand costs of plasticity (Callahan et al., 2008), which are oftenconfounded in discussion of costs in the evolutionary literature.A cost of plasticity refers to the fitness decrement a highly plasticgenotype pays relative to a less plastic genotype (DeWitt et al., 1998),thus the evolution of plasticity may be constrained by the cost function(Pigiucci, 2001). A cost of phenotype refers in part to the fitness trade-offs inherent in allocating resources to one trait vs another as well asthe costs of obtaining information on the environment (Callahanet al., 2008). Consider the facultative production of a head spine inDaphnia in response to chemicals emitted by predators (kairomones).Suppose the Daphnia population consists of three genotypes: genotype1 constitutively produces short spines (G1 fixed 200 μm spines legendFigure 1), genotype 2 constitutively produces long spines (G2 fixed800 μm spines legend Figure 1) and genotype 3 produces a short spine(200 μm spines) in the absence of predator cues, but a long spine(800 μm spines) in their presence (thus, G3 has plastic spine lengthchanging from 200 to 800 μm between environments, legendFigure 1). In an environment with no predators, genotype 1 hashigher fitness than genotype 2; genotype 2 has incurred a phenotypecost (Figure 1), a situation reversed if predators were present. Thus,phenotype costs are genotype specific and environment dependent,that is, they are local costs. In each environment, we can evaluate thecosts and fitness benefits of a particular phenotype in comparison tothose of alternative phenotypes. A plasticity cost ensues in this examplewhen two genotypes produce the same phenotype (for example, longspines 800 μm; Figure 1), but the more plastic genotype 3 has reducedfitness compared with the non-plastic long-spined genotype 2. Ifplasticity per se is costly this should be detectable even when theplasticity is not elicited (that is, in the no-predator treatment). Thus,costs of plasticity are genotype specific and global, that is, they exist inall environments. Note that plastic genotypes may also incur pheno-type costs in situations where phenotypes are sub-optimal. Ourexample employs perfect symmetry in the fitness responses forsimplicity of presentation. Many biological examples may be morecomplicated as in the case when fitnesses between the plastic andconstitutive genotypes differ. In this scenario, the cost of plasticity (asdescribed) and the cost of phenotype (the average of the fitnessdifferences of G1 and G2 if the fitnesses are not equivalent in eitherenvironment) may both be playing a constraining role in the evolutionof plasticity. Local costs of plasticity must be contextualized across themultiple environments in which selection on plasticity operates: thus,the net effects of costs and benefits will depend on the specificenvironments that the organism encounters. We distinguish thesecosts from limits of plasticity. Together, we consider costs ofphenotype, cost of plasticity and limits to plasticity to be constraintson the evolution of plasticity.CONDITIONS THAT FAVOR PLASTICITYAdaptive phenotypic plasticity is presumed to evolve in response tocontrasting selection pressures that arise when organisms confrontenvironmental heterogeneity (Bradshaw, 1965). Since Bradshaw’sdiscussion, numerous models of the evolution of phenotypic plasticityindicate that plasticity is favored in heterogeneous environmentswhere different phenotypic optima are present across environmentsexperienced either within the lifetime of an organism or acrossgenerations (for example, Berrigan and Scheiner, 2004). Empiricalevidence continues to accumulate demonstrating that heterogeneity innatural landscapes favors plasticity (for example, van Buskirk, 2002)but there is also the potential for variation in local environments todestabilize homeostasis of development and consequently disrupt theFigure 1 Classic framework for evaluating cost of plasticity, and contrastwith a cost of phenotype. In each environment (no predator vs predator),genotypes 1 (G1) and 2 (G2) differ in the phenotypes (200 vs 800 μm) theyproduce, leading to differences in fitness—these represent costs toproducing one phenotype rather than the other. In the predator environment,genotypes 2 (G2) and 3 (G3) both produce the same 800 μm phenotype yetdiffer in fitness. As genotype 3 is plastic, this represents a cost of plasticity.Costs and limits of plasticityCJ Murren et al294Hereditymatch between an organism’s phenotype and environment (Whitmanand Agrawal, 2009). The reliability of environmental cues is of criticalimportance for plasticity to be favored within and across generations(Scheiner and Holt, 2012). With reliable cues and machinery to sensethe environment, phenotypic plasticity can reduce mismatches, andthereby enhance fitness (Getty, 1996).Although the importance of environmental heterogeneity is known,relative environmental frequencies are rarely estimated (althoughlarge-scale studies are emerging, for example, Fournier-Level et al.,2011). The relative frequency of each environment and the overalldiversity of environments experienced (in space and time) will shapethe speed and likelihood of the evolution of adaptive reaction norms(for example, Sultan and Spencer, 2002; Scheiner, 2013). Our under-standing of the importance of environmental novelty or rarity datesback to initial models of the evolution of plasticity that suggest thatrarity strongly influences evolution of plasticity (for example, Levins,1968; Via and Lande, 1985). For populations that experience rare ornovel environments, plastic responses can have two important effects:they may move populations closer to the new phenotypic optimumand they may uncover phenotypic variation (cryptic genetic variation),influencing both intensity and response to selection (Chevin et al.,2010; 2008). Each effect is fundamentally interesting and of particularcontemporary importance in terms of predicting organismal responsesto global change (Quintero and Wiens, 2013). Such conditions thatfavor plasticity are widely discussed and form a foundation for ourdiscussion of constraints.CONSTRAINTS ON PLASTICITYLimited genetic variationUnder conditions in which plasticity is favored, an evolutionaryresponse via phenotypic plasticity can be hindered by a lack of geneticvariation (for example, through small population size or genetic drift),extensive gene flow and genetic correlation between genes for one traitand genes for plasticity of another trait. A lack of genetic variation orcontinued mixing can limit phenotypic evolution and evolution ofplasticity (Schlichting and Pigliucci, 1998). What is novel in con-temporary studies is that our knowledge of fine scale information onraw genetic variation and population genomic information is growingexponentially.Many quantitative genetic studies suggest limited genetic variationfor phenotypic plasticity compared with that for other phenotypictraits. However, in a recent meta-analysis designed to evaluatecomponents of the reaction norm that differ between closely relatedpairs of species or populations demonstrated significantly greaterevolution of plasticity (slope and curvature) than for mean trait values(Murren et al., 2014). This suggests that aspects of plasticity frequentlyevolve. Comparisons between environmental sensory networks ofclosely related populations (Tsuji et al., 2011; Long et al., 2013) offerevidence that novel genetic variation may be present in many systems—suggesting organisms frequently overcome such limits to plasticity.Relaxed and variable selectionIn the absence of continued environmental variation driving selectionfor plasticity, mutation accumulation and selection may erodeplasticity (Maughan et al., 2007; Kvitek and Sherlock, 2013; Leibyand Marx, 2014). Selection that is not absent but relatively weakpurifying or positive selection (relaxed selection) is also thought to bean important constraint in the evolution of plasticity (Snell-Roodet al., 2010). Relative to a specialist, a plastic generalist will experienceless effective selection on developmental pathways specific to the rangeof environments they experience. When gene expression is specific todifferent environments (for example, Aubin-Horth and Renn, 2009), aspecialist in one environment will purge deleterious mutations and fixbeneficial mutations faster than a generalist, which experiencesmultiple environments (for example, Kawecki, 1994). The constraintsimposed by relaxed selection are well established in the theoreticalliterature where specialists will often out-compete plastic generalists,but there are few data sets directly testing this idea. Genes specific toenvironmentally induced morphs in social insects and beetles showgreater evolutionary divergence, consistent with weakened selectionunder conditions where the alternative morph is favored (Snell-Roodet al., 2011). Furthermore, some of these morph-specific genes showgreater genetic variation, consistent with mutation accumulation dueto less effective selection, although in some cases, strong sexualselection may offset this pattern (Kijimoto et al., 2014). Althoughthere is strong theoretical evidence for relaxed selection on alternativedevelopmental pathways, it is possible that the environment-specificgene expression assumed in these models is rare (for example, Snell-Rood et al., 2010) because of weakened selection on alternatedevelopmental pathways. Emerging genomic data will clarify themechanisms underlying plasticity and give insights to the degree ofenvironment-specific expression and the likelihood of this weakenedselection as a constraint on the evolution of plasticity.Variation in the strength of selection across organisms, traits andgenerations can also influence the evolution of plasticity. In experi-mental evolution studies, the nature of variation in the selectiveenvironment influences the evolution of plasticity (that is, generalistsvs specialists). Recent empirical studies have contrasted environmentsthat differ in the scale of variation: coarse-grained environments,which are stable over the lifetime of an organism vs fine-grainedenvironments, which are variable within an organism’s lifetime (forexample, Levins, 1968). Such comparisons of coarse- and fine-grainedresponses may be particularly informative to understanding the limitsof the evolution of plasticity in organisms known to evolve over shorttimescales. Model systems to study plasticity over short timescalesinclude invasive species (Ghalambor et al., 2007) and species exposedto anthropogenic contaminants (Hua et al., 2013).Costs of plasticityOne potential character of universal relevance to both costs ofplasticity or phenotype may be the costs associated with carryingaround additional genetic machinery (Knight et al., 2005). One way ofassessing this is through evaluating genome size. Indeed, evidencesuggests that reduced genome size per se may be a target of selectionfor shorter generation times (for example, Price et al., 1980), and therepeated evolution of aneuploidization and variation in transposableelement load suggests that removal of particular non-coding geneticmaterial may have fitness benefits (for example, Hu et al., 2011).However, the costs of carrying unexpressed genes or additionalregulatory elements is likely negligible in most cases—Latta et al.(2012) reported results of comparisons of expression plasticity of over900 genes in response to salinity differences for both specialist (narrowtolerance) and generalist (plastic, broad tolerance) Daphnia genotypes.They found no differences between genotypes for three measures ofcost: amount of transcription, protein length or ATP production.We anticipate that costs of plasticity are generally negligible for themajority of organisms (that is, the fitness cost of the regulatory geneticmachinery will typically be small), although for organisms with largerbrains or sophisticated immune responses, costs of maintenance maybecome considerable (see Snell-Rood (2012) and discussion below ondevelopmental selection in animals). Important avenues of research inthe costs of plasticity remain. Employing theoretical approaches, weCosts and limits of plasticityCJ Murren et al295Heredityurge consideration of alternatives to quantitative genetics models (seeAuld et al. (2010) for cautionary use of this model; further examina-tions of the limits of the model are developed in a companionmanuscript, Schlichting et al. in preparation). Empirical approachesshould take advantage of modern genomics and other ‘omics tools,particularly those which hold promise to disentangle the costs ofplasticity from the costs of phenotype, and those which evaluatemolecular machinery and regulation of plasticity and phenotypes.Together, these remain important avenues of research on theconstraints of evolution of plasticity.Experimental evolution can be used to directly assess costs ofplasticity by looking for evidence of selection against plasticity: in astable environment, selection should operate to reduce any plasticitythat is inherently costly (Hall and Colegrave, 2008). Maughan et al.(2007) used this approach to examine costs of plasticity in thebacterium Bacillus subtilis. They documented the evolutionary loss ofsporulation ability—a plastic response by some bacterial species tolow-resource status—in an experiment with no selection for sporula-tion spanning 6000 generations. If costs of plasticity are significant,selection should drive the loss of sporulation ability; alternatively,sporulation ability could be lost via mutational degradation. Maselet al. (2007) showed that, in general, mutational degradation is a moreimportant limit for rarely used plasticity whenever the functionalmutation rate is greater than the selective coefficient. By directlymeasuring the functional mutation rate, Maughan et al. (2007) wereable to predict how long until plasticity should be lost in the absenceof costs, and compare this prediction to the observed rate of loss. Allfive populations lost plasticity, but four out of five showed nodetectable cost, leaving only a single instance of selective loss thatcould also be explained by hitchhiking. Thus, costs of plasticity do notappear to limit the maintenance of plasticity in B. subtilis in a constantlow-resource environment. Similar results were found for carbonusage in E. coli, where loss of plasticity was tightly correlated withmutation rate (Leiby and Marx, 2014). However, Kvitek and Sherlock(2013) found that many mutations to three growth control signalingnetworks in S. cerevisiae were adaptive in a constant environment.Although this last result is consistent with a cost of plasticity viaregulatory sensing, it is also consistent with explanations that invoke acost of a phenotype.It may be informative to consider efforts to use experimentalevolution approaches to test costs of plasticity together with growingtheory on relaxed selection. Unfortunately, such empirical approachesrequire organisms that can be maintained under selection forhundreds or thousands of generations; such organisms may be theleast likely to possess significant costs of plasticity. Possible tests mightbe made comparing laboratory strains of Drosophila (or other long-used laboratory animals or livestock) grown for generations in benignenvironments with their counterparts in nature, to evaluate evidencefor reduction of costs of plasticity under relaxed selection. However,even in experimentally tractable systems, disentangling global costs ofplasticity from local costs of phenotype remains a challenge.Are the costs of phenotype and costs of plasticity for some complexcharacters inherently conflated?For some forms of plasticity, costs of phenotype and costs of plasticitymay be difficult to differentiate. In some cases, the costs of phenotypemay be inherent in the costs of the ability to be plastic such as learningand acquired immunity in animals. Selective processes in developmentare costly particularly because a range of phenotypes are sampledduring the developmental learning period and their performanceevaluated through interactions with the environment (Snell-Rood,2012). Phenotype sampling of such an animal generalist takes moretime and energy relative to a specialist (for example, Laverty andPlowright, 1988), resulting in temporary phenotype–environmentmismatches (for example, the cost of naïveté; Dukas, 1998). Inaddition, information processing also requires additional investmentin certain traits, for example, in larger costly brains (Laughlin et al.,1998). These costs of plasticity related to developmental selection canresult in various trade-offs with allocation to reproduction or othertissues (for example, Isler and van Schaik, 2006). Regardless, learning-like mechanisms of plasticity may be truly special in that they comewith clear costs and trade-offs.Although important insights into costs have been uncovered withrespect to learning, similar developmental costs should apply to anyselective processes in development, such as clonal selection in thedevelopment of antibodies (vertebrate acquired immunity) or varia-bility in gene expression and epigenetic stabilization of particularexpression patterns (see Snell-Rood, 2012). In other types of organ-isms or traits, the constraints to plasticity can be more clearlyevaluated as two distinct phenotypes: an environmental sensorymachinery phenotype and a morphological or other focal phenotypictrait of interest. Such a perspective recasts the cost of plasticity as alocalized cost of phenotype.OPPORTUNITIES TO OFFSET COSTSLifespan and ontogenyThe developmental perspectives of Schlichting and Pigliucci (1998)and West-Eberhard (2003) have emphasized the importance ofvariation in responses to the environment throughout time, asselection on traits may vary throughout ontogeny (Figure 2) or asenvironments vary (for example, via physiological traits). The evolu-tion of plasticity may be limited by opportunities to offset early costs(both phenotypic and plastic) later in life. These limits may be throughaltering compensation, redundancy or lag time (Sultan and Spencer2002) and opportunities may vary with lifespan, life history andwhether an organism has a final adult form. Modular organisms (suchas plants and marine invertebrates) may compensate through theflexible addition of new modules, in conditions where a benefit wouldbe realized through such investment. Organisms with determinategrowth may be more likely to rely on other types of traits, such asbehavior or have additional upfront costs of investing in plasticity.Figure 2 Developmental timepoint and impacts on evaluation of costs. Forlearning-like mechanisms of plasticity, performance varies over developmentas several phenotypes are expressed and the optimal phenotype is graduallyadopted. Because performance varies over time, the developmentaltimepoint at which phenotype costs are measured can have a major impacton their interpretation. A specialist (dashed line) has a fixed performancethat is higher in environmental one. The non-plastic generalist (solid line)has the same performance in both environments. The plastic genotype(dotted line) varies performance throughout developmental time. Thus,relative performance of the plastic and specialist genotypes may vary throughdevelopmental time or across environments.Costs and limits of plasticityCJ Murren et al296HeredityFurther examination of how developmental variation limits theevolution of plasticity through experiments that contrast fitnesscomponents at different stages of development will help in under-standing the mechanisms of compensation.Amelioration of costs of phenotypesAlthough models describing the evolution of plasticity assume a costof plasticity must exist, we hypothesize that the cost of phenotypeproduction may ultimately be more important in constraining theevolution of adaptive plasticity. However, over time strong selectionmay cause phenotypic costs to be reduced. This may take severalforms: co-option of existing genetic machinery, compensatory muta-tions or evolution of novel genetic networks. One example ofamelioration via compensatory mutation from single-celled organismsconsiders how yeast responds plastically to the availability of galactose(an environmentally variable resource) via upregulation of the GALgenes (with both metabolic and environmental sensory functions) formetabolizing galactose. The ancestral GAL1/3 gene product has twofunctions (Hittinger and Carroll, 2007): metabolize galactose andregulate transcription factors that lead to increased expression of GALgenes. GAL1/3 expression is constitutively low even when no galactoseis present—that is, this ancestral gene does not respond to environ-mental variation in galactose. The cost of expression via GAL1/3 is aphenotypic cost that has been reduced in Saccharomyces evolution viagene duplication and subfunctionalization, which created two specia-lized genes. GAL3 is optimized for regulatory function with low levelsof expression weakly tuned to galactose levels. GAL1 is optimized formetabolic function with much higher plastic levels of expression thatdepend strongly on regulatory signals. Thus, the evolutionary changethat resulted in two genes with separate regulatory/environmentalsensory and metabolic functions is one piece of evidence of reducedcosts. The phenotype cost of low but constitutive expression of theoptimized GAL3 is likely to be lower than the cost via constitutiveexpression of the ancestral gene GAL1/3 (Hittinger and Carroll, 2007).Such a division of labor among gene copies, separating responses todifferent cues, was proposed by Smith (1990) as a fundamental way ofdiversifying plastic responses, and may be a general solution toreducing the phenotypic costs associated with a lack of specificity ofresponse (contrasting a gene always on GAL1/3, to one that isenvironmentally regulated GAL3). As data on gene expression patternsfor closely related species are rapidly becoming available, the evolu-tionary history of changes in gene interactions and identification of co-option of function of existing regulatory sequences may lead to furtherinsights into the evolution of novel plastic responses and these types ofcomparisons in multicellular organisms are encouraged.van Noordwijk and de Jong (1986) demonstrated that life historytrade-offs may be masked by condition-dependence of resourceacquisition and allocation. We refer to this hypothesis as thecondition-dependence hypothesis (see also Buchanan et al., 2013). Itis also similar to Zahavi’s (1975) handicap hypothesis for the evolutionof elaborate male sexual traits. Such resource-based limits may beindications of costs of phenotype rather than costs of plasticity—as thecosts are local and variation uncovered only in certain cases, andameliorated in others. For example, Cothran et al. (2012) found thatunder low-resource environments where there was also an absence ofpredators, only some males were able to produce large sexual traits,but in resource-rich environments all males produce these traits.Further empirical investigations are warranted to determine therelative importance or sets of conditions where a condition-dependence hypothesis or relaxed selection will operate. For instance,will costs of plasticity be more apparent if we account for variationacross genotypes in aspects of costs of phenotype such as ability toacquire and assimilate resources?MOVING FORWARDIn reality, dissecting the genetic and epigenetic differences even amongthe three heuristic genotypes in Figure 1 may be a complex endeavor.However, new tools combined with classic methods in genetics andecology will provide novel insights into the mechanisms behinddifferential performance of genotypes across environments. Below,we highlight potentially fruitful lines of inquiry. These recommenda-tions include placing plasticity studies more securely within ecologicaland phylogenetic contexts, as well as employing simulation and ‘omicstechniques to test hypotheses of reaction norm evolution.Ecological contextA comprehensive approach to the study of plasticity includes theunderstanding of the adaptive nature of plasticity, whether there isheritable and ontogenetic variation of plastic responses withinpopulations, and detailed knowledge of environments and their spatialand temporal frequencies (for example, Scheiner, 2013). Coordinatedassessment of all these has been achieved in few systems. Thedocumentation of environmental variation was historically a centralarea of research, and evaluating how well experimental environmentsmimic or simulate natural environments, particularly the relativefrequency of each component of the environment, is still relevanttoday in assessing variation in evolutionary responses among popula-tions (for example, Jacobs and Latimer, 2012).The first obstacle to simulating the various abiotic dimensions ofnatural environmental variation under controlled conditions is thedifficulty of quantifying fine- vs coarse-grained environmental varia-tion in nature. Such efforts typically require long-term monitoring ofconditions at the landscape scale. However, some abiotic measure-ments are becoming a more straightforward endeavor using monitor-ing equipment, and will proliferate as technology and access toweather and climate data continue to improve (for example, throughNOAA: http://www.climate.gov/#dataServices; National EcologicalObservation Network: http://www.neoninc.org). Similar efforts arealso needed to obtain information on biotic environmental variation(that is, species interactions; Agrawal et al., 2007), which in many casesmay be more challenging data to collect than abiotic environmentalvariation. Such data have been collected in some exemplary studies(for example, Werner et al., 2007), and advances in technologyfacilitate gathering biotic environmental variation for specific typesof organisms (for example, remote sensing for vegetation).Data on environmental variation and frequencies are also essentialto experimental efforts to examine relaxed selection (Snell-Rood et al.,2010), to understand apparent patterns of selection on functional traits(Stinchcombe et al., 2012) or to forecast the likelihood of populations’evolutionary potential to match with rates of climate change (Quinteroand Wiens, 2013). Quantifying environmental frequency and novelty(outside the typical range) will allow experiments to assess hiddenreaction norms and contribute to a predictive theory of plasticresponses (Snell-Rood, 2012; Hua et al., 2013). For example, arecertain types of traits unlikely to respond appropriately to novelenvironments, revealing particular limits to plasticity? Experiments inarrays of environments may be able to generate data to successfullyevaluate this important environmentally based limit of plasticity, andwill simultaneously be of interest to applied ecologists managingpopulations.Costs and limits of plasticityCJ Murren et al297HeredityPhylogenetic context and comparisons of closely related speciesThe ability to reconstruct evolutionary histories of traits and theirplasticities is essential for understanding apparent limits to plasticity.Analyses of phenotypic responses of closely related species within agenus (Wund et al. 2008), or by employing a phylogeneticallyinformed context, provide key information on the importance ofboth the evolution of phenotypic plasticity as a trait as well as theimportance of phenotypic plasticity as a mechanism of diversification.Exemplary studies include comparison of physiological responses tolight environments of 16 species in the plant genus Psychotria(Valladares et al., 2000), and of polyphenisms in response to foodavailability for example spadefoot toads (Ledon-Rettig et al., 2008).Comparative (phylogenetic) approaches to the study of phenotypecosts and genetic basis of plasticity may be more feasible from bothgenomic and phenotypic perspectives, thanks to advances in next-generation sequencing. Building data sets that combine genomic,phylogenetic and plasticity perspectives will be instrumental indeveloping a more complete picture of the evolution of plasticity.Such combined data sets will allow evaluation of aspects of evolu-tionary history, environment or genetic/genomic combinations thathave contributed to situations where evolution of plasticity may bepromoted or inhibited (Gompert et al., 2014).SimulationModeling offers significant advantages for allowing us to understandhow various factors might restrain evolution under a wide range ofpotential scenarios that might be difficult or impossible to experi-mentally manipulate. For example, in early investigations of thiscomponent of theory on phenotypic plasticity, van Tienderen (1991)compared non-plastic specialists and plastic generalists, exposingpopulations to selection while varying the strength of limits toplasticity. He delimited a parameter space where plastic generalistshave an unequivocal advantage over non-plastic generalists, and otherregions with more complex and contingent evolutionary dynamics.From van Tienderen’s evolutionary modeling work, additional statis-tical procedures employing regression models were developed andadapted (for example, DeWitt et al., 1998). From this statisticalframework, Auld et al. (2010) ran simulations to gain insight into howtraditional regression analyses for costs of plasticity for multiplegenotypes can lead to biased conclusions whenever there are strongcorrelations between the magnitudes of a trait and its plasticity. Othersimulations have highlighted how maternal effects plasticity can alterperformance in later generations (van den Heuvel et al., 2013), howplasticity allows individuals to improve fitness at the edges of thespecies’ distribution while maximizing their fitness in the core(Pichancourt and van Klinken, 2012), and how unreliable environ-mental signals can favor the evolution of a population containingindividuals that do and do not respond to the signal in a probabilisticmanner (Arnoldini et al., 2012). Both models of plasticity evolutionand statistical procedures for evaluating costs and environmentalvariation merit additional attention.‘omics’ approachesAs sequencing of whole genomes is increasingly employed for modeland non-model organisms, the ability to evaluate reaction norms viatranscriptomes, proteomes or metabolomes has arrived (Renn andSchumer, 2013; Grishkevich and Yanai, 2013). Our understanding ofplasticity can be shaped by new tools and approaches including: (a)the ‘omic basis of phenotypes and plastic responses, (b) comparativegenomics of the evolution of plastic responses, (c) epigeneticcomponents of inheritance that may influence plastic responses(Glastad et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2013), including the role ofmethylation and metabolic syndromes in predictive adaptive responses(Richards et al., 2010).As ‘omics data accumulate, the matching data on phenotypes aretypically lacking (White et al., 2012). Acquisition of extensivephenotypic data (phenomics) is now becoming a priority (Kuhl andBurghardt, 2013). Combining genomic and phenomic data, newbioinformatic and statistical tools, and clever experimental design willpermit evaluation of the relative influences of genetic, environmentaland epigenetic variation and further insights into the potentialconstraints to plasticity.Understanding the genetic basis and allelic variation of traits andplasticity within and among populations for a broad set of biologicalsystems can aid in uncovering critical constraints. For example, is alack of genetic variation a fundamental limit to plasticity? Are therecritical associations of particular aspects of genetic architecture andplastic traits? Do plasticity genes belong to particular gene ontologyclasses? In microbes, evolve-and-resequence approaches can be power-ful (Kvitek and Sherlock, 2013). In sexual populations, genome-wideassociation studies (GWAS) allow the investigation of associationsbetween single-nucleotide polymorphism and traits of interest. Forexample, in Arabidopsis thaliana, the adaptive plastic response of shadeavoidance (increased hypocotyl length) was examined through GWASuncovering known, de novo candidates and regions associated withgenotype by environment interactions (Filiault and Maloof, 2012).Expanding from GWAS to phenotypic screens of mutant libraries(such as T-DNA mutants; O’Malley and Ecker, 2010; Murren, 2012)across environments will provide large phenotypic data sets toinvestigate questions of how particular genes influence plasticresponses. As analytical tools in genomics and statistical informaticsproliferate, there is promise of critical advances in our understandingof the limits of phenotypic plasticity (Table 1).In tandem with basic research, applied evolutionary studies inagriculture (Vigueira et al., 2013), fisheries (Bradbury et al., 2013),conservation biology (Richards et al., 2006) and human health (Lowet al., 2012) will provide new opportunities to examine the limits ofplasticity from ecological genomic or epigenomic perspectives. Systemsbiology perspectives that scale from DNA to RNA to protein informhow intermediate traits (for example, RNA expression) may influencedownstream traits and may further our conceptualization of plasticityand opportunities to offset costs and limits of plasticity. Investigationsof a diversity of species that vary in mating system, geographic extent,habitat heterogeneity, and diversity of subspecies or landraces will becritically informative to examining evolution of the limits of plasticityover short timescales.These new and growing knowledge bases together with carefullyplanned theoretical and empirical approaches such as Maughan et al.(2007) efforts to evaluate costs of plasticity or Snell-Rood et al. (2010)efforts to evaluate relaxed selection, offer the opportunity to shed newlight on the constraints on plasticity evolution.CONCLUSIONSOur ability to develop robust theories of the evolution of plasticityrequires further research on both the constraints and benefits ofplasticity across systems. We advocate evaluating systems to examinethe relative contributions of relaxed selection, variable selection andcosts of plasticity on constraints on the evolution of phenotypicplasticity by employing both classical and new tools. We hypothesizethat costs of phenotype and limits to plasticity outweigh costs ofplasticity in many systems and warrant specific formalization in thatcontext, yet animals that employ learning and single-celled organismsCosts and limits of plasticityCJ Murren et al298Heredityin constant environments may be special cases where costs may bedetected. Even in these systems, costs of plasticity and costs ofphenotype must be clearly and separately evaluated, and may oftenbe difficult to differentiate. Costs and limits may be offset over thelifetime of an organism or in certain ecologies, thus developmentaland ecological perspectives will shed new light on the response oforganisms to heterogeneous landscapes.Efforts to understand limits to ability of organisms to deployappropriate plasticity have become more urgent in the face ofpervasive and rapid environmental change such as habitat fragmenta-tion, influx of invasive species and global climate change, in additionto human urban systems and understanding transmission of disease,and developing of agricultural methods and genotypes with reducedecological footprints. Recent decades of research have amassedsubstantial data on the nature of plasticity and demonstrated that itis of fundamental importance in biological systems (for example,Pigiucci, 2001; West-Eberhard, 2003). The broad question of howgeneralists and specialists differ across environments, through devel-opment, and over evolutionary history remains central to under-standing evolution in changing environments.CONFLICT OF INTERESTThe authors declare no conflict of interest.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThis work was supported by the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center(NESCent), NSF #EF-0423641 for a working group (project leaders: CJM andCDS) and a short-term fellowship to CJM.

Whether or not environmentally induced phenotypes are sufficiently recurrent and fit to leave a signature in adaptive evolution is debated. Here, we analyze multivariate data from 34 plant reciprocal transplant studies to test: (1) if plasticity is an adaptive source of developmental bias that makes locally adapted populations resemble the environmentally induced phenotypes of ancestors; and (2) if plasticity, standing phenotypic variation and genetic divergence align during local adaptation. Phenotypic variation increased marginally in foreign environments but, as predicted, the direction of ancestral plasticity was generally well aligned with the phenotypic difference between locally adapted populations, making plasticity appear to """"take the lead"""" in adaptive evolution. Plastic responses were sometimes more extreme than the phenotypes of locally adapted plants, which can give the impression that plasticity and evolutionary adaptation oppose each other; however, environmentally induced and locally adapted phenotypes were rarely misaligned. Adaptive fine‐tuning of phenotypes—genetic accommodation—did not fall along the main axis of standing phenotypic variation or the direction of plasticity, and local adaptation did not consistently modify the direction or magnitude of plasticity. These results suggest that plasticity is a persistent source of developmental bias that shapes how plant populations adapt to environmental change, even when plasticity does not constrain how populations respond to selection",,info:eu-repo/semantics/article,"PE&RC, Mathematical and Statistical Methods - Biometris, P-matrix, adaptive plasticity, evolvability, genetic accommodation, phenotypic accommodation, phenotypic plasticity, plants, plasticity-led evolution, reciprocal transplant, PE&RC, Wiskundige en Statistische Methoden - Biometris",,'Wiley'
phenotypic plasticity hypothesis,211225931,Data from: Adaptive phenotypic plasticity for life-history and less fitness-related traits,10.5061/dryad.72s8g4j,"Acasuso-Rivero, Cristina, Steiner, Ulrich Karl, Murren, Courtney, Schlichting, Carl",2019,"Organisms are faced with variable environments and one of the most common solutions to cope with such variability is phenotypic plasticity, a modification of the phenotype to the environment. These modifications are commonly modelled in evolutionary theories as adaptive, influencing ecological and evolutionary processes. If plasticity is adaptive, we would predict that the closer to fitness a trait is, the less plastic it would be. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a meta-analysis of 213 studies and measured the plasticity of each reported trait as a coefficient of variation (CV). Traits were categorised as closer to fitness - life-history traits (LHt) including reproduction and survival related-traits, and farther from fitness - non-life-history traits (N-LHt) including traits related to development, metabolism and physiology, morphology and behaviour. Our results showed, unexpectedly, that although traits differed in their amounts of plasticity, trait plasticity was not related to its proximity to fitness. These findings were independent of taxonomic groups or environmental types assessed. We caution against general expectations that plasticity is adaptive, as assumed by many models of its evolution. More studies are needed that test the adaptive nature of plasticity, and additional theoretical explorations on adaptive and non-adaptive plasticity are encouraged",,"Life sciences, medicine and health care","Life sciences, medicine and health care",,

However this tradition relies also upon a genetic conception of plasticity. Founded upon the concepts of """"phenotypic plasticity"""" and """"reaction norm,"""" this genetic conception focuses on the array of possible phenotypic change in relation to diversified environments. Another concept of plasticity can be found in recent publications by some developmental biologists (Gilbert, West-Eberhard). I argue that these authors adopt a """"broad conception of plasticity"""" that is closely related to a notion of development as something that is ongoing throughout an organism's lifecycle, and has no clear-cut boundaries. However, I suggest that given a narrow conception of plasticity, one can define temporal boundaries for development that are linked to specific features of the morphological process, which are different from behavioral and physiological processes",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/article, Journal articles","Development, EvoDevo, Modern synthesis, Morphogenesis, Norm of reaction, Phenotypic plasticity, Plasticity, Wallace’s challenge, [SHS.HISPHILSO]Humanities and Social Sciences/History, Philosophy and Sociology of Sciences",,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC'
phenotypic plasticity hypothesis,534125203,Phenotypic plasticity and the leaf economics spectrum: plasticity is positively associated with specific leaf area,10.1111/oik.09342,"Stotz, Gisela C., Salgado-Luarte, Cristian, Escobedo, Víctor M., Valladares Ros, Fernando, Gianoli, Ernesto",2022,"Phenotypic  plasticity  is  a  key  mechanism  by  which  plants  respond  to  changing  or  heterogeneous conditions. Efforts to predict phenotypic plasticity across plant species have  mainly  focused  on  environmental  variability  or  abiotic  conditions,  i.e.  site  characteristics.  However,  the  considerable  variation  in  phenotypic  plasticity  within  sites calls for alternative approaches. Different functional groups are thought to differ in their plasticity levels. Further, traits such as leaf specific area (SLA), leaf area (LA) and  maximum  photosynthetic  rate  (Amax)  reflect  central  aspects  of  plant  strategies.  Lower  values  of  SLA,  LA  and  Amax  are  indicative  of  a  resource-conservative  strategy,  which  is  thought  to  be  associated  with  lower  phenotypic  plasticity.  We  used  meta-analytical  data  to  test  whether  plant  functional  group  (herbs,  woody  deciduous  and  woody evergreens) and SLA, LA and Amax are associated with phenotypic plasticity in four  trait  types:  biomass  allocation,  plant  size,  leaf  morphology  and  physiology.  We  obtained data from 168 plant species and accounted for phylogenetic relationships in all analyses. We found a positive relationship between SLA and phenotypic plasticity in  biomass  allocation,  leaf  morphology  and  physiology,  with  differences  across  functional groups. In contrast, there was no evidence of greater plasticity in plant size in  species  with  higher  SLA;  rather  the  opposite  was  true  for  woody  evergreens.  Amaxand LA showed similar, but less consistent associations with phenotypic plasticity. Our results show the potential of building predictive frameworks for phenotypic plasticity based on easily measured plant functional characteristics. Results also provide insights into  plant  strategies  and  suggest  the  existence  of  potential  compromises:  resource-conservative,  low-SLA  species  tend  to  be  more  stress-tolerant  but  may  be  less  able  to  cope  with  variable  conditions  due  to  their  generally  lower  phenotypic  plasticity.  Further studies are needed to explore the mechanisms and the potential implications of this association.GCS was supported by ANID through the FONDECYT Iniciación grant 11220233.

phenotypic plasticity hypothesis,212334025,Does plasticity enhance or dampen phenotypic parallelism? A test with three lake-stream stickleback pairs,10.1111/jeb.12767,"Oke, K.B., Bukhari, M., Kaeuffer, R., Rolhausen, G., Räsänen, K., Bolnick, D.I., Peichel, Catherine, Hendry, A.P.",2016,"Parallel (and convergent) phenotypic variation is most often studied in the wild, where it is difficult to disentangle genetic vs. environmentally induced effects. As a result, the potential contributions of phenotypic plasticity to parallelism (and nonparallelism) are rarely evaluated in a formal sense. Phenotypic parallelism could be enhanced by plasticity that causes stronger parallelism across populations in the wild than would be expected from genetic differences alone. Phenotypic parallelism could be dampened if sitespecific plasticity induced differences between otherwise genetically parallel populations. We used a common-garden study of three independent lake–stream stickleback population pairs to evaluate the extent to which adaptive divergence has a genetic or plastic basis, and to investigate the enhancing vs. dampening effects of plasticity on phenotypic parallelism. We found that lake–stream differences in most traits had a genetic basis, but that several traits also showed contributions from plasticity. Moreover, plasticity was much more prevalent in one watershed than in the other two. In most cases, plasticity enhanced phenotypic parallelism, whereas in a few cases, plasticity had a dampening effect. Genetic and plastic contributions to divergence seem to play a complimentary, likely adaptive, role in phenotypic parallelism of lake–stream stickleback.

To achieve this, we have distinguished between two types of plasticity, an early one that we call 'TEMP' for 'Temperature or Entropy Mediated Plasticity', and another, we call 'canalization', which is close to Hebbian plasticity. These two forms of plasticity can be most easily distinguished by their relationship to 'precision' or inverse variance; TEMP relates to increased model variance or decreased precision, whereas the opposite is true for canalization. TEMP also subsumes increased learning rate, (Ising) temperature and entropy. Dictionary definitions of 'plasticity' describe it as the property of being easily shaped or molded; TEMP is the better match for this. Importantly, we propose that 'pathological' phenotypes develop via mechanisms of canalization or increased model precision, as a defensive response to adversity and associated distress or dysphoria. Our model states that canalization entrenches in psychopathology, narrowing the phenotypic state-space as the agent develops expertise in their pathology. We suggest that TEMP - combined with gently guiding psychological support - can counter canalization. We address questions of whether and when canalization is adaptive versus maladaptive, furnish our model with references to basic and human neuroscience, and offer concrete experiments and measures to test its main hypotheses and implications",,,,,'Elsevier BV'

Of particular interest are individual differences in the temporal plasticity of personality traits over extended (ontogenetic) periods of time, because of the relevance of these data to models of behavioral development. We discuss recent empirical studies of the temporal consistency of personality over ontogeny, and models that make contrasting predictions about individual differences in the developmental trajectories of behavioral traits. In addition, we consider recent advances in studies of relationships between personality traits and particular types of behavioral plasticity, including statistical methods which facilitate analyses of relationships between personality traits, contextual plasticity, temporal plasticity and intraindividual variability, and empirical tests of predicted relationships between personality traits and other types of behavioral plasticity (flexibility, learning rates). As the field of animal personality and behavioral plasticity moves from a largely descriptive to a predictive phase, we suggest that there is ample room for empirical tests of recent models that predict individual differences in behavioral developmental trajectories, and for the development of new formal models that make strong predictions about relationships between personality traits and specific types of behavioral plasticity",,Journal Article,,,'Elsevier BV'

However, properly recorded &quot;PC &quot; pressure pulses did not display the large cyclic pressure variations recorded from the left atrium during mitral stenosis and insufficiency. It is concluded that pressures recorded through a properly wedged catheter represent the constant pulmonary capillary pressure but do not reflect cyclic pressure variations in the left atrium. IN A previous communication1 experimentalevidence was presented that a catheterproperly wedged into a peripheral pulmon-ary artery records a rather constant pressure, generally a little higher than that in the left atrium. Therefore, such pressures can be fairly taken as an index of pulmonary capillary pres-sure (PCP). However, it was questioned whether phasic left atrial pressures can be transmitted through capillaries to such a cath-eter, as others have believed.2&quot;5 Evidence was presented that when phasic systolic variations are recorded through a wedged catheter they are caused by transmission of pulmonary ar-terial pressure to the catheter tip.

Hartmann*,2020,"Abstract  This paper explores a hypothesis that considers the question how pressure may shorten the healing time of a hematoma or contusion. The purpose is to present a mathematical model for predictions based on the hypothesis that can be quantitatively compared to measurements. The time trajectory of the fluid volume in the hematoma is modeled by two rate equations, with rate parameters linked to healing and fluid transfer mechanisms. The flux of fluid leaving the hematoma pocket is assumed to be pressure dependent, consistent with Starling’s principle, which asserts that the flux through a tissue layer is equal to the pressure gradient across the layer multiplied by the tissue hydraulic conductivity. Two contributions to the pressure are skin elasticity and applied compression. Shape measurements on two hematomas were made over the 10-week healing time. Model parameters are in fair agreement with values reported previously for wound contraction speed, tissue hydraulic conductivity, and skin elasticity",,"info:eu-repo/semantics/article, publication-article",Keywords: Starling's principle; Pressure hypothesis; Hematoma; Healing time trajectory.,,

propagule pressure hypothesis,109499052,Pulsatile Flow Patterns in Distensible Tubes,,"E. O. Attinger, H. Sugawara, A. Navarro, A. Anne Ph. D",2016,"• During the last fifty years a number of physical theories have been proposed in an attempt to describe analytically the behavior of pulsatile flow in the mammalian arterial system. In order to make such an approach to a system of nonuniform, viscoelastic vessels containing a non-Newtonian fluid at all possible, it becomes necessary to introduce simplifying assumptions, the judicious selec-tion of which represents one of the most critical points of departure for any analysis and requires considerable insight into bio-logical phenomena. Womersley&apos;s1 theory, al-though similar to those developed earlier by Witzig2 and Lambossy,3 has been the most widely applied because of its refinements and because he provided the tables necessary for a solution of the linearized Navier-Stokes equations with minimal labor. Due mainly to the unavailability of adequate instrumentation for accurate measurement of blood pressure and flow, experimental verifi-cation of these theories and their underlying assumptions has become possible only during recent years. In a careful study,4 comparing experimental data with those predicted by theory, evidence was presented that Womers-ley&apos;s theory underestimates the viscous losses associated with pulsatile blood flow by a factor of three or more. In view of the assumptions underlying the theory, the authors suggested that this discrepancy may be due either to nonlaminar flow characteris-tics or to convective acceleration associate",,text,,,
propagule pressure hypothesis,105990547,Observations on intrapleural pressure and its influence on the relative circulation rate in emphysema,,"B. Kountz, Emmet F. Pearson, Karl F. Koenig",2016,"In considering the relation of circulatory factors to the hemo-respiratory incompetence of emphysema, attention has usually been focused on possible defects in the pulmonary circulation. Less attention has been paid to factors which hinder the return flow of venous blood. Consideration of all the evidence does not seem to justify this emphasis, and the increased intrapleural pressure which has been observed in functional emphysema indicates that the difficulty may arise from changed intrathoracic pressure quite as much as from changes in the lungs themselves. Evidence from experimental data and inferences from a consideration of the pathology of emphysema support the assumption that when there is obstructed expiration the obvious circulatory impairment is due to change in the lesser circulation. Pathologists agree that there is a diminution in the capillary bed in the lungs in emphysema, a fact which has led to the belief that there must be increased resistance to blood flow through the organ. Friedman and Jackson (1) partially obstructed expiration in dogs and found an increase in the carbon dioxide content of the alveolar air and in the blood. They attributed their results to interference of blood flow through the pulmonary capillaries, a condition supposedly resulting because the intrabronchial pressure was greater than the capillary pressure during the expiratory phase. Heinbecker (2) demonstrated that with inflation of the excised lungs of a cat by positive pressure he could decrease the flow of perfused blood. Lichtheim (3) has shown that the pulmonary capillary bed can be greatly diminished by ligation of the pulmonary artery of one lung with no change in the pul-monary blood pressure. Kountz, Alexander and Dowell (4) studied the effect of partial ob-struction of the expiration of dogs over a period of weeks. They found that as the lungs became larger the intrapleural pressure increased and that venous pressure varied directly with the pressure changes in the pleural cavity. These observations point to the possibility that periph",,text,,,
propagule pressure hypothesis,36289897,Preventing pressure ulcers by assessment of the microcirculation in tissue exposed to pressure,10.3384/diss.diva-109960,"Bergstrand, Sara",2014,"The overall aim of this thesis was to combine optical methods into a system with the ability to simultaneously measure blood flow changes at different tissue depths. The goal of such a system was to reveal vascular mechanisms relevant to pressure ulcer etiology under clinically relevant conditions and in relation to the evaluation of pressure-redistribution support surfaces. This thesis consists of four quantitative, cross-sectional studies measuring blood flow responses before, during, and after pressure exposure of the sacral tissue. Two optical methods – photoplethysmography and laser Doppler flowmetry – were combined in a newly developed system that has the ability to discriminate blood flows at different tissue depths. Studies I and II explored blood flow responses at different depths in 17 individuals. In Study I the blood flow was related to tissue thickness and tissue compression during pressure exposure of ≥ 220 mmHg. In Study II, the sacral tissue was loaded with 37.5 mmHg and 50.0 mmHg, and the variation in blood flow was measured. Studies III and IV included 42 healthy individuals &lt; 65 years, 38 healthy individuals ≥ 65 years, and 35 patients ≥ 65 years. Study III included between-subject comparisons of blood flow and pressure between individuals in the three study groups lying in supine positions on a standard hospital mattress. Study IV added within-subject comparisons while the individual was lying on four different types of mattress. The studies explored the vascular phenomena pressure-induced vasodilation (PIV) and reactive hyperemia (RH). The most common blood flow response to tissue exposure in this thesis was PIV, although a decrease in blood flow (a lack of PIV) was observed in some individuals. The patients tended to have higher interface pressure during pressure exposure than the healthy groups but no differences in blood flow responses were seen. Our results showed that pressure levels that are normally considered to be harmless could have a significant effect on the microcirculation in different tissue structures. Differences in individual blood flow responses in terms of PIV and RH were seen, and a larger proportion of individuals lacked these responses in the deeper tissue structures compared to more superficial tissue structures. This thesis identified PIV and RH that are important vascular mechanisms for pressure ulcer development and revealed for the first time that PIV and RH are present at different depths under clinically relevant conditions. The thesis also identified a population of individuals not previously identified who lack both PIV and RH and seem to be particularly vulnerable to pressure exposure. Further, this thesis has added a new perspective to the microcirculation in pressure ulcer etiology in terms of blood flow regulation and endothelial function that are anchored in clinically relevant studies. Finally, the evaluation of pressureredistribution support surfaces in terms of mean blood flow during and after tissue exposure was shown to be unfeasible, but the assessment of PIV and RH could provide a new possibility for measuring individual physiological responses that are known to be related to pressure ulcer development",,"Doctoral thesis, comprehensive summary, info:eu-repo/semantics/doctoralThesis, text","Pressure ulcer, photoplethysmography, laser Doppler flowmetry, non-invasive, tissue blood flow, reactive hyperemia, pressure-induced vasodilation, interface pressure, risk assessment, Nursing, Omvårdnad, Clinical Medicine, Klinisk medicin",,Linköping

To test this hypothesis, we investigated the influence of pat on paCO2, and then assessed the influence of paCO2 on ICP by extrapolating data found in the literature.

propagule pressure hypothesis,105178484,The Dynamics of Pulsatile Blood Flow,,H. Peterson,2016,"The theory of dynamic fluid motion involving the forces manifested by mass, acceleration, viscous friction and vessel wall tension have been considered and studied when arterial blood flow and pres-sure are pulsatile. These studies and considerations have resulted in the conclusion that arterial blood pressure is dependent upon all of these parameters and that the relationship of pressure and flow is more complex and nonlinear than heretofore generally believed. IT is generally held that Poisueille&apos;s lawadequately describes the relationships ofarterial blood pressure and flow. The basic assumptions underlying his law are that there is steady, laminar, parallel, flow of a New-tonion liquid in a straight, smooth walled tube. The arterial blood circulation is pulsatile, the fluid is non-Newtonion and the vessels are of complex geometry and elasticity. Consideration of these discrepancies between idealized and actual conditions leads one to question the usual approach to hemodynamics which linearly relates flow and pressure, and which designates arterial distensibility and vol-ume change as the primary determinants of pulse pressure. In addition to vessel distensibility two other effects must be considered in the case of arte-rial blood flow which accelerates and decel-erates. These are inertia and viscosity which are generally related in a complex manner to distensibility.

A computer model of the cardiopulmonary system was adapted to this problem, relating mechanisms such as baroreflex regulation of heart rate in response to respiratory oscillations. The model provided time-course simulations of hemodynamics by numerically integrating 28 nonlinear, time-varying differential equations. Two approaches for baroreflex regulation were tested, including a simple 1st-order relationship between R-R interval (RRI) and SBP and the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model. Experimental data were obtained retrospectively from 22 patients with chronic airway obstruction before and during breathing through an external resistance. Magnitude and phase relations between arterial pressure and pleural pressure were evaluated.

The diagnosis of PH due to left heart disease relies on a clinical probability assessment followed by the invasive measurements of a mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) ≥25 mm Hg and mean wedged PAP (PAWP) >15 mm Hg. A combination of mean PAP and mean PAWP defines postcapillary PH. Postcapillary PH is generally associated with a diastolic pulmonary pressure gradient (diastolic PAP minus mean PAWP) <7 mm Hg, a transpulmonary pressure gradient (mean PAP minus mean PAWP) <12 mm Hg, and pulmonary vascular resistance ≤3 Wood units (WU). This combination of criteria defines isolated postcapillary PH. Postcapillary PH with elevated vascular gradients and pulmonary vascular resistance defines combined post- and precapillary PH (Cpc-PH). Postcapillary PH is associated with a decreased survival in proportion to increased pulmonary vascular gradients, decreased pulmonary arterial compliance, and reduced right ventricular function. The Cpc-PH subcategory occurs in 12% to 13% of patients with PH due to left heart disease. Patients with Cpc-PH have severe PH, with higher diastolic pulmonary pressure gradient, transpulmonary pressure gradient, and pulmonary vascular resistance and more pronounced ventilatory responses to exercise, lower pulmonary arterial compliance, depressed right ventricular ejection fraction, and shorter life expectancy than isolated postcapillary PH.

A positive correlation between global PALS and PPV was found (R(2) = 0.80, P&lt;0.001). Mean global PALS of 26.2% demonstrated excellent accuracy (Area Under Roc Curve = 0.86, P&lt;0.001), and good sensitivity (92%) and specificity (86%) in predicting a PPV &gt;15%.  CONCLUSION:  In a group of mechanically ventilated patients PPV, derived from pulse contour analysis, and echocardiographic preload parameters were well correlated. Global PALS by STE provided better estimation of PPV than mean E/E' ratio. PALS seems a potential alternative to PPV in assessing fluid responsiveness in critically ill patients. © 2014 Scandinavian Society of Clinical Physiology and Nuclear Medicine.

By definition in Executive Order No. 13112, an “invasive species” is a non-native organism whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic, environmental harm, and/or harm to human health (Exec. Order No. 13112, 1999). Invasive species account for more than $1.4 trillion in annual economic damages on the global scale (Pimentel et al. 2001). In the United States alone, invasive species result in $78.5 billion in economic losses and $58.3 billion in environmental damages (Pimentel et al. 2001). Second to habitat destruction, invasive species have been described as one of the largest global threats to biodiversity (e.g., Glowka et al. 1994, Williamson 1999).  The number and abundance of invasive species have reached increased levels in temperate regions of Europe, North America, and Australia, primarily due to shipping and aquaculture introductions. According to a global assessment of 329 marine species, only 16% of marine ecoregions had no reported non-native species (Molnar et al. 2008). Marine invasive species are identified across many taxa of plants (e.g., Caulerpa taxifolia (seaweed), Codium fragile (“green sea fingers”), Sargassum muticum (Japanese wireweed) (Smith et al. 2002)), vertebrates (e.g., Pterois volitans (red lionfish), Petromyzon marinus (sea lamprey), Gambusia affinis (mosquitofish) (Smith and Tibbles 1980, Albins and Hixon 2008, Cote et al. 2010)), and invertebrates (e.g., Mnemiopsis leidyi (comb jelly), Carcinus maenas (shore crab), Dreissena polymorpha (zebra mussel) (Grosholz and Ruiz 1996, Johnson and Carlton 1996, Shiganova 1998)). For example, Crassostrea gigas (Pacific oyster) has been introduced into more than 45 ecoregions (Molnar et al. 2008). Although oysters yielded an initial economic gain, they caused major ecological damage due to settling in dense aggregations, which limited food and habitat for native species (Eno 1997). Similarly, Mnemiopsis ledyi (comb jelly) has had negative impacts in the Black and Caspian Seas. Specifically, M. ledyi is a predator of zooplankton, pelagic fish eggs, and larvae of anchovy. As a result, biodiversity, abundance, and biomass of the main components of the pelagic zooplankton-ecosystem have sharply decreased since M. ledyi invaded these marine environments (Oguz et al. 2001, Shiganova et al. 2004). Lastly, Eichhornia crassipes, commonly referred to as water hyacinth, has become one of the   2  world’s most prevalent invasive aquatic plants. Dense populations can obstruct phytoplankton production and reduce dissolved oxygen concentrations, which in turn can negatively affect organisms at higher trophic levels (Villamagna and Murphy 2010). Despite the prevalence of invasive species in both marine and terrestrial environments, it is difficult for introduced species to become established, and only a fraction of these become invasive (see below). Invasion can be described as a process of sequential steps or filters that drive the fate of an introduced species. These steps include: (1) vector entrainment, (2) transportation and survival, (3) introduction, (4) establishment, and (5) spread (Carlton 1979, Kolar and Lodge 2001, Miller and Ruiz 2009). According to Kolar and Lodge (2001), vector entrainment is defined as a transport pathway that draws a species from its region of origin and deposits it outside of its native range (Kolar and Lodge 2001). During transportation, a species can either die or survive. Survival determines whether the species will be introduced into a non-native region. At the time of release, the survived species is said to be considered a non-native species (Kolar and Lodge 2001). The second barrier that a species must overcome is establishment. An established population can be defined as one that is unlikely to go extinct in the near future (Drake and Jerde 2009). Within a given time frame, the non-native species becomes established in the non-native region. Interactions with the invaded community then determine how widespread the non-native population will become. Therefore, invasion can be defined as a non-native species that spreads from the point of introduction and becomes abundant, overcoming biotic resistance (Kolar and Lodge 2001). If a non-native species remains localized within a non-native region, it is considered to be a non-invasive species (Kolar and Lodge 2001). According to the “tens rule”, 1-in-10 species imported into non-native areas subsequently appear in the wild, 1-in-10 of those introduced species become established, and 1-in-10 of those established species spread and become invasive (Holdgate 1986, Williamson and Brown 1986, Williamson 1993, Williamson and Fitter 1996, Williamson 1999). Consequently, 99.9% of imported species do not become invasive species. Although this percentage is small, the costs and damages resulting from invasions cannot go unnoticed.  Although the filters of the invasion process have been widely accepted, it is important to understand the underlying mechanisms which result in the development of an   3  invasive species. As a result, a thorough understanding of how these filters operate the invasion process can contribute to current management strategies.   Vectors of Invasion Multiple vectors have been linked to transporting species that have successfully established and become invasive. Shipping vessels, perhaps one of the most contributing vectors for large introduction sizes (i.e. large numbers of individuals) (MacIsaac et al. 2002, Roman and Darling 2007), can transport non-native organisms both on a surface of the hull and via ballast water (Minchin et al. 2009). Thousands of species (Cariton and Geller 1993), ranging from viruses to fish, have been introduced by transportation of ballast water (Minchin et al. 2009). Organisms such as seaweeds, sponges (Porifera), mussels (Bivalvia), and barnacles (Cirripedia) can attach directly to ship hulls. Shipworms (Teredinidae), isopod (Isopoda), and amphipod (Amphipoda) species can attach to wooden hulls. Lastly, infaunal species can take refuge under sediment accumulation in the bottom of ballast tanks (Minchin et al. 2009).  Other vectors that have been associated with the introduction of organisms between different biogeographical regions are canals, aquaculture, commercial fisheries, trade in ornamental species, the use of live organisms as bait, leisure activities and tourism, research and education, as well as habitat restoration/management (Roman and Darling 2007, Minchin et al. 2009). Canals provide a gateway between different regions either by shipping or by organisms themselves passing through the canal (Gollasch et al. 2006, Minchin et al. 2009). Aquaculture alone can introduce species in multiple ways: growing species directly in the environment, intentional releasement (ocean ranching), escaping pens or cages, larvae released through discharges, and transportation accidents (Minchin 2007, Minchin et al. 2009). As a result, introduced organisms can impact native species through competition, and can themselves serve as vectors for parasites and other pathogens (Minchin 2007, Minchin et al. 2009). Commercial fishery projects have deliberately introduced fishes, crustaceans, and mollusks in various non-native regions, which has had negative consequences for native species and habitats. Even non-living fisheries products (fresh or frozen), often used as bait, have the ability to carry pathogens, including viruses (Minchin et al. 2009). Although release of aquarium species is associated with the   4  introduction of few individuals per event, multiple introduction events can result in the establishment of non-native populations (Roman and Darling 2007). Similar to shipping, recreational boating and activities can be a vector source through accumulation of fouling organisms on hulls and equipment. Activities stimulating transportation of non-native organisms include fishing, diving, sailing, wind-surfing, and jet skiing (Minchin et al. 2009). Lastly, research and education institutions can serve as a source of experimental organism release as well as plantings of non-native marine and estuarine angiosperms for habitat restoration purposes. This action can lead to negative impacts on native ecosystems if not properly controlled (Minchin et al. 2009). Importantly, each of these vectors will introduce different numbers of individuals, at different rates, and over different geographical areas. Consequently, the quantitative experimental study of these vectors, and how they influence establishment success, are likely to be challenging, if not impossible, in a natural setting. Nevertheless, broad scale management strategies have been implemented towards reducing the introduction on non-natives into novel environments.   Current Management Strategies  Various vector management strategies have been employed in efforts to prevent establishment of invasive species. The main objectives of these strategies are to prevent the arrival of non-native species as well as to control their transportation with trade, since it is often more difficult to control spread after arrival and establishment (Minchin et al. 2009). Raising public awareness and implementing codes of practice can reduce the risk of introducing non-native species (Minchin et al. 2009). For example, the ICES Code of Practice aims to reduce the spread of non-native species by encouraging countries to implement policies and procedures. For example, member countries are required to provide a detailed proposal for introductions, using internationally recognized protocols for introduction, meeting current commercial practice codes (e.g., the OIE International Aquatic Animal Health Code), and mandatory licensing for releasing genetically modified organisms (including triploid and polyploid organisms) (ICES 2005). Additional governing documents include treaties within the framework of the International Maritime Organization. These treaties outline specific upper limits for total organismal concentrations in ballast water discharge according to size and taxonomic group   5  (International Maritime Organization 2004, Minton et al. 2005). Regulations requiring exchanges of port-loaded water for oceanic water when ships pass over deep water also reduce transportation of non-native species (Minchin et al. 2009). Several countries have required ship arrivals from outside of their Exclusive Economic Zones to perform ballast water exchange in the open ocean (Minton et al. 2005).   One of the best options for inhibiting future invasions is preventing the transport of potential invaders through pre-boarder vector management (Johnston et al. 2009). As previously stated, ballast water and fouling organism transport are two critical vectors that result in marine invasions (Johnston et al. 2009). Therefore, current ballast management strategies have focused targeting the vector rather than individual species. However, characterizing species assemblages in each ballast tank and interpreting the risk associated with each assemblage is impractical (Ruiz and Carlton 2003, Minton et al. 2005). In one study, a model was developed that linked ship transportation to existing hotspots of marine invaders. It was found that reducing individual ship visits was more effective in controlling introduction events compared to eliminating key ports (Drake and Lodge 2004, Johnston et al. 2009). In another study, ballast water exchange was estimated to reduce coastal zooplankton numbers from 107 to 106 organisms (Minton et al. 2005). If management strategies focus on altering ship arrival frequency and discharge volume, the probability of invasive establishment can be significantly reduced. Although an international effort to reduce transportation of non-native species into non-native regions has contributed significantly to the prevention of invasions, a thorough understanding of the dynamics which drive non-native species establishment can provide management with additional insight on implemented policies. In turn, a large scientific effort has been placed on determining which species, or characteristics of organisms, help to promote or detract from establishment and invasion success. This targeted approach has been postulated to be more efficacious at reducing the annual number of introduction events. However, as we will demonstrate below, identifying characteristics associated with establishment success and invasiveness is not complete, and is fraught with challenges.       6  Mechanisms that affect establishment success. Several studies have explored the characteristics that promote establishment success (Veltman et al. 1996, Kolar and Lodge 2001, Forsyth et al. 2004, Davis 2009). Previous studies have suggested that establishment requires tolerance of the physical and chemical conditions of new habitat, food acquisition, predator avoidance, reproduction, and environmental suitability (Havel et al. 2015). In one study, the invasive predatory gastropod Rapana venosa was investigated for its relationship between establishment success and environmental stress. It was found that R. venosa larvae exhibited a broad tolerance to different salinities, ranging from 7 to 32 ppt. As a result from the data gathered on salinity tolerance, future R. venosa establishment was predicted to follow the counterclockwise, gyre-like circulation direction within the Chesapeake Bay and distribution of larvae northward and lower sections of all major subestuaries of the western shore of the Bay (Mann and Harding 2003). Another study found interspecific aggression and predation between the invading Gammarus pulex and the native Gammarus duebeni celticus amphipod species to be the driving force behind species replacement in the environment. Specifically, male G. pulex displayed more aggressive behavior towards both male and female G. d. celticus engaged in precopula guarding compared to male G. d. celticus. Therefore, studies of the behavior of individuals was suggested to be useful in the understanding of species replacement (Jaimie et al. 1995). Lastly, climate change was mentioned to have a positive effect on establishment success. It was found that initiation of recruitment for the three most abundantly introduced ascidian (sea squirt) species, Ascidiella aspersa, Botrylloides violaceous, and Diplosoma listerianum, was strongly negatively correlated with winter water temperature; in other words, recruitment and subsequent establishment occured earlier in years with warmer winters. On the other hand, the native species recruitment was negatively correlated with winter temperature, meaning more recruitment occurred in colder years. Moreover, it was concluded that global warming can facilitate and accelerate the establishment of non-native species (Stachowicz et al. 2002). Given the above examples, it is clear that some parameters have been linked and have served as good predictors for establishment of specific species. However, a global model that predicts invasion success across multiple species remains elusive.    7  There are many reasons why prediction of establishment is difficult to achieve (Williamson 1999). For example, if the prediction is too general, the outcome may not be precise enough. Also, statistical analysis can be unreliable when prediction is based on small but significant R2 values, extrapolation in multidimensional analyses, reliance on a regression predictor (which is always worse than its fit to the original data), production of disproportionate false positives when expected frequency is low, and new sets of variables associated with each new invader. Biological complications include lack of phylogenetic correction, a time delay in reporting invasions (delayed reports of early stages of invasion fail to predict current, later stages of invasions), non-linearity in population dynamics, complexity of ecosystems, and situation-specific detail (Williamson 1999). Consequently, the traditional approach has been to develop separate models for each new invasive species. This approach is impractical, and poses significant time and effort costs. Therefore, conservation biologists have sought to develop a more universal predictor explaining why certain introduced species successfully establish when others fail. Although successful invaders tend to share some key characteristics in their age at maturity (timing of reproduction) and fecundity (number of individuals produced) (Johnston et al. 2009), a single, generic mechanism is needed to identify the establishment of species and has still yet to be explored.  Propagule Pressure  Currently, the most promising determinant of establishment success is propagule pressure. Propagule pressure is the number of individuals released into a specific region over a given time period (Lockwood et al. 2005, Simberloff 2009). Propagule pressure is comprised of two components: propagule size and propagule number. Propagule size is the number of individuals within a single introduction event, whereas propagule number is the rate, or frequency, at which individuals arrive per unit time (Lockwood et al. 2005, Simberloff 2009).  The majority of evidence demonstrating the importance of propagule pressure in determining establishment success stems from theoretical studies or correlative studies. There have been multiple approaches to measuring and modeling propagule pressure. For unintentional introductions, absence of detailed introduction records often leads to the   8  reliance on less direct proxy variables, such as shipping activity (Wonham et al. 2013). Seebens et al. (2016) developed a modelling approach using global ship movements and environmental conditions to simulate the global spread of 40 marine alien species. The model correctly predicted the presence/absence of an alien species in an ecoregion with 77% accuracy (Seebens et al. 2016). Similarly, in response to the International Maritime Organization’s mandatory ballast-water exchange policy in 2004, a mathematical framework for optimizing ballast-water exchange was developed, including exchange level, timing, and species salinity tolerance as variables. It was found that ballast water exchange was always effective; species survival was worse in post-exchanged water compared to pre-exchanged water. However, in some cases when survival was equal or better following an exchange, early, intermediate, or late exchange needed to be considered, depending on the species (Wonham et al. 2005). In another example, theoretical propagule pressure models included consideration of river dynamics to predict invasion: Van Oorschot et al (2017) developed a morphological model for the invasive plant species Fallopia japonica, in which distribution, native vegetation, and river hydro-morphodynamic processes were influenced by high and low propagule pressure. It was found that high propagule pressure led to a decline in native species cover due to competition and creation of unfavorable native colonization sites. Conversely, low propagule pressure allowed native seedling survival (van Oorschot et al. 2017). Although proxies such as shipping activity offer a method of establishment prediction, the specific components of propagule pressure are difficult to assess individually. For example, time-lags in historical records provide inadequate information in order to make accurate predictions of establishment.  In addition to theoretical studies, there have been empirical studies that report a positive correlation between propagule pressure and establishment success. For example, in a factorial field experiment using larvae of the invasive oyster Crassostrea gigas, propagule size and number were quantitatively altered while propagule pressure was held constant. As predicted, the number of oyster colonizers increased with larger propagule sizes. Interestingly, it was found that small, frequent introductions dramatically increased the population size relative to large, infrequent introductions (Hedge et al. 2012). In another study, the effect of propagule pressure on freshwater fish invasions was   9  investigated using nine fish species transferring from an inter-basin water supply to multiple, small irrigation ponds in South Africa. Out of the nine species, five species (Glossogobius callidus, Gambusia affinis, Gilchristella aestuaria, Oreochromis mossambicus, and Cyprinus caprio) were found to establish in the downstream ponds. In this study, species with more propagules were more likely to become established. Thus, relative interspecific rates of establishment were concluded to be driven by propagule pressure (Woodford et al. 2013). The brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis is another example of an invading fish species. Through a combination of data from fish stocking register and field surveys, Korsu and Huusko (2009) studied the roles of propagule pressure and the invader’s initial dispersal in driving establishment success. It was determined that one-fourth of the fish introduced to suboptimal habitats were found to be established in the core habitats of such species (Korsu and Huusko 2009). Finally, in an experiment using Daphnia magna, different levels of introduction size and introduction number were studied for an effect on population growth and population persistence. On the final day of the experiment, it was found that population size increased with both introduction size and introduction number. The authors also found that the interaction between introduction size and introduction number was positively correlated with persistence (Drake et al. 2005). It can be concluded that empirical studies have reported a direct correlation between propagule pressure and establishment success. Not only do empirical studies provide support to the theory of propagule pressure, but they are consilient with evidence from natural systems.  Propagule Size Although both components of propagule pressure work in concert, they can each have unique influences on establishment success. Propagule size is predicted to have a straightforward impact on establishment: an increase in introduction size results in an increase in establishment probability (Blackburn et al. 2015). A release of a large number of individuals also increases the likelihood that an introduced population will retain representative samplings of source genetic diversity, thus facilitating establishment (Roman and Darling 2007). Moreover, propagule size has been a strong predictor of establishment success (Memmott et al. 2005).    10  In one study, Btitton and Gozlan (2003) used mesocosm ponds to identify how propagule size and number predicted the establishment of the invasive fish, Pseudorasbora parva. Results concluded that population size was a function of propagule size (Britton and Gozlan 2013). In another analysis of propagule pressure, Casey et al. (2004) studied historical introduction success of 10 different bird families (149 species), concluding that propagule size was non-randomly distributed with respect to a range of other characteristics (e.g., body mass, geographical range, annual fecundity) of non-native species. Therefore, the correlation that was seen between such characteristics and establishment success was confounded in propagule size (Cassey et al. 2004). In a mathematical modelling approach intended to replicate historical bird introductions, it was found that models predicted lower probability of establishment when propagule size was divided between multiple introduction events: one introduction event resulted in greater probability of establishment when compared to multiple introduction events that summed to the same size (Cassey et al. 2014). Liu et al. (2014) performed a greenhouse experiment, testing the effects of habitat conditions and propagule size on the establishment success of the invasive plant, Hydrocotyle vulgaris. It was found that both propagule size and habitat conditions significantly affected total biomass, ramet number (population size), leaf area, and stolon length (horizontal connections), especially in grassland communities rather than bare soil (Liu et al. 2014). It was therefore predicted that high propagule pressure, in the form of increased propagule size, enhanced growth of the invasive population. Lastly, in a study using the marine ascidian invader, Botrylloides violaceus, varying sizes of larval propagules were released into various in situ field mesocosms to test whether invasion success was directly related to the number of arriving propagules (Simkanin et al. 2017). It was found that large propagule sizes confer greater invasion success in marine environments, but the relationship is not consistent across habitat types (Simkanin et al. 2017).  Although the majority of studies report a positive correlation between propagule size and establishment success, there has been evidence that propagule size is not the only determinant of establishment success. In one study, establishment of the invasive psyllid, Arytainilla spartiophila, was investigated over six years to determine the effect of propagule size on probability of establishment, probability of persistence, and medium-  11  term population growth. It was found that even though large release sizes survived the experiment, release size did not guarantee establishment. It was observed that one of the largest release sizes struggled over the duration of the experiment, resulting in a smaller population size than some of the smaller initial releases. Therefore, it was concluded that large populations do not always have larger population growth rates; rather it is annual rate of change that provides information for a species population to become established (Memmott et al. 2005). Overall, there has been substantial evidence that propagule size plays an important role in establishment success. However, experimental evidence is further needed in order to resolve conflicting literature.  Propagule Number In theory, the repeated release events of individuals into one location functions as a source pool, which then sustains an introduced population even if the initial introduction was of insufficient size to facilitate long-term establishment. Given that the source pool functions as a means to overcome limitations associated with small populations (i.e., demographic effects), propagule number (introduction frequency) is considered to be relevant and important in determining establishment success (Lockwood et al. 2005). Accordingly, it has been suggested that propagule number is crucial in determining persistence in populations with low average individual fitness levels resulting from inter-specific interactions (Drake et al. 2005). As a result, larger and/or more frequent introductions are more likely to establish non-native populations (Cassey et al. 2014).  In a study using bark (Scolytinae) and long horned beetle (Cerambycidae) species, the relationship between the probability of establishment and arrival rate across an entire pool of potential invading species was analyzed using border interception frequency (port of entry frequency). In this study, boarder interception frequency was used as a proxy for true arrival rate. It was found that there was a positive association between arrival rate and probability of establishment for both bark beetles and long horned beetles (Brockerhoff et al. 2014): the interval between release events affects establishment success. Additionally, Drolet and Locke (2016) demonstrated the importance of propagule number using stochastic population simulations. According to simulation   12  results, when the population was subject to demographic effects, the probability of establishment decreased with increasing propagule number. It was suggested that higher probability of establishment was found in populations introduced by few, but large independent introductions (Drolet and Locke 2016).  Propagule number can have a different influence on genetic diversity compared to propagule size. Propagule number can be dependent on introductions deriving from different source populations. If genetic diversity is different between different source populations, multiple introduction events can result in establishing populations exhibiting greater genetic diversity (Roman and Darling 2007). As a result, more genetically diverse populations can have the ability to overcome demographic stochasticity more easily and increase the probability of establishment. The two factors (propagule number and size) also differ in their response to environmental stochasticity. A high propagule number will allow increased stability in the face of environmental stochasticity, when random environmental disasters can reduce the population size and affect establishment. The inherent temporal conditions of these disasters often do not affect subsequent propagules from establishment. Conversely, an increase in propagule size is more likely to lower the risk of demographic stochasticity (i.e., the variability in population growth) since small populations are often subject to such effects (Lockwood et al. 2005). Given the supporting evidence that propagule size and number have on establishment success, experimental manipulation of each component individually is fundamental in uncovering the mechanism behind establishment success.   Genetic Variation  Small founding populations of introduced species are expected to have lower genetic variation as a result of bottlenecks, compared to variation seen in native populations. As a result, conservation genetics predicts that introduced species would suffer from high risk of inbreeding, which may result in extinction (Roman and Darling 2007). However, introduced species can succeed despite having reduced genetic diversity. For instance, through demographic bottlenecks, deleterious alleles can be eradicated and highly adapted lineages can be preserved through sexual recombination (Roman and Darling 2007). Invasive populations can increase genetic diversity through admixture from   13  multiple native populations (Roman and Darling 2007). This indicates that genetic bottleneck effects can be mitigated by adoption of asexual reproduction and plastic responses to environmental conditions (Roman and Darling 2007). Finally, as in the case of shellfish (e.g., Crassostrea gigas and Crassostrea virginica), translocations between different geographical locations can enhance genetic diversity, thus increasing establishment probability (Roman and Darling 2007). Moreover, multiple pathways provide a means for introduced species to overcome negative genetic effects and establish. The genetics of an introduced species may be influenced by propagule pressure in multiple ways. For example, a larger propagule size would be expected to have greater genetic variation to overcome demographic bottlenecks. Multiple releases that derive from different source populations can result in hybridization between individuals from genetically divergent native populations, thus resulting in a more genetically-diverse population (Allendorf and Lundquist 2003). Invasive to temperate estuaries worldwide, a phylogeographic analysis of the oriental shrimp Palaemon macrodactylus, was completed by Lejeusne et al. (2014) to determine their genetic inheritance. After comparison of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) of P. macrodactylus, it was determined that the majority of introduced populations had higher haplotypic diversity than most native populations (Lejeusne et al. 2014). It was hypothesized that global shipping and ballast water provided repeated introduction events from different sources, therefore allowing the population to compensate for deleterious effects of bottlenecks (Lejeusne et al. 2014). In another study, a genetic analysis was performed on seven Gammaroidea species, including both invaders (Gammarus tigrinus, Pontogammarus maeoticus, and Obesogammarus crassus) and native species (Gammarus locusta, Gammarus salinus, Gammarus zaddachi, and Gammarus oceanicus) in order to evaluate genetic diversity in relation to native range. Although genetic diversity did not differ between invasive and native species, genetic differentiation existed between invasive species. Such evidence supported the claim that geographic and evolutionary distances may explain invasive genetic differentiation. The lack of population genetic structure in invasive populations may, therefore, facilitate distribution of mutations that are beneficial to invasive ranges (Baltazar-Soares et al. 2017). Furthermore, these studies provide evidence that genetic diversity may be a strong driver   14  behind establishment success for introduced species, and that genetic diversity may be used as a nonspecific predictor of invasion potential.   Climate Change  Many species, especially those engaged in long distance dispersal, can adjust geographic ranges in response to climate change (Viana 2017). It has been observed that changes in water temperature are likely to promote establishment of non-native species with the expense of native species (Roman and Darling 2007). Increasing sea temperatures have been shown to correlate with both growth and reproduction of marine fish and invertebrates, which can lead to population increases (Brown et al. 2004, Côte and Green 2012). In addition to increases in water temperature, increases in air temperature due to global warming result in decreased ice cover, increased evaporation, change in hydrology volume due to increased runoff, increased in nutrient inputs, change in habitat stratification, and change in habitat size (Rolls et al. 2017). Such environmental changes could perpetuate the establishment of non-native species into novel regions. For example, the climate boundary between temperate and subarctic temperatures is a natural limit for the distribution of many freshwater fish species, including Cyprinids, Percids, and Centrarchids (Rolls et al. 2017). Therefore, invasions may be associated with poleward range expansions of temperate organisms if subarctic temperatures rise (Rolls et al. 2017). If non-native species are able to interact favorably with a climate-changing environment, competition between native and non-native species may result in the reduced abundance of native species.  In one study, Sheppard et al. (2014) investigated the role of climate and suitability on the establishment of alien plants (Archontophoenix cunninghamiana, Psidium guajava and Schefflera actinophylla), in comparison to native species (Rhopalostylis sapida, Lophomyrtus bullata and Schefflera digitate). Under different climate and suitability conditions, non-native performance was greater than native species. It was concluded that the non-native species were able to persist in a wide range of temperature and precipitation conditions, as long as temperatures do not drop below levels required for survival (Sheppard et al. 2014).  Liu et al. (2011) used ecological niche models to predict the impact of climate change on native and non-native species, which included the   15  invasive red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii. Their model predicted that the distribution of invasive species was due to complex effects of climate change, rather than simply promoting invasion risk. Interestingly, it was found that some regions would become prone to invasion, while others would reduce invasion risk by decreasing invasive potentials or no longer offer climatically suitable areas for P. clarkii establishment (Liu et al. 2011). Finally, a study was conducted in which the effects of climate change were assessed in relation to the establishment of the invasive smallmouth bass, Micropterus dolomite, on populations of native lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush. Results showed that the number of Ontario lakes with vulnerable lake trout populations are predicted to increase from 118 to 1612 by 2050 following a projected increase in climate temperature. It was suggested that establishment was attributed to climate change, as lake trout is considered a cold water species and smallmouth bass is considered a warm water species. The increase in temperature could result in longer stratification periods, thereby decreasing hypolimnetic (deep water) oxygen concentrations and leading to increased frequency of anoxic waters. These anoxic waters are detrimental to lake trout populations (Sharma et al. 2009).   Predation  Predation, or lack thereof within the context of the enemy release hypothesis, may facililate establishment success. Cuthbert et al. (2018) investigated the role of functional response and prey switching of the native predatory amphipod, Gammarus duebeni. Larvae of the native mayfly, Baetis rhodani, and larvae of the invasive gammarid Crangonyx pseudogracilis were used as prey species to G. duebeni (Cuthbert et al. 2018). Functional response is defined as the relationship between resource use and availability (Dick et al. 2014). In the context of invasive species, comparative functional responses reveal the relationship between resource consumption rate (e.g., by a predator) and resource density (e.g., prey) between an invader and a native species (Dick et al. 2013). The premise behind prey switching is that predators that attack a variety of prey feed most heavily on the most abundant species. When a particular prey species declines in number, the predator “switches” to the next most abundant in number (Murdoch 1969). In the study, when both native and invasive prey species were simultaneously presented,   16  it was found that G. duebeni disproportionally fed on more native prey than invasive prey. Thus, prey switching was not exhibited in the presence of invasive prey (Cuthbert et al. 2018).   Allee Effects  As stated above, genetic variation, climate change, and predation are three influences that have been shown to promote establishment success for non-native species. However, Allee effects is a component that has been shown to reduce establishment success. Allee effects can be classified into two types: component Allee effects and demographic Allee effects. Component Allee effects describe the level of components of individual fitness, such as juvenile survival, whereas demographic Allee effects are the level of the overall mean of individual fitness, viewed through the demography of the whole population (Courchamp et al. 2008). At low densities, individual fitness is considered to be higher due to lower intraspecific competition. Conversely, at high densities, intraspecific competition increases. At low densities, if one fitness component decreases, another, higher fitness component may compensate in order to keep intraspecific competition low. This gives rise to a negative density dependence. However, if compensation is not sufficient for low densities, lower individual fitness values domineer. Thus, the result is an Allee effect, in which a lower per capita population growth rate exists (Courchamp et al. 2008).   The strength of an Allee effect can also vary depending on the per capita growth rate. If the Allee effect is weak, the per capita growth rate at lower densities is lower compared to higher densities, but still remains positive. If the Allee effect is strong, the per capita growth rate at lower densities is negative below a certain value, often termed the Allee threshold (Courchamp et al. 2008). Indeed, empirical studies have used thresholds as indicators of establishment (Drake and Jerde 2009). With a strong Allee effect, per capita growth increases from negative values at small population sizes, becomes positive at some critical population size, and then increases with population size until competition becomes a factor (Wittmann et al. 2014).   Allee effects may arise from a number of mechanisms such as mate finding or interbreeding when genetic diversity of the founder population is low (Primack 2006,   17  Clark and Johnston 2009). Allee effects can be correlated with reproductive mechanisms, including fertilization in sessile organisms, mate finding in mobile organisms and cooperative breeding (Courchamp et al. 2008). They can also be correlated with mechanisms related to survival. Such examples include environmental conditioning (allelopapthy), predation, and aggregation by predators. Finally, Allee effects can arise due to cooperative behaviors. Some researchers have argued that highly social species, which demonstrate a need for conspecifics, would be correlated to increased susceptibility to Allee effects (Munoz-Duran 2002, Courchamp et al. 2008).      Allee effects in invasive species Allee effects provide opportunities to study population dynamics during the process of establishment, whether successful or not. This is due to the notion that invasion speed decreases as the Allee effect increases in strength (Taylor and Hastings 2005). This is of particular interest in the field of invasion biology, as uncovering mechanisms that drive establishment can provide insight towards management strategies.  Due to large effective population sizes, Allee effects associated with marine populations have been considered unimportant due to marine populations often being large (Gascoigne and Lipcius 2004). However, Allee effects can still exert effects on large populations. For example, many marine species have larvae that are retained locally, thereby producing confined populations (Jones et al. 1999), which can result in an Allee effects. Many marine species have subpopulations that collectively contribute to metapopulations through larval transport (Lipcius et al. 1997, Crowder et al. 2000, Lipcius et al. 2001, Gascoigne and Lipcius 2004). If density is low and Allee effects are constructed in subpopulations, the metapopulation, as whole, can suffer demographically, and thus be subject to Allee effects. Thus, large population sizes and metapopulation structure are not necessarily accurate predictors for the absence of Allee effects (Gascoigne and Lipcius 2004).  Some species are able to overcome Allee effects using alternative strategies. It is very common for fish species to exhibit the compensatory process of fast growth and rapid maturation in response to low introduction numbers (Britton and Gozlan 2013). Factors that increase propagule resilience to environmental change (e.g. adaptivity and   18  tolerance to temperature and salinity), thereby making them more prone to overcome Allee effects (Johnston et al. 2009). Environmental modification is one key mechanism that can overcome Allee effects. In fact, this is the type of Allee effect that was first observed by the scientist of whom the dynamic is named after, Warder Allee. He demonstrated the Allee effect using goldfish in synthetic pond water containing dissolved salts of high chemical purity in distilled water. Allee demonstrated that goldfish conditioned the water by giving off organic matter and carbon dioxide. He then showed that goldfish grew better in water that other goldfish had lived in and conditioned, thus suggesting that organisms can modify their environment in order to improve survival (Allee 1938).   Notably, the Allee effect has been used to make successful predictions of marine establishment and subsequent invasion. For example, Leung et al. (2004) used survival analysis and maximum likelihood techniques to theoretically predict the establishment of the invasive zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, in Michigan inland lakes. It was determined that the fitted models correctly predicted probabilities of invasion more times using an Allee model versus a non-Allee model (Leung et al. 2004). Additionaly, although not invasive, the gamete morphology of the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, is density-dependent (Levitan 2002, Berec et al. 2018). At times of low density, larger eggs and slow, long-lived sperm are produced, whereas at higher densities, smaller eggs and fast, short-lived sperm are released (Levitan 2002). That being said, the density-dependent selection associated with mate-finding-related traits can provide insight on invasive population control if invasive species demonstrate similar traits. Allee effects have been observed in parasites in coastal marine ecosystems. In a study by Krkošek et al. (2011), they investigated the colonization of the juvenile Pacific salmon by the ectoparasitic salmon lice, Lepeophtheirus salmonis. These parasitic lice demonstrated Allee effects in colonization in that pair formation between pre-adult females and adult male lice was dependent on both local abundance of lice and mate-searching dispersal of males among host fish (Krkošek et al. 2012). Furthermore, it can be suggested that models that consider Allee effects can improve the accuracy of establishment predictions. Overall, Allee effects are important to consider during the establishment phase of   19  invasion, and appear to have some influence on the establishment and spread of a variety of marine species.   Challenges with studying invasions in the natural setting  Researchers have turned to experimental studies to address the validity of the theory of propagule pressure and seek evidence for the driving forces behind establishment success. It is agreed that an ideal experimental design would include quantifying establishment of an invasive species in a natural, biological system. Under such studies, organisms and their interactions can be observed in direct relation to the natural environment, thus taking into account a wide array of environmental variables that would be otherwise difficult to simulate in a mathematical or theoretical framework. However, studying establishment and invasion dynamics in marine environments is challenging. For example, small initial population sizes are challenging to locate and track, multiple confounding environmental factors can obscure invasion dynamics, and invasive species are often not identified until long after establishment has occurred. In addition, invasion is a multi-step and trans-disciplinary process, involving population, community, evolutionary, and physiological biology and their distinct roles in the different stages of invasion (Moyle and Light 1996). Therefore, it is challenging for empirical studies to report on all aspects of the invasion process (Blanchet 2012).   Synthetic Biology  To overcome the issues relating to the study of invasion dynamics in natural systems, researchers have used synthetic biology to explain complex, ecological and evolutionary processes. Synthetic biology can be defined as the engineering of biology and synthesis of biological systems (Serrano 2007). The premise behind synthetic biology is that rather than looking at a list of parts that comprise organismal complexity, research focus should be directed towards how such parts combine together (Mukherji and van Oudenaarden 2009). Synthetic biology aims to engineer novel, model-guided behaviors into cells using gene circuits (Zomorrodi and Segre 2016). Gene circuits are assembled using genes from diverse sources, which are used to implement a variety of functions including growth and division, signaling, and differentiation (Nandagopal and Elowitz   20  2011). Elementary gene circuits are circuits in which gene expression is regulated by a single protein in response to a signal. A signal is defined as a molecule that causes a physiological response. Once the signal acts on the protein, the protein then binds to the DNA region that codes for a specific gene, resulting in the expression of that gene. However, depending on how the circuit is designed, proteins can either bind to DNA sequences to activate or repress gene expression (Wall et al. 2004). By building together series of activators and repressors that interconnect, one can build a gene circuit that produces a novel behavior in the cell. In summary, each component of the gene circuit works in concert along with the cellular components to simulate a core behavior observed in nature. Synthetic systems offer an advantage over other measurements of natural systems by incorporating both engineering and biological aspects. Specifically, synthetic systems are able to test the function of core dynamics with minimal interference from background processes. Synthetic systems offer a method to culture, control, manipulate, and achieve rapid reproduction rates in correlation with a natural occurrence that would be otherwise difficult to measure in natural systems (Yu et al. 2012, Dressler et al. 2017). To date, synthetic systems have contributed to the understanding of complex natural systems, particularly in the field of ecology and evolutionary biology. For example, engineered microbes have been used to study cooperative dynamics within and between populations (Dressler et al. 2017), predator-prey relationships (You et al. 2004), and mechanisms that maintain biodiversity (Kerr et al. 2002). As a result, synthetic biology can be used as an alternative approach to studying establishment dynamics, and could thus be used to study propagule pressure.   Question and Objective  In this thesis, the overarching goal was to use bacteria engineered using the principles of synthetic biology to contain an Allee effect to examine how propagule pressure dictates establishment success. Within this overarching goal, we studied three aims: (1) to determine how the timing between introduction events affects establishment success, (2) to determine how varying initial introduction density affects establishment   21  success, and (3) to determine how reducing generation time in a population expressing an Allee effect affects establishment success.   Aim 1: Determine how the timing between introduction events affects establishment success  Propagule number is one component of propagule pressure that has yet to be explicitly studied. Conflicting literature in combination with the lack of empirical studies that specifically investigate propagule number provide the need for a mechanistic understanding of its role in establishment success for populations suffering from Allee effects. We examined how the timing between two successive introductions influences establishment success, with a specific focus on propagule sizes that are below an Allee threshold. By doing so, the conditions by which propagule pressure dictates establishment success can be defined in a clear, concise way.  Hypotheses H0:  A second introduction of bacteria will not increase the survival of a population that is below the Allee threshold. Ha:  A second introduction of bacteria will increase the survival of a population that is below the Allee threshold.  H0:  Total cell density is not dependent on the timing of a second introduction of bacteria. Ha:  Total cell density is dependent on the timing of a second introduction of bacteria.  Aim 2: Determine how varying initial introduction density affects establishment success  Intuitively, a sufficiently large propagule size that is above the Allee threshold will allow establishment and growth. However, when propagule size is below the Allee threshold, growth may or may not occur. It is known that propagule size is not a fixed value. Rather, propagule size can fluctuate between introduction events. Consequently, we examined how varying propagule size between two introduction events influenced   22  population growth. To accomplish this, we kept the total number of cells (i.e. volume) constant, but varied the proportion of total cells introduced initially and at the second introduction event. Through observation of population growth with different propagule sizes (as a function of time to second introduction), we provide evidence for the importance of each component (propagule size and propagule number) in establishment success.   Hypotheses H0:  Varying the volume of bacteria introduced during the first and second introduction will not affect the period over which equal volume introductions result in growth of total cell density. Ha:  Varying the volume of bacteria introduced during the first and second introduction will affect the period over which equal volume introductions result in growth of total cell density.  Aim 3: Determine how reducing generation time in a population expressing an Allee effect affects establishment success  A major benefit of using engineered bacteria is the ability to fine tune and perturb the behavior of the gene circuit. This can be accomplished using factors that directly (e.g., the amount of inducer) or indirectly (e.g., the composition of the medium) influence the function of the gene circuit. Previous studies have noted that the environmental conditions will not be consistent during an invasion, which may affect the ability of a species to establish. One proposed factor that affects establishment success is growth rate (McDermott and Finnoff 2016). In our study, the concentration of casamino acids in the medium controls the growth rate of the population. By altering the concentration of casamino acids in the medium and measuring cell density, we were able to determine how generation time (i.e. growth rate) had an effect on propagule size and number. An understanding of how generation time affects establishment success will allow us to develop a potential mechanism for patterns observed in establishing species demonstrating Allee effects. Furthermore, findings may be used to establish stronger control/limitation of establishing non-native species.   23   Hypotheses H0:  Decreasing the concentration of casamino acids in the medium will not result in a change in period over which equal volume introductions result in growth of total cell density. Ha:  Decreasing the concentration of casamino acids in the medium will result in a change in period over which equal volume introductions result in growth of total cell density.     24  Chapter I References  Executive Order.

In an effort to inform strategies that prevent establishment and spread of invasive species, several studies have tried to identify broadly defined characteristics that correlate with establishment success and invasiveness (Veltman et al. 1996, Kolar and Lodge 2001, Forsyth et al. 2004, Davis 2009). Previously identified characteristics include body mass, genetic diversity, reproductive strategy, diet, thermal tolerance, and environmental suitability (Foreman et al. 2012, Duncan 2016, Estrada et al. 2016, Peoples et al. 2017). While these characteritsics have proven somewhat effective in their ability to predict establishment and invasiveness success at a species-specific level (Wang and Jackson 2011), a strong, generalized predictor to identify potential invaders is desired. One theoretically proposed determinate of establishment success is propagule pressure, which is defined as the number of individuals released into a specific area over a given time period (Lockwood et al. 2005, Simberloff 2009). Propagule pressure is composed of two components: propagule size and propagule number. Propagule size is the number of individuals released in a single introduction event, whereas propagule number is the frequency at which individuals are introduced per unit time (Lockwood et al. 2005, Simberloff 2009). One unique property of propagule pressure is its predicted ability to overcome a population dynamic that can inhibit establishment, the Allee effect, which is defined as a positive relationship between the fitness of an individual and population density (Taylor and Hastings 2005, Smith et al. 2014). For species with an Allee effect, the population will only become established and grow if a minimal density of individuals is present. If this minimal density is not met, the population will grow slowly (weak Allee effect), or not at all (strong Allee effect), both of which can limit establishment success (Taylor and Hastings 2005). Allee effects have been observed to regulate the establishment and spread of invasive species (Johnson et al. 2006), and are often due to the inability to initiate cooperation between individuals at low initial density (Allee 1951).    34  While propagule pressure remains a promising metric to predict potential invasiveness, its true contribution to predicting establishment success remains somewhat unresolved. On the one hand, several studies have shown that propagule pressure is positively correlated with establishment success (Supplementary Table S1). For example, it has been found that by increasing propagule pressure of water fleas, the probability of establishment increases, even in the presence of an Allee effect (Drake 2004, Gertzen et al. 2011). On the other hand, several studies show a weak, or apparently non-existent, correlation between propagule pressure and establishment success (Supplementary Table S1). For example, in an analysis of passeriform birds, differences in propagule sizes did not predict establishment success (Moulton et al. 2013).  These conflicting data may be due to a lack of understanding as to how the relative roles of propagule size and propagule number affect establishment success. It has been acknowledged that both components of propagule pressure have unique relationships with establishment probability, and that, for a given scenario, one element may become more important than another (Lockwood et al. 2005). For example, propagule size has a greater influence on propagule pressure when a population is subject to a strong Allee effect and demographic stochasticity (Lockwood et al. 2005, Wittmann et al. 2014), whereas propagule number has a more influence during times of environmental stochasticity (Lockwood et al. 2005). Moreover, this conflicting data may also be due to an inability to sufficiently detect, quantify, and track populations in nature during their early stages of invasion (Silveira et al. 2017). It is also confounded by the limited number of experimental studies that have evaluated the ability of propagule pressure to determined establishment success (Drake et al. 2005). Overall, it remains unclear how propagule pressure affects establishment success for a population with an Allee effect.  To understand how propagule pressure affects establishment success for a population with an Allee effect, we used a strain of Escherichia coli that contains a gene circuit that confers an Allee effect to the population. Gene circuits are used in the field of synthetic biology to engineer novel behaviors into cells. To date, synthetic systems have contributed to our understanding of complex ecological and evolutionary dynamics (Tanouchi et al. 2012). Accordingly, synthetic systems have been used to study cooperation (Dressler et al. 2017), predator-prey relationships (You et al. 2004), and mechanisms that   35  allow maintenance of biodiversity (Kerr et al. 2002). Studying these processes using synthetic systems can remove or reduce confounding factors that can obscure dynamics observed in nature, and allow biological behaviors to unfold in controllable and easily quantifiable environments (Yu et al. 2012, Dressler et al. 2017).  They can also confirm previous theoretical predictions, thus providing empirical evidence to support theoretical findings (Smith et al. 2014).   Results An experimental approach to examine propagule pressure and establishment success  A previously engineered strain of bacteria that had an Allee effect was used (Smith et al. 2014, Wilson et al. 2017) (Fig. 1a, see Supplementary Fig. S1 for gene circuit). The gene circuit in these bacteria consisted of the LuxR/LuxI quorum-sensing system from Vibrio fischeri (Visick et al. 2000) and the CcdA/CcdB toxin-antitoxin module from the F conjugative plasmid (Bernard et al. 1993). Expression of both is induced by isopropyl-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). CcdB causes cell death by inhibiting DNA replication (Dao-Thi et al. 2005). However, N-Acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) synthesized by LuxI/LuxR system can rescue the population, as it is diffusible and can be shared amongst all of the members. If the concentration of AHL synthesized by the entire population is sufficiently high, CcdB is inhibited by CcdA, and the bacteria grow. If an insufficient concentration of AHL is synthesized, the population grows slowly, and can go extinct. As each bacterium synthesizes on average the same amount of AHL, whether or not a sufficient concentration of AHL is achieved is based on the initial density of the population. Consequently, the population of these bacteria have an Allee effect (Allee et al. 1949, Courchamp et al. 2008). Similar to some characteristics of non-native species, such as aggregation for mate finding (Wells et al. 1998), Myxococcus xanthus formation of a fruit body structure with stress-resistant spores (Kadam and Velicer 2006), litter production by the hybrid cattail Typha latifolia and Typha angustifolia (Farrer and Goldberg 2009), flucturations in cell growth relating to dispersal and spread of Escherichia coli (Smith et al. 2014), these bacteria cooperate to modify their environment via the production of AHL to overcome the Allee effect.   36   To investigate how propagule pressure influences establishment and growth of our engineered bacteria, we designed an experimental protocol that we termed a ‘multiple introduction experiment’. At time zero, a group of bacteria at a given density were added into the center of a well in a 24-well plate (Fig. 1b). A 24-well plate was chosen due to the size of the well allowing for uniform mixing while shaking as well as an adequate time period for observation of growth. These bacteria were allowed to synthesize AHL for a given period of time, whereupon a second introduction of a group of bacteria of a given initial density occured. Thirty-six hours after the initial introduction of bacteria, cell density was quantified using OD600. Changing the density of bacteria inoculated into the well could be used as a surrogate of changing propagule size. Changing the timing between introduction events served to manipulate a facet of propagule number, the time period between releases. This experimental setup therefore mimics group dispersal, where multiple individuals will attempt to disperse to and colonize a new area, which has been observed in invasive species (Jongejans et al. 2008, Murray and Phillips 2010).   To establish that the engineered bacteria could function properly in our multiple introduction experimental setup, we inoculated medium containing various initial densities of bacteria into the 24-well plate and measured colony forming units (CFU, Fig. 1c) and OD600 (Fig. 1d) after 24 hours. When the medium was not supplemented with IPTG growth was observed at all initial densities using both CFU and OD600. However, when the medium was supplemented with IPTG, we observed that if the initial density of the bacteria was above ~105 CFU/mL, growth was observed as measured by an increase in CFUs and OD600. If the initial density of bacteria was below ~5 x 103 CFU/mL, CFUs decreased and an increase in OD600 was not observed. Between these two initial densities, growth was variable: for some biological replicates CFUs and OD600 increased slightly, whereas in others, CFUs and OD600 decreased. This region, which we designate the region of Allee threshold, approached the bifurcation point of the system. In line with previous publications that have examined the Allee effect, growth was variable within this region (Méndez et al. 2011, Poole et al. 2012, Cai et al. 2013). Studying populations near the Allee threshold is important as previous studies have indicated that noise in this region can be critical in determining establishment and invasion success (Potapov and Rajakaruna 2013).      37 Figure 1103 105 107dCell Density (OD600)00.40.81.2Initial CFU/mL-1001020104 105 106Initial CFU/mLln(CFUfinal)-ln(CFUinitial)cRegion of Allee Threshold >105~104<103>105~104<103ONOFFFig. 1a bTime (hours)Introduce BacteriaIntroduce BacteriaGrowthGrowthNo growthLow Cell DensityHigh Cell DensityInsufficient AHLSufficient AHL0 36 Fig. 1.

Right panel: Final OD600 plotted as a function of binned initial densities (CFU/mL).     38  The timing between two introduction events determines establishment success Previous  studies that have experimentally evaluated the contribution of propagule pressure to establishment success have yielded somewhat conflicting data. It has been observed that interactions between propagule size and number affect population establishment, but both components alone have little influence (Drake et al. 2005). A previous study found that one introduction of high propagule size led to establishment more often as compared to than smaller, frequent introduction events (Sinclair and Arnott 2016). In contrast, a previous study has found that propagule number was more important than size in determining establishment success (Koontz et al. 2017). Taken together, even in experimental systems, there is debate about the role of propagule pressure in determining establishment success. One potentially overlooked component that could affect establishment success is the time between introduction events. In theory, two introduction events that occur sufficiently close together, could increase establishment success. To test this idea, we used our multiple introductions experimental approach. We hypothesized that for an initial introduction that was above the Allee threshold (initial density of >105 CFU/mL), establishment and growth would always occur. Conversely, if an initial introduction of bacteria was near the Allee threshold, establishment and growth may not occur, even if the initial introduction was supplemented with a second introduction event. We focused our experiments on the scenario where the first introduction event did not result in successful establishment and growth. This scenario allowed us to examine how a second introduction, which varied in time relative to the first event, would impact establishment and growth.   We initially used our multiple introduction experiment (Fig. 1b) to determine the ability of two introductions (an initial 10 μL introduction, then a second 10 μL introduction) of equal density to result in growth and establishment. We observed that if the initial density of bacteria introduced was greater than 105 CFU/mL, OD600 increased regardless of time between the first and second introductions (Fig. 2a). When the density of bacteria introduced was near the Allee threshold, OD600 was observed to increase under certain circumstances. If a single introduction resulted in an increased in OD600, a similar increase was observed in all wells regardless of time between the first and second introductions (Fig. 2b). However, when the initial density of bacteria introduced at first   39  introduction event did not result in an increase in OD600, an increase in OD600 was only observed within a range of time between the first and second introductions (Fig. 2c). We observed that if the time between introduction events was greater than 16 hours, OD600 was not significantly greater than zero (one-tailed t-test, P values listed in Table S2). Otherwise, if the time between introduction events was 16 hours or less, an increase in OD600 observed. These data suggested that growth is maximized when the timing between two successive introduction events is sufficiently short.  AHL production is important in determining growth in our multiple introduction experiments  To explain these findings, we hypothesized that AHL produced by the first introduced was insufficient to rescue itself, but sufficient to rescue the second introduced population. Since death due to CcdB is not instantaneous and occurs over several hours (You et al. 2004), populations inoculated in the first introduction event can produce AHL over an extended period of time before succumbing to CcdB. This AHL would be available to the second population, which in turn would also create its own AHL. The combination of AHL produced by these population could then rescue the second population and allow for growth.   To demonstrate that AHL produced by the first population was critical for rescuing the second population, we performed our multiple introductions experiment. We inoculated 10 µL of bacteria in medium with IPTG and allowed the first population to synthesize AHL for 8 hours (Fig. 2d). We then filtered the medium to remove bacteria, but not AHL. We placed the filtered medium back into the plate, introduced an additional 10 µL of bacteria, and measured cell density after 36 hours. We observed an increase in OD600 in populations grown in filtered and non-filtered medium. This indicated that AHL produced from the first population was sufficient to rescue the second.  To demonstrate that removing AHL produced by the first population does not result in growth of the second population, we performed our multiple introduction experiment using 10 µL of bacteria. We allowed the first population to synthesize AHL for 8 hours (Fig. 2e). We then collected the medium, pelleted the bacteria using centrifugation, and resuspended them, along with a second 10 µL introduction of bacteria, in fresh M9 medium   40  containing IPTG. After 36 hours, we did not observe a significant increase in OD600 in bacteria resuspended in fresh medium, whereas an increase in OD600 was observed for bacteria that were not collected via centrifugation. This indicated that removing AHL produced from the first population did not allow the second population to grow.  Finally, to demonstrate that AHL could rescue populations where the time to reintroduction was greater than 16 hours, we performed our multiple introduction experiment. We introduced 10 µL bacteria in medium with IPTG, and allowed them to synthesize AHL  for 24 hours (Fig. 2f). We then introduced a second 10 µL aliquot of bacteria along with 100 nM  of purified AHL. After 36 hours of total growth, we observed a significant increase in growth for populations supplemented with purified AHL, but did  not observe an increase in OD600 for populations not supplemented with purified AHL. This indicated that the lack of growth past 16 hours observed in our multiple introduction experiments was predominantly due to an insufficient concentration of AHL, and not due to nutrient exhaustion or changes in cell physiology outside of the circuit dynamics.  A reduction in generation time decreases establishment success  Previous studies have shown that a fast generation time (e.g., number of broods per season (O'Connor 1986, Duncan et al. 1999), early maturity (Richardson and Rejmanek 2004), and frequent litters (Capellini et al. 2015)) is positively correlated with establishment success. However, it has also been found that there is no significant correlation between generation time and establishment success (Veltman et al. 1996). For species with an Allee effect, a faster generation time helps to overcome the Allee threshold (Shaw and Kokko 2015). Given that generation time may play an important role in determining establishment success, we sought to examine how changing the generation time of our engineered bacteria affected the range of times to second introduction that led to growth.  To manipulate the growth rate of our engineered bacteria, we altered the amount of casamino acids in the growth medium. We first confirmed that increasing the percentage of casamino acids in the growth medium increased growth rate (Fig. 3a). To accomplish this, we grew our engineered bacteria in M9 medium with increasing     41 Figure 2a bTime to Second Introduction (hours)OD600at 36 hoursc00.030.060 4 8 12 16 20 2400.10.20.30.40.50 4 8 12 16 20 2400.10.20.30.40 4 8 12 16 20 24Fig. 20.000.030.060.000.030.06d e0 8Time to Second Introduction (hours)FilteredNot-filteredFresh mediumOD600at 36 hoursConditionedmedium0 8f0.000.030.06+ AHL-AHL0 24  Fig. 2.

(b) Cell density when a single introduction event led to an increase in OD600. When the initial bacteria introduced (2.66 x 104 CFU/mL +/- 2.04 x 104) was within the Allee threshold, and a single introduction event was sufficient to result in an increase in OD600 (time = 0), OD600 increased regardless of the time to second introduction. (c) Cell density of bacteria when a single introduction did not lead to an increase in OD600. Initial density of bacteria introduced (2.61 x 104 CFU/mL +/- 1.25 x 104) was within the Allee threshold. If a second introduction event occured up to 16 hours after the first introduction event, an increase in OD600 was observed. After 16 hours, an increase in OD600 is not observed. (d) After 8 hours of growth, we filtered, or did not filter as a control, the medium through a 0.22 m filter to remove cells, but allowed AHL to remain in the medium. We then made a second introduction into the filtered medium. We observed growth in both filtred and non-filtered medium, the difference of which was insignificance (P = 0.08, two-tailed t-test). Standard deviation from eight biological replicates. (e) After 8 hours of growth, we removed, or did not remove as a control, the medium containing bacteria from the well. We centrifuged the cells, and resuspended them in fresh medium with IPTG.

Standard deviation from seven biological replicates. (f) After 24 hours, we performed a second introduction event. In one of the wells, we added 100 nM of purified AHL resuspended in ethanol and 10L of bacteria. In a second well (control), we only added 10L of bacteria. We observed that the addition of purified AHL was sufficient to allow population growth (P < 0.001, one-tailed t-test), whereas no growth was observed in the populations without exogenously added AHL (P = 1.0, one-tailed t-test).    42  percentages of casamino acids (without IPTG), and measured OD600 over 24 hours. We then determined growth rate by determining the slope of a linear line fit through the region of exponential growth. We observed that as the concentration of casamino acids increased in the growth medium, the growth rate of the bacteria increased.  Next, we sought to determine if translation rate, which could impact AHL production rate independently of growth rate, was affected by changing the percentage of casamino acids in the medium. We grew a GFP expressing strain of E. coli for 24 hours in the M9 medium with increasing percentages of casamino acids (Fig. 3b). At 20-minute intervals, we measured OD600 and GFP (a.u.). We then plotted normalized GFP (GFP (a.u.)/OD600) as a function of time, and determined the translation rate by determining the slope of a linear line fit through the region of exponential growth. We observed that as the percentage of casamino acids increased in the medium, the rate at which GFP was produced also increased, which indicates that translation rate also increased in the cell.  Since increasing translation rate may affect the circuit functionality and dynamics, we sought to determine if changing the percentage of casamino acids in the growth medium changed the region of Allee threshold. We inoculated medium with increasing percentages of casamino acids and containing various initial densities of bacteria into the 24 well plate and measured colony forming units (with IPTG, as was performed to generate Fig 1c). We observed that the region of the Allee threshold remained unchanged (5 x 103 - <  105 CFU/mL) when casamino acids were varied between 0.1% and 2% (Fig. 3c). Furthermore, we observed that OD600 remained a consistent indicator of growth. When experiments were initiated with an initial density above the Allee threshold, there was an increase in OD600 (Fig. 3d). Conversely, there was no observable increase in OD600 when the initial density was in the region or below the Allee threshold.  To determine the influence that growth rate had on the range of times to second introduction that led to growth, we performed our multiple introductions experiment (Fig. 1b), but changed the concentration of casamino acids in the medium.  Our previous results (Fig. 2c) had demonstrated that with two inoculations of 10 μL, we did not observe growth if the time to second introduction was greater than 16 hours. We observed that decreasing the percentage of casamino acids to 1% served to constrain the times to second introduction      43 Figure 3Fig. 3Growth rate  (OD600/mini x10-3)0.1 1 200.20.40.60.8d10.80.60.40.20Casamino Acids (%)Growth Rate Casamino Acids (%)GFP/OD600020400801000.1 1 2Translation Rate-15-10-50510ln(CFUfinal)-ln(CFUinitial)Initial CFU/mLc>105~104<103Initial CFU/mL>105~104<103Cell Density (OD600)a00.030.061%00.030.060 4 8 12 16 20 240.1%00.030.062%OD600at 36 hoursTime to Second Introduction (hours)b e0.1%1 %2 %  Fig. 3.

A further reduction in casamino acids to 0.1% resulted in no growth at all times to second introduction examined. Overall, we observed that reducing growth rate constrained the times to second introduction that led to growth.   Asymmetry in the density of bacteria introduced increases establishment success  Our analysis using the same cell density for both introduction events demonstrated that growth of the population is constrained by the timing between the first and second introductions. However, in nature, it is likely that propagule size will vary between introduction events (Lockwood et al. 2005), which may impact the aforementioned dynamics. Accordingly, we explored how varying the density of bacteria between introduction events influenced growth. We performed our multiple introduction experiment (Fig. 1b) but varied the total density of bacteria that was inoculated at the first  and second introduction events by changing the volume of cells that were inoculated. The total volume of bacteria introduced in both inoculation events remained the same (20 μL). This allowed us to rule out how changes in the volume of medium in the well might impact the accumulation of AHL, and competition through increased nutrient, thus allowing our experiments to focus on the effect of bacterial density.   We observed that as the cell density between the first and second introduction diverged, longer times to second introduction resulted in OD600 values significantly greater than zero (Fig. 4a and b). When the introduction volumes used were combinations of 5 μL  and 15 μL, growth was not observed if the time to second introduction exceeded 20 hours. When the introduction volumes used were combinations of 1 μL and 19 μL, growth was observed at all times to second introduction measured. In general, we observed that as the cell density of the two introduction events became more asymmetrical (Fig. 4b), the time to second introduction that resulted in an increase in OD600 occurred increased.       45 Figure 400.030.06 10µL/10µL00.030.0615µL/5µL00.030.065µL/15µL00.030.060 4 8 12 16 20 24Time (hours)1µL/19µL00.030.06 19µL/1µLFig. 4a bOD600at 36 hours510152025300 10 20Volume of First Introduction (μL)Maximum Time to Second Introduction Allowing Growth  Fig. 4.

Data from panel a.     46  Discussion   In efforts to better understand the conditions under which propagule pressure does or does not influence establishment, we used bacteria engineered with an Allee effect. For populations with initial densities within the region of the Allee threshold, we observed that growth rate, propagule size, and time to second introduction can determine establishment  success and growth. We observed that when two introduction of equal density are made, growth is not observed if the timing between two introduction events is too long. Reducing the growth rate of the bacteria served to limit the timing between introduction events that resulted in growth. Furthermore, we observed that as the cell density of the two introduction events became more asymmetrical, the times to second introduction over which growth occurred increased. Overall, our results suggest that a critical determinant of the success of propagule pressure in determining establishment success is the timing between multiple introductions. If the timing between these introductions is too long, then establishment and growth may not occur. As the timing between introduction events would likely be unknown during natural invasions, this dynamic may account for the lack of congruence between studies that do, and do not, demonstrate a positive correlation between propagule pressure and establishment success.  One mechanism that can lead to an Allee effect is through environmental modification, the process of which is simulated by our engineered bacteria. Indeed, previous studies have suggested that invasive species can overcome Allee effects through environmental modification (Allee 1938, Cappucinno 2004, Farrer and Goldberg 2009, Laland et al. 2015). We surmise that the reason why growth was not observed if the time between the first and second introduction was too long (Fig. 2c, Fig. 3e, Fig. 4a) is due to interactions between production and decay of AHL, or more broadly, modification of the environment. As each bacterium produces (on average) the same amount of AHL, increasing either the growth rate or the initial population density would serve to increase the total amount of AHL produced over a given period of time. However, the AHL that is produced is not stable and is degraded in the medium according to first order decay (Wang and Leadbetter 2005). Therefore, any AHL available to a given cell would be a function of the production of AHL by the entire population minus its decay in the medium. These dynamics can be used to offer an explanation as to why, in some cases, growth was not   47  observed after a second introduction of bacteria. Experiments where we manipulated the presence or absence of AHL (Fig 2d-f) strongly suggest that AHL is a critical determinant of growth in our experiments.  The data presented in Fig. 2c shows that, for two introduction of 10 μL, growth does not occur if the time to second introduction was greater than 16 hours. Taking into account the production and decay of AHL, we believe that after 16 hours, AHL has degraded to such a point that it cannot rescue the population that is inoculated in the second introduction event. However, if the time to second introduction occurs at or before 16 hours, the AHL produced from the first population, in combination with AHL produced from the second population, is sufficient to rescue the second population, and thus growth is observed. Decreasing the percentage of casamino acids in the medium served to constrain the times to second introduction that resulted in growth. Here, reducing the percentage of casamino acids reduces growth rate (Fig. 3a) and translation rate (Fig. 3b), both of which would reduce the amount of AHL produced by each bacterium, and thus the amount available for the population as a whole. Insufficient AHL is produced by all populations when grown in medium with 0.1% casamino acids, and thus growth is not observed. When grown in medium with 1% casamino acids, growth was not observed if the time to second introduction was less than 10 hours or greater than 14 hours. We surmise that between 10 and 14 hours represents a ‘sweet spot,’ where production of AHL from the first population is sufficient to rescue the second population. After 14 hours, AHL has degraded sufficiently so as to not rescue the second population. Before 10 hours, due to the decrease in growth and AHL production rate caused by the reduction in casamino acids, the combined population cannot synthesize a sufficient amount of AHL to rescue the entire population. Overall, reducing growth rate serves to limit the positive effect that propagule pressure can have on establishment success.   Previous studies have suggested that large propagule sizes can increase the likelihood of establishment (Simberloff 2009). The results presented in our study appear to confirm these findings (Fig. 4a-b). Moreover, our results suggest that, when considering the same total amount of propagules, asymmetry in propagule size between two introductions may increase the likelihood of establishment success. We surmise that this is due, as described above, to the production and decay kinetics of AHL (Fig. 5). Populations   48  with higher densities would produce more AHL relative to those with smaller densities. Similarly, it would take a longer time for AHL produced by a population with a high density to degrade below a concentration that is insufficient to rescue a second introduction. In experiments with a large initial introduction density (19 μL/1 μL and 15 μL/5 μL), the increased amount of AHL produced by the first population, coupled with the longer time required for its decay, served to increase the times to second introduction that allowed growth. In experiments with a smaller first population, (1 μL/19 μL and 5 μL/15 μL), the amount of AHL produced by the population in the second introduction, coupled with the small amount produced by the first introduction, is sufficiently large to rescue the population. Since the amount of AHL produced by the population in the second introduction is large, it serves to extend the times to second introduction that still allow growth to occur. Overall, asymmetry in propagule size also serves to increase the times to second introduction that allow population growth.  5Fig. 5Time[AHL]1st population rescues 2nd2nd population rescues 1st1st might rescue 2ndabc     Fig. 5: We hypothesize that the production and decay dynamics and AHL can explain our results. (a) The amount of AHL produced by the first population is sufficiently large to rescue the second population (19μL/1μL introduction). The second population continues to produce AHL (orange line), thus allowing growth. (b) AHL produced by the first population may be insufficient to rescues the second population. If the second population is introduced at a time where AHL produced by the first population has degraded below a threshold (dotted line), the second population cannot take advantage of the AHL produced by the first population, and growth does not occur. However, if the second population is introduced prior to AHL degraded below the threshold, population growth occurs (15μL/5μL, 10μL /10μL, and 5μL /15μL cases). (c) AHL produced from the 1st population does not reach the threshold to rescue the second population. However, because the second population is sufficiently high in density, the AHL produced from the second population serves to rescue the first population, and growth occurs (1μL /19μL case).     49  Although the role of propagule pressure in biological establishment has been widely attributed, the concept can also be applied to reintroduction biology, or more broadly, establishment, in general. To achieve a high probability of establishment success, management strategies should evaluate factors including environmental conditions and life history parameters (Tabak et al. 2018). In addition to these factors, our results suggest that one initial introduction of high density close to the Allee threshold can rescue smaller populations introduced at later times. Furthermore, repeated introduction events that are within or near the Allee threshold, and at similar density, can result in population extinction if the timing between introduction events is too long.  Our results may have implications in the management of invasive species. Previous management approaches have emphasized reducing the number of individuals in an established by reducing the propagule size per introduction event below the Allee threshold (Johnson et al. 2006). As our results showed that one introduction of sufficiently high density can rescue an introduction of low density, this approach appears to be warranted. However, our results suggest that simply reducing the propagule size of dispersers below the Allee threshold may not be sufficient if multiple introduction events are predicted to occur. Here, it would be important to extend the timing between potential dispersal or introduction events through management strategies that attempt to limit the frequency and number of vectors to particular locations, such as the regulation of shipping pathways (Johnston et al. 2009).   Overall, our results suggest that the timing between two introduction events is a critical determinant of the ability of propagule pressure to facilitate establishment success. While our study considered populations that are well-mixed, marine environments are heterogeneous. Therefore, it would be interesting to examine how these dynamics factor into environments that are spatially heterogeneous. Moreover, while highly quantitative empirical data on the establishment of cooperative, non-native species is sparse, it would be interesting to examine such data to determine if there is evidence to support our findings. As we turn to the future, we are one step closer to understanding the complex process by which invasions operate.      50  Methods and Materials General growth conditions  Escherichia coli DH5αPRO (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) was used throughout this study unless otherwise indicated. The majority of our experiments were performed in modified M9 medium [1X M9 salts (48 mM Na2HPO4, 22 mM KH2PO4, 862 mM NaCl, 19 mM NH4Cl), 0.4% glucose, 2% casamino acids (Teknova, Hollister, CA), 0.5% thiamine (Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, MA), 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM CaCl2] buffered to pH 7.4 with 100 mM 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS, Amresco, Solon, OH). We inoculated single colonies from an agar plate (1% agar) into 3 mL Luria–Bertani (LB) medium (Genessee Scientific, El Cajon, CA). Overnight cultures were allowed to grow for approximately 24 hours. Short-term agar storage plates containing individual colonies were replaced approximately every 2 weeks. Unless otherwise indicated, all media contained 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol (Alfa Aesar, Heysham, England) and 50 μg/mL kanamycin (Amresco). The gene circuit was activated using 1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, Promega, Madison, WI).   Determining the region of Allee threshold   From an overnight culture, 1 mL of bacteria was transferred into a separate microfuge tube. After centrifugation for 1 min at 12,000 rpm, the supernatant was removed and cells were resuspended in 1 mL of fresh modified M9 medium. A 10-fold dilution series was then performed. 10 μL from each tube of the dilution series was inoculated into 0.5 mL of M9 medium (that did, or did not, contain IPTG) that was contained in the well of a 24 well microplate (Costar 3524, Corning, Oneonta, New York). To prevent evaporation, the medium was covered with 500  μL of mineral oil (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ). Culture plates were incubated at 37 ºC while shaking at 160 revolutions per minute (RPM) for 36 hours. Cell density was measured using OD600 in a Victor X4 microplate reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA). Colony forming units (CFU) were determined as previously described (Smith et al. 2014). To determine the region of the Allee threshold (e.g., near the bifurcation point in the system), we plotted (ln(CFUfinal) – ln( CFUinitial)) versus initial density, and located the range of initial densities where growth   51  did not increase significantly, or decreased, over 36 hours. A minimum of three biological replicates were used for our analysis. To determine how changing the percentage of casamino acids affected the Allee threshold, we performed the experiment described above but changed the percentage of casamino acids in the M9 medium.  Multiple introduction experiments  Bacteria were serially diluted in M9 medium without IPTG. 10 μL from the serial dilutions was inoculated into 24 well plates as described in “Determining Region of the Allee Threshold” that contained 500 μL of M9 medium supplemented with 1 mM IPTG. We focused on using initial densities in the region of the Allee threshold, which was verified by measuring CFU as previously described (Smith et al. 2014).  This initial inoculation represented the first introduction event in our experiments. The 24 well plate was shaken at 160 RPM at 37 ºC.  The serial dilutions from which the bacteria were inoculated from was placed at 4oC so that their density did not change over the course of the experiment. After a given period of time (ranging from 2 hours to 24 hours), the serial dilution was removed from 4oC, and 10 μL from the serial dilution was added into the same well in the 24 well plate. This represented the second introduction event. Plates were then shaken at 160 RPM at 37 ºC for a total of 36 hours, regardless of the timing of the second introduction event. Cell density was measured using OD600.  In experiments where propagule size was varied, we varied the volume of the first and second introduction events, but kept the total introduction volume (20μL) consistent for all experiments. All OD600 values reported have been blanked using cell free medium.  To confirm that cell density does not significantly change when bacteria were held at 4 ºC, CFU measurements of serially diluted bacteria (no IPTG in the medium) were conducted for each culture at 0 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours as previously described (See Supplementary Fig. S2) (Smith et al. 2014).    Filtration experiment  Bacteria were serially diluted and introduced into 24 well plates as described in “multiple introductions experiment”. After 8 hours of growth, the medium containing   52  initial introduced bacteria was removed from the well, and filtered through a 0.22 µm syringe filter (Genessee Scientific). The filtered medium was placed into a new well in the 24 well plate and overlaid with 500 µL of mineral oil. A second aliquot of bacteria was then introduced as described in “Experiments with multiple introductions.” Plates were shaken at 160 RPM at 37ºC for a total of 36 hours. Cell density was measured using OD600. Eight biological replicates were performed.   Medium replacement experiment  Bacteria were serially diluted and introduced as described in “multiple introductions experiment”. After allowing a 10 µL introduction to grow for 8 hours, we removed the medium from the well, and centrifuged it at 12,118 x g for 2 minutes to pellet the cells. The pelleted cells were  washed twice in fresh M9 medium, and were subsequently resuspended in 500µL of fresh M9 medium (with IPTG). The media was transferred to a new well on the 24 well plate and overlaid with 500µL of mineral oil. A second introduction 10 μL aliquot of bacteria was then added as described in “multiple introductions experiment,” and the plates were shaken at 160 rpm at 37 ºC for a total of 36 hours. Cell density was measured using OD600. Seven biological replicates were performed.   AHL rescue experiment  Bacteria were serially diluted and introduced as described in “multiple introductions experiment”. After allowing a 10 µL introduction to grow for 24 hours, a second 10 µL introduction of the same cell density was made. To the same well we added, or did not add as a control,  100 nM of purified AHL (3OC6HSL, Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI). The plates were shaken at 160 RPM at 37ºC for a total of 36 hours. Cell density was measured using OD600. Five biological replicates were performed.   Growth rate   An overnight culture was diluted 1000-fold into 200 μL of fresh M9 medium (without IPTG) that was contained in the well of a 96-well plate (Genesee Scientific). The media in the microplate was overlaid with 70 μL of mineral oil, and placed in a Victor X4 microplate reader that was preheated to 37oC. Every 10 minutes, the plate was shaken with   53  a radius of 0.1 mm for 10 seconds on the fast setting, and OD600 was measured. Growth was determined by fitting a linear line through the region of the growth curve where there was a linear increase in growth. We then compared the slopes of the these linear lines (R2  0.99). Three biological replicates were performed.   Translation rate  A plasmid (colE1 replication origin, chloramphenicol resistance) containing the Ptet promoter (Lutz and Bujard 1997) controlling the expression of gfp(mut3b) was transformed into competent (Transformation Kit & Buffer Set (Zymo Research Corp., Irvine, CA)) DH5αPRO bacteria (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Isolation of plasmid DNA was acheieved using a Zippy Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research Corp.). An overnight culture of bacteria containing the Ptet-GFP(mut3b)  plasmid were diluted 1000-fold into 200 µL of M9 media containing difference concentrations of casamino acid (0.1%, 1.0%, and 2.0%). GFP expression was activated using 100 ng/mL of anhydrotetracycline (atc). 200 µL of media containing cells was placed into each well of a 96-well plate, was subsequently overlayed with  70 µL of mineral oil, and placed in a Perkin Elmer Victor X4 microplate reader that was preheated to 37oC. Every 20 minutes, the plate was shaken with a radius of 0.1 mm for 10 seconds on the fast setting, and both GFP (arbitraty units, a.u.) and OD600 were measured. GFP (a.u.) was normalized to OD600 and plotted as a function of time. Average plotted from three technical replicates from five biological replicates.   Statistical significance  As indicated in the figure or table legends, we used a student’s one- or two-tailed t-test (un-paired, unequal variance) to determine statistical significance (P ≤ 0.05) using Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA). One-tailed t-tests were used to determine if data was significantly greater than zero. We chose this statistical test as OD600 values cannot be less than zero, only greater. Two-tailed t-tests were used for all other statistical tests.      54  Chapter II References  Allee, W., A. Emerson, O. Park, T. Park and K. Schmidt (1949). Principles of Animal Ecology.

Circuit diagram conferring the Allee effect to our engineered bacteria. An IPTG inducible Plac promoter regulates expression of the toxin protein ccdB, which kills the cell by inhibiting gyrase (Dao-Thi et al. 2005). The luxR/luxI quorum sensing system is activated by IPTG via the Plac/ara promoter. LuxI produces an acylhomoserine lactone (3OC6HSL, AHL), which can be shared amongst all members of the bacterial population. Once the AHL has reached a sufficiently high concentration, it binds to the LuxR protein, and drives expression of the ccdA antitoxin protein (regulated by the Plux promoter). This prevents cell death by interfering with the CcdB protein (Afif et al. 2001). Construction and additional testing of circuit functionality can be found in (Smith et al. 2014).    Supplementary Fig. S2. Temporarily storing the engineered bacteria at 4oC does not decrease their cell density. We serialy diluted bacteria near the Allee threshold in M9 medium (without IPTG), and subsequently stored the bacteria at 4oC. CFUs were measured upon serial dilution (time = 0 hour), and after 12 and 24 hours. P > 0.5 when the 0 hour measurement is compared to 12 and 24 hour measurements (two-tailed t-test). Standard deviation from three replicates. This indicates that in our expeirments with multiple introductions, large changes in CFU in the second introduction event cannot primarly account for growth dynamics observed (Fig. 2, 3 and 4 , and Supplementary Fig. S3).    60  800.10.20.30.40 4 8 12 16 20 2400.10.20.30.40 4 8 12 16 20 2400.10.20.30.40 4 8 12 16 20 2400.10.20.30.40 4 8 12 16 20 24OD600at 36 hoursOD600at 36 hoursTime to Second IntroductionTime to Second Introduction19µL/1µL15µL/5µL5µL/15µL 1µL/19µLSupplementary Fig. S3a bc d      Supplementary Fig. S3.

A summary of conflicting results linking propagule pressure to establishment success. 10 Main Finding Reference Propagule pressure promotes establishment success  Canopy disturbance and propagule pressure of exotic plant invasion are most important predictors of Alliaria petiolata, Berveris thunbergii, and Microstegium vimineum establishment and invasion. (Eschtruth and Battles 2009)  A positive correlation exists between propagule pressure and probability of Bythotrephes longimanus establishment. (Gertzen et al. 2011)  There is a positive coorelation between interception frequency (disruption of propagule pressure) and establishment for Scolytinae and Cerambycidae species. (Brockerhoff et al. 2014)  Using an ecological modelling approach, the product of propagule size and frequency correlate more strongly with invasion success than either single component alone. (Wittmann et al. 2014)  Propagule pressure is positively related to establishment success from re-analysis of New Zealand bird introduction data. (Blackburn et al. 2011) Propagule pressure does not promote establishment success Initial releases of New Zealand bird species explain establishment success as opposed to introduction frequency and high introduction number (Moulton et al. 2012)  Three estimates of propagule pressure (number of introduced individuals, number of areas introduced, and number of years during which species was planted) for 130 species of woody plants did not predict successful establishment and invasion. (Nunez et al. 2011)  Propagule pressure does not determine invasion success for communities with high invasion resistance, particularly for species Urochloa platyphylla, Digitaria sanguinalis, Abutilon theophrasti, and Amaranthus retroflexus, which experience strong density-dependent inhibition (Barney et al. 2016)  Using Pseudomonas chlororaphis, Pseudomonas putida, and Escherichia coli, establishment and invasion success does not depend only on propagule pressure. (Ketola et al. 2017)  Propagule pressure did not influence establishment for Linepithema humile in field studies. (Sagata and Lester 2009)     63 Table S2.

Such difficulties are expected because the lung, which is the most important structure in the respiratory system, is extremely complex. Its rheological properties are unknown and seem to depend on phenomena occurring from the alveolar scale up to the thoracic scale. Conventional wisdom holds that linear response, i.e., Hooke s law, together with alveolar overdistention, play a dominant role in respiration, but such assumptions cannot explainthe crucial empirical sigmoidal shape of the curves. In this doctorate thesis, we propose an alternative theory to solve this problem, based on the alveolar recruitment together with the nonlinear elasticity of the alveoli. This theory suggests that recruitment may be the predominant factor shaping these curves in the entire range of pressures normally employed in experiments. The proposed model correctly predicts the observed sigmoidal pressure volume curves, allowing us to discuss adequately the importance of this result, as well as its implications for medical practiceUm importante problema não resolvido na ciência médica diz respeito à origem física da forma sigmoidal das curvas pressão-volume de pulmões saudáveis (e de alguns não saudáveis). Tais dificuldades são esperadas tendo em vista que o pulmão, a mais importante estrutura do sistema respiratório, é extremamente complexo. Suas propriedades reológicas são desconhecidas, e parecem depender dos fenômenos que ocorrem a partir da escala alveolar até a escala torácica. O modelo clássico diz que a resposta linear, ou seja, a lei de Hooke, juntamente com a superdistensão alveolar desempenha um papel predominante na formatação dessas curvas, mas tais pressupostos não podem explicar a crucial forma empírica sigmoidal das curvas P-V respiratórias estáticas. Nesta tese de doutorado propomos uma teoria alternativa para resolver este problema, baseada no recrutamento alveolar, juntamente com a hipótese do comportamento elástico não-linear dos alvéolos. Esta teoria sugere o recrutamento alveolar como o fator predominante que modela as curvas pressão-volume em um completo intervalo de pressão normalmente utilizado nas experiências.

Amplification of intrathoracic pressure changes may enable their use also during spontaneous breathing. We investigated the association between the degree of hypovolemia and dPP and dPOP at different levels of two commonly applied clinical interventions; positive expiratory pressure (PEP) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). METHODS:20 healthy volunteers were exposed to progressive hypovolemia by lower body negative pressure (LBNP). PEP of 0 (baseline), 5 and 10 cmH2O was applied by an expiratory resistor and CPAP of 0 (baseline), 5 and 10 cmH2O by a facemask. dPP was obtained non-invasively with the volume clamp method and dPOP from a pulse oximeter. Central venous pressure was measured in 10 subjects. Associations between changes were examined using linear mixed-effects regression models. RESULTS:dPP increased with progressive LBNP at all levels of PEP and CPAP. The LBNP-induced increase in dPP was amplified by PEP 10 cmH20. dPOP increased with progressive LBNP during PEP 5 and PEP 10, and during all levels of CPAP. There was no additional effect of the level of PEP or CPAP on dPOP. Progressive hypovolemia and increasing levels of PEP were reflected by increasing respiratory variations in CVP. CONCLUSION:dPP and dPOP reflected progressive hypovolemia in spontaneously breathing healthy volunteers during PEP and CPAP. An increase in PEP from baseline to 10 cmH2O augmented the increase in dPP, but not in dPOP",,article,"Medicine, R, Science, Q",PLoS ONE,'Public Library of Science (PLoS)'

Hemodynamic parameters were recorded before and after VE. In the animal model under anesthesia and pressure-controlled ventilation, the absolute and proportional change of cardiac index after VE (Delta CI and Delta CI%) positively correlated with the square root of PPPS (SQRT-PPPS, r(2) = 0.34 and r(2) = 0.72, respectively).

In some patients, through unknown mechanisms, Ipc-PH transitions to combined pre-/post-capillary PH (Cpc-PH) and is associated with a dramatic increase in mortality. Altered mechanical forces and subsequent biological signaling in the pulmonary vascular bed likely contribute to the transition from Ipc-PH to Cpc-PH. However, even in a healthy pulmonary circulation, the mechanical forces in the smallest vessels (the arterioles, capillary bed, and venules) have not been quantitatively defined. This study is the first to examine this question via a computational fluid dynamics model of the human pulmonary arteries, arterioles, venules, and veins. Using this model, we predict temporal and spatial dynamics of cyclic stretch and wall shear stress with healthy and diseased hemodynamics. In the normotensive case for large vessels, numerical simulations show that large arteries have higher pressure and flow than large veins, as well as more pronounced changes in area throughout the cardiac cycle. In the microvasculature, shear stress increases and cyclic stretch decreases as vessel radius decreases. When we impose an increase in left atrial pressure to simulate Ipc-PH, shear stress decreases and cyclic stretch increases as compared to the healthy case.

Syftet är också att undersöka om uppgifternas utformning har betydelse för elevernas lösningsförmåga. För att få svar på detta användes ett matematiktest där eleverna fick lösa tio subtraktionsuppgifter med olika utformning, samt redovisa sina beräkningar. I undersökningen framkommer att eleverna inte anpassar sina beräkningsstrategier utifrån uppgiftens utformning, bland annat när det gäller om uppgiften är med tiotalsövergång eller utan tiotalsövergång. Vidare framgår att stegvisa beräkningar är den mest effektiva beräkningsstrategin, men att den förekommer i lägst utsträckning. Talsortsvisa beräkningar leder ofta till felaktigheter i uppgifter med tiotalsövergång, men även i uppgifter utan tiotalsövergång. Undersökningen visar också att uppgifternas utformning påverkar elevernas lösningsförmåga och att störst svårigheter har eleverna när det gäller att lösa en naken uppgift med tiotalsövergång, där minuenden saknas.The objective of the study is to investigate whether children in year 3 adapt their calculation strategies on how the subtraction tasks are designed and to determine whether certain calculation strategies are better than others. Added to this, the study looks into whether the way the tasks are designed influences the children´s ability to find the solution. The study makes use of a maths test in which the children are required to solve ten differently designed subtraction tasks and to show how they come to the answer. The study shows that the children did not adapt their calculation strategies in accordance with the way the task is designed, for instance whether the task involves a tens transitions or not. It is seen that incremental calculation is the most effective strategy but also the one least frequently used. Partial sums often result in errors when tens transitions are involved but also with tasks without tens transitions. The study also shows that way in which the tasks are designed does affect the children´s ability to find the solution and that difficulties mostly arise when children are required to solve a naked task with tens transitions, where the minuend is absent",,"Student thesis, info:eu-repo/semantics/bachelorThesis, text","subtraction, calculation strategies, task design, solution ability, subtraktion, beräkningsstrategier, uppgifters utformning, lösningsförmåga",,"Karlstads universitet, Institutionen för språk, litteratur och interkultur"
